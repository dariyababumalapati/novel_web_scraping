   Chapter 1188 The Military Meeting of the First Fleet.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The distinguished commander of the First Fleet put his hands on his hips, looked at the squadron officers under his command, and said in a deep voice: "We received the Crotocata the day before yesterday. The letter sent by Prince Kes, their situation is not good now, the Greek city-states are preparing to quietly unite against our Theonia!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   If the land army cannot defeat Sparta as soon as possible, it is likely to fall into Surrounded by the Greeks, but now that Sparta has received assistance from Persia, its strength has increased. The young prince did not dare to launch a violent attack rashly, so he wrote to us for help.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now the main force of the Spartans is Being attracted to Tegea, the defense power in its territory has been greatly weakened. It is the best time for our 1st Fleet to re-land on the coast of Sparta, capture Sparta, and create the great glory of our navy! Let you go back and think about it yesterday How about a day? Have you come up with a good idea?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as he finished speaking, Sephidorus, the infantry commander of the first fleet, stood up and said decisively: "Sir, I have a way to make our fleet The infantry successfully landed to avenge the brothers who died last time!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Come and tell me!" Sekerian looked at his fleet infantry commander with a look of relief, glad that his fighting spirit was not affected by the last time. Weakened by failure.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I think there are several reasons why the last landing failed." Sephidorus said in a low tone with a bit of regret: "First of all, we underestimated the enemy. Although the Spartans suffered consecutive defeats, they It also has a certain strength. We all saw that day that Sparta had at least 5,000 infantrymen engaged in the battle. Our fleet infantry were all lightly armored. How could they confront them head-on! According to the information just sent by the Army According to the letter, at least more than 6,000 Spartan warriors left the territory and went to Tegea, most of them heavy infantry. In this way, we will face much less offensive pressure when we land next time;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   followed by the Spartans A lot of wooden piles were built near the coast, making it impossible for our warships to get close to the coast. We could only use small boats to transport troops to land. The entire fleet, including clippers, was less than 100 ships, and each ship could only transport troops at most. 20 soldiers cannot transport a large number of soldiers to the coast at once. When our fleet infantry could only land on the coast in loose formations, the Spartans had already formed a dense phalanx to attack the soldiers who landed on the beach. The attack quickly defeated us.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As far as I know, each squadron is collecting cargo ships from everywhere these days. It is said that the number has exceeded 200, which has greatly improved our ability to project troops to the coast at one time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition, we The fleet infantry also figured out a way. They could disembark farther from the coast in deeper water, and then wait there until the second and third batches of troop-carrying boats arrived to meet up with their comrades. After gathering into a square formation, we will march to the coast together -" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But what if the Spartans attack while our soldiers are still waiting?" A squadron commander asked: "And the soldiers Standing in the sea for a long time will consume a lot of physical strength in vain."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sephidorus smiled confidently: "My fleet infantry are all good swimmers and are good at fighting in the sea. The Spartans want to go to the sea. Fighting is what I want. As for standing in the sea for a long time, you will indeed lose some physical strength, but it is still better than launching an attack in a hurry when there are not many people and have not formed a formation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There is also Once we were not familiar with the sea conditions in the Gulf of Laconia. During the landing operation, the wind and waves suddenly became stronger. The ballistas on the warships could not aim accurately, so we did not provide good help to the fleet infantry. I believe this time it will not be possible. Such a bad situation will happen again."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian listened carefully. Seeing that Sephidorus suddenly stopped talking, he asked eagerly: "That's all?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sephidorus straightened his chest. He said loudly: "Of course it's more than that. This time to attack Sparta, I suggest that you change your strategy. It is best to adopt the strategy adopted by His Majesty Davos in the Battle of the Trionto River - first send a small army Some soldiers crossed the river and cooperated with the large forces to attack together."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The Battle of Trionto River?" Sekerian thought about it carefully, his eyes suddenly lit up, and he immediately asked: "Are there any specific measures?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This For a few days, I took a boat to carefully survey the entire coast of Sparta's territory." Sephidorus pointed to the simplified map of Sparta's sea area drawn on the wooden table and said in a deep voice: "The center is where the Spartans defended themselves. The focus is also the focus of our fleet infantry attack.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The western promontory is an extension of the Taygetos Mountains and there is no place for landing, but the Spartans still did not relax their vigilance there because they had to guard against a sneak attack by our troops in Messenia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The headland to the east is an extension of the Parnon Mountains. It is narrower and longer than the one to the west. There is also no place for the fleet to dock, but Spartans are rarely patrolled here. Now the Spartans The main force has been transferred to Tegea, and they don't have enough manpower to defend the east...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I have taken a fancy to several places. We can choose soldiers who are good at climbing to swim over from the boat, climb over the rocks, and climb up. The cliff was then lowered for the following soldiers to board the promontory... I think the mountains there are high and the forests are dense enough to hide two to three hundred soldiers in a short period of time without being discovered. When our main force launches an attack from the front on the second day, If they attack from the side and rear of the Spartans, they will definitely defeat the Spartans!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I think this method is very good and can be implemented!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After hearing this, Sekerian immediately expressed his support excitedly: "We will make a new landing plan according to the suggestions made by Sephidorus. Everyone makes suggestions and improves it. The next landing will be successful." In this battle, we must succeed!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;

      Xenophon is old and doesn't have that much sleep,&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   so&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   he wakes up early.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After washing and eating, the slave specially prepared After breakfast, he left the mansion of Agesilaus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It was just dawn, and there were already scattered candlelights in the city of Sparta. If it had been this time in the past, there would have been many helots carrying farm tools on the streets. , rushed to work in the fields, but there were few pedestrians at this time, and the occasional barking of dogs was particularly clear in this quiet town.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, Xenophon encountered three times while walking on this quiet street. Xenophon responded to the interrogations of heavily armed Spartan warriors who came out of nowhere and went out for morning exercises. The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Spartans built their country on martial arts, were proud of their physical fitness, and were ashamed of being fat, so Spartans It is almost a tradition that Spartan citizens received training from childhood and continued to exercise according to their own habits when they were old. Although Xenophon was not a Spartan citizen, he lived in Spartan territory for decades. The living habits are already the same as those of the Spartans.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition, he was not only the hero of two expeditions to Persia, but also participated in many wars between Sparta and other Greek city-states, and made countless meritorious deeds.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He also wrote books, and every line of his words was filled with praise for Sparta's political system and traditions. Therefore, he was a distinguished guest of Sparta and enjoyed great popularity among Spartan citizens.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Moreover, this time Sparta faced a crisis, he took the initiative to stay in Sparta and was willing to fight with the Spartans, which made the people grateful. Therefore, the Spartan soldiers on duty not only did not make things difficult for him, but all of them Kindly remind him to pay attention to safety during morning exercises and not to go too far from the city to avoid accidents.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Strictly speaking, the city of Sparta is not a city. Although there are many temples and houses and a large population, it has no city walls. The houses are denser toward the center, and the houses are sparse toward the periphery. When you see the east When one piece of farmland comes to the west, it means that Xenophon has left the city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Xenophon walked quickly south along the road on the east bank of the Eurotas River. More than three hours later, the sky was already bright. With his legs sore, he saw countless tents in front of him, and he knew that he had arrived at his destination.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the Spartans learned that "the Theonian army invaded Messenia by sea", under the advice of Agesilaus, they put the focus of defense on the coast and established a They set up a camp and placed the main force of the mobilized army here. At the same time, they also organized a large number of Piliasians and Helots to work with the soldiers to drive wooden stakes and build watchtowers offshore... It is precisely because of this After a series of decisive measures, the Spartan army successfully defeated a Theonian landing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This seaside camp has no walls or trenches. This is because it only serves the purpose of allowing soldiers to rest and prepare for battle at any time. It is not intended to be used as a solid fortress. Once the Theonians land, Success, there is no point for Spartan warriors to garrison the camp, because everyone knows that the city of Sparta has no city walls, and the Theonian army can completely bypass the camp and directly attack the city of Sparta, which will be a disaster for Sparta. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, instead of fortifying the camp, time should be spent on facilities to prevent the Theonian fleet from landing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Xenophon saw twos and threes of Spartan warriors lying outside the tent basking in the sun, and some people gathered together, happily playing a unique Spartan ball game...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing this situation, Xenophon Fen was temporarily relieved: The reason why the Spartans dared to relax like this is that it seems that there has not been any enemy situation so far today. You must know that the Theonian warships approached the sea on a large scale yesterday, and the troops in the camp were preparing for war urgently. , possibly seeing that the Spartans were heavily guarded, the Theonian warships finally left after a stalemate offshore for a long time.&#13;
