   Chapter 1208 Prelude before the war (3)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Olivers glanced at Patroclus and raised an objection: "Now the Greek coalition forces are still attacking fiercely, and the Messenian border defenses are relatively weak. We retreat proactively in case we cannot control it. Well, it is likely to be self-defeating and allow the Greek coalition forces to rush into the Messenian Plains..." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Yes, once the Greek coalition forces rush into the Messenian Plains, even if we retreat to the city of Messenae, those areas that have just been divided into The land of Messenian citizens and the villages they established will be severely destroyed, and our efforts for several months will be in vain!" Tagetinos also reminded.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The most important thing is that the port of Messenia has no defense. There is a large amount of supplies and many ships parked there. If it falls into the hands of the Greek coalition, it will be a heavy loss for us..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Regardless of the reason What kind of mentality? Most of the generals stationed in Laconia and Messenia did not agree with the opinions of Patroclus and Printors, which made Patroclus look unhappy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After listening carefully, Clotokatax pondered for a while, and finally he said seriously: "Generals, defeating the Greek coalition and taking control of Greece is the ultimate goal given by the kingdom to our expeditionary force, and the landing and raid on Thessaly It is the most important military operation to achieve this goal! As part of the expeditionary force, we fighting in the Peloponnese must contain the main force of the Greek coalition as much as possible to ensure the success of the landing operation. Therefore, there is no need to discuss the battle in Messenes. The issue of whether Northern Asia should give in, but should focus on discussing how to make concessions to ensure that our defense does not have major problems! Unity and tacit cooperation are the most important weapons for our army of the Kingdom of Theonia to win repeated battles. Regardless of whether His Majesty personally leads the army, we should carry it forward!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, Olivers and others seemed to see the shadow of King Davos in Clotokatax, and they couldn't help but shudder in their hearts. Dare to speak out again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Printors smiled happily.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the early morning of August 3, the sky dawned very early and was extremely blue, with not a single cloud in sight.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A relatively strong southerly wind blows on the sea, pushing the tides one after another, constantly lapping at the coast.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the two bays of Lagnia and Messenia, thousands of cargo ships and warships rise and fall with the waves, but the soldiers and crew members on each ship stand or sit, all with their upper bodies straight and their heads lowered. Head, hands stretched out, palms upward, eyes closed, silently praying to Poseidon, God of the Sea.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the flagships of the First Fleet, the Second Fleet and the Third Fleet, the three fleet commanders Sekerian, Midorades and Stefankas stood on the bow, holding wine glasses high and singing loudly. An ode to Poseidon, and then spilled wine into the sea to ensure a smooth journey.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Woo!..." The bugle sounded, and the colorful flag representing navigation was immediately raised on the flagship of the Second Fleet. All the warships of the Second Fleet that were already outside the Gulf of Lagnia began to set sail.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Almost at the same time, bugles also sounded in Meselia Bay, and the warships of the 3rd Fleet also dispatched one after another.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Until the crew in the bay could no longer see the 2nd Fleet warships, "Woo!..." The bugle sounded again in the Lagnia Bay.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Croto, it's time for us to set off!" Patroclus on the ship solemnly gave a military salute.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "May Hades bless you! I'm waiting for news of your victory!" Clotokatax on the trestle returned the military salute and also offered his blessing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Patroclus sat back in his seat, and then calmly watched the ship he was on follow other troop carriers full of soldiers as they filed out of the Port of Hilles in an orderly manner. According to previous training, these troop carriers were stationed in Lagnia. Each formed a formation in the bay, and then merged with the squadrons of the 1st Fleet that had been waiting outside to form three large mixed formations and a separate fleet. Then these fleets set sail in sequence from north to south in order of landing targets. ...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This process seems simple, but in fact it is extremely cumbersome and complicated. It takes a lot of effort just to get all the soldiers on board and out of the port. Therefore, there are dozens of clippers in the Laconia Gulf with thousands of Shuttle scheduling between tens of thousands of ships... Although the whole process is still a bit chaotic, overall it is relatively smooth.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   An hour later, it was finally the turn of Patroclus's fleet to set sail.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since we are now sailing against the wind, not only the crew members are rowing hard, but also the soldiers on the ship are joining in, shouting slogans along with the crew members, sliding the oars rhythmically, and the helmsman controls the rudder to let the ship "Zigzag" route, sailing toward the southeast...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   About half an hour later, the fleet rounded the headland. At this time, the crew climbed up the mast, untied the ropes, lowered the sails, and the wind immediately inflated the sails. Starting from the beginning, the fleet, which originally looked like a frail old man hobbling along with a cane, immediately turned into a powerful young man galloping hard. The strong south wind made the entire fleet sail north as fast as wings.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, the Second Fleet had arrived at Saron Bay, and in order to better blockade the Athenian fleet, Midorades also divided the fleet into two parts, blocking the sea passages at the north and south ends of Aegina Island respectively.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After receiving the news, the Athenian admiral Cabrias quickly rushed to the nearby coast. Standing on a high ground, he could see the deployment of the Theonian fleet in the bay more clearly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just as he was thinking about the reason why the Theonian fleet was lingering near Aegina without attacking or leaving, Callistratus, who came after hearing the news, shouted eagerly from afar: " Cabrias, the Theonian fleet that disappeared for a while suddenly appeared again. Are you preparing to attack us?!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I have been observing here for a while, and the Theonian fleet is arranged loosely. The ship array has been blocking the sea channel on the north side of Aegina Island. Although there are attacks on merchant ships that want to enter and exit, it seems that there is no plan to continue to move westward and attack Piraeus... "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Cabrias pointed to the almost stationary Theonia fleet under the coast and said comfortingly: "And now we are ready for the battle in Piraeus Port and Salamiga Island. The ships are all ready for battle, and there are also many light infantry stationed. If the Theonian fleet really dares to enter the narrow channel and attack our port, it will be a good thing!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   You mean? ..." Callistratus walked up to him, looked down at the enemy ships on the sea, and asked slightly excitedly: "Let the victory of Salamiga be repeated?!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is just a wish of mine... ..." Cabrias thought of the naval battle with the Theonia fleet in the Gulf of Lagnia some time ago, and couldn't help but shook his head: "But the Theonia fleet is well-trained and will probably not commit the crime. This is wrong..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "There are a lot of warships in the Theonian fleet!" Callistratus looked down at the sea and asked thoughtfully: "They disappeared in the Aegean Sea for a while. Did you analyze that they were going there?" Attack the islands to the west, so you took the initiative to lead the fleet to attack the Gulf of Lagnia... Now they suddenly appear in the Gulf of Saron. Do you think they have any purpose? Or they just attack us to retaliate against us. Merchant ships?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before and after the Perosponnesian War, the generals of Athens not only had to speak loudly at the council and make suggestions for the development of the city-state, but also personally led the citizen soldiers on the battlefield. This was the case with Kemon and Pericles. Thracybulus even died on the battlefield.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, the frequency of wars also placed high demands on the quality of the Athenian generals who commanded the army, which began to lead to the differentiation of the Athenian leadership. There were politicians like Callistratus who specialized in politics, and there were politicians like Iphicrates and Calypso. A general like Blias who is specifically responsible for fighting.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, Callistratus had a very good relationship with Iphicrates and Cablias, and often consulted them on military issues.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It's hard to say now, I think-" Cablias was still pondering, and a cavalry came quickly: "General Cablias, there is news from Aegina Island, the Theonian warship is not only sealed Blocking the northern sea channel, but also blocking the southern sea channel, blocking and attacking any merchant ships that want to enter or exit!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Callistratus's face changed drastically: "What do the Theonians want? Do we want to completely block our maritime trade?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Looking from here, the Theonia fleet may have deployed about two hundred warships, and if they want to block that end, they may also need to deploy the same number of warships... ...Hundreds of warships, tens of thousands of sailors, such a large-scale operation...just to blockade our merchant ships, it would be more than worth the gain..." Cabrias fell into thinking, and suddenly his expression changed: " If...the Theonian fleet is not only to blockade our merchant ships, but also to block our fleet...to prevent our warships from entering the Aegean Sea and threaten their fleet-"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Fleet? What? Fleet?!" Callistratus was stunned and asked immediately.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Either transporting supplies, or transporting soldiers... The size of the fleet should be very large, otherwise their fleet can completely escort..." As his thinking deepened, Cablias's tone became more and more certain.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You mean they're going to land?!" Callistratus exclaimed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "We don't rule out this possibility! Aren't we always worried about the Theonian army landing in Messenia again!" Cablias said with a solemn expression.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Callistratus became nervous: "We must determine whether the Theonian army is going to land?! Where to land?! Cablias, you must lead the fleet to break through the Theonian fleet! Blockade, enter the Aegean Sea, find out if there is a fleet in Theonia that wants to land, and obstruct and destroy it!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
