   Chapter 1077 Turiyi Household Registration Office&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus said, sighing in his heart: Even a small traffic problem has been so thoughtfully considered. This shows that Theonia officials have been very thorough and meticulous in the governance of the city. It is no wonder that it is such a huge scale. The city can be managed in an orderly manner, which fully reflects the power and prosperity of the Kingdom of Dionysia. The former city of Rome cannot be compared with it at all.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This makes Maximus even more eager to become a citizen of Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He and his family quickened their pace, walked a few blocks, and asked a few passers-by before finally finding the household registration office.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The household registration office is located on the same street as the inspection office, tax office, construction fire station, urban court and other urban public departments. However, compared with other department buildings, the household registration office is obviously much larger in area, because people come to the household registration office to do business. There are obviously more people than other departments.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Today, the hall in the house is probably filled with people, and there are still many people crowding outside the door.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So, Marcim asked his wife and children to wait beside him, and hurried over alone.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When he got closer and heard people's heated discussions, Maximus realized that everyone was gathered here because yesterday all the household registration offices in Turiyi City posted notices: Temporarily suspending applications for Dionis for freedmen. We are waiting for notification when the processing of Asian citizenship will be resumed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus came in a hurry, but was suddenly poured a bottle of cold water on him, feeling depressed and uncomfortable.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I think the same was true for other free people. They lingered at the door, refusing to leave, talking to each other, venting their dissatisfaction, and hoping for a chance to see if there would be a change.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But no one dared to make a fuss or even cause a riot, not only because there was a row of heavily armed patrols standing at the door, but also because they were afraid that they would leave a criminal record that would affect their ability to become a formal citizen in the future.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus sat among the crowd and listened as they speculated on the reasons for the suspension.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   You must know that this is not the first time. Before the Western Mediterranean War, the Kingdom of Theonia also implemented this measure because there was not much land left, so a few people speculated whether this was the same reason this time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But more people refute this, because after the Western Mediterranean War, the Kingdom of Dionysia acquired a large amount of land, and there is still a lot of land that is idle and is in urgent need of development.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Someone came up with a possible reason, and someone else immediately refuted it, leading to endless arguments at the door of the household registration office.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But someone put forward an idea, but no one dared to refute it: He suspected that Hades had sent an oracle to King Davos, so what happened today happened.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This incredible idea actually received a response from some people, who proposed to go to the Temple of Hades to pray and ask this great god to take back his life.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus listened for a while and felt that they were all just guesses without evidence. Thinking about it too: these freedmen who came to apply were new arrivals and had no foundation in the kingdom. How could they possibly get some reliable inside information.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus's mood gradually calmed down. He looked back at his wife and children who were waiting eagerly on the street corner: Since he couldn't get the application for the time being, he'd better find a place to settle down first.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus struggled to squeeze to the door of the household registration office, and the inspector guarding the door immediately asked him what he wanted to do.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Rent a house,&#226;&#128;&#157; Maximus answered.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The inspector looked him up and down and let him in.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus has already made it clear to the employees in the slave camp: if you want to rent a house, you don't have to go to Turiyi City to ask door to door, because most of the rental information is concentrated in the household registration offices in various urban areas.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus walked into the household registration office and saw a spacious hall in front of him. Many people were already queuing up at various counters to handle matters.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, the household registration office not only serves free people to become citizens, it also has many other tasks, such as: registering the criminal records of people in the kingdom, which is mainly provided by the nearby patrol offices and courts every day;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Registering the meritorious service information of the people of the Kingdom, large-scale meritorious service awards such as wars, large-scale public projects... Of course, it is provided by the department, but for some personal meritorious services, he needs to bring the department's certificate and come to register. If it is fake If found out, the punishment will be severe;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There is also the need to register the household registration changes of people in the Kingdom. People in the Kingdom who move from one town to another, or from one urban area to another urban area, need to register at the new urban household registration office. All the original household registration information about themselves will then be Everyone will be transferred, but the procedure is quite complicated and takes a long time, and it is easy to lose some materials and cause losses. Therefore, under normal circumstances, Kingdom residents will not change their household registration easily. Of course, freedmen who have not applied for citizenship are excepted. They are very mobile, but they must register when they move to a place. This is for the convenience of management. Otherwise, if they are found to be unregistered by the inspection station, they are likely to be deported...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Anyone who lives in the kingdom has the most contact with the public sector is the household registration office, and the affairs of the household registration office are also the most arduous among all departments. Small towns are better, but huge cities like Thurii with a population of hundreds of thousands , the personnel in each household registration office are busy every day, so the number of personnel under their jurisdiction is also the largest among the kingdom's departments.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The reason why each household registration office occupies a large area is that more than half of its space is used to store residents' information.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The unique household registration system of the Kingdom of Dioria has caused two important problems: First, it requires a large number of people who can write records. This may be a big problem for other city-states, but the implementation of school education in Dioria has already For almost 20 years, the talents trained are more than enough to meet the needs; secondly, a huge amount of writing materials is needed. Since Egypt and Theonia are allies, most of the papyrus produced in Egypt is sold to the Kingdom of Theonia. And the price increases year by year... This not only makes the Department of Household Registration somewhat overwhelmed, but also the Ministry of Finance continues to complain, because not only the Department of Household Registration consumes a large amount of papyrus, but also the Ministry of Commerce, hospitals, schools... including the Ministry of Finance itself also consumes Big family, the entire Kingdom of Theonia is a country built on the collection, recording, and statistics of data and information.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This dilemma finally forced Davos to put aside his inner entanglements and determined to create convenient and practical paper. He told his wife Christoya some of the processes in the village papermaking workshops that he learned when he was a village official in his previous life, and she arranged for her subordinates to be responsible for the development. Now there has been some progress.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The walls around the hall of the household registration office are all painted with black paint, which at first glance makes people feel depressed. But this is definitely not because the household registration office wants to please Hades and create a hellish environment, but because they can write the information they want to publish on the black wall with a white pen, such as "Suspended free citizen applications." The notice is written in large letters and with a very eye-catching inscription on the front wall, and there is also information such as a certain criminal information of a certain citizen has been determined... and so on.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The released information is written neatly and clearly on each wall, and they are usually kept for two or three days. After people who have registered before read this information, they no longer need to queue up to ask, which also saves the staff time. It took a lot of time to answer.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, some information is published here so that other people who know the situation can read it and raise objections to facilitate tracing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus, like the others, looked up at the wall.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a while, he felt his neck was sore, but he still hadn't seen the rental information. He had to consult the patrol team at the door, and then he learned that the small room next to the hall was where the rental was.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After thanking him, he hurried over.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Compared with the bustle in the hall, it is much quieter here. Except for a clerk sitting behind the wooden counter, there is no one else.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing Maximus come in, the clerk asked enthusiastically: "Are you here to rent a house?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus nodded.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Have you applied for citizenship, or have you not yet applied? Or are you a preparatory citizen?&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I was planning to apply, but now it's stopped.&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After hearing this, the clerk not only did not become indifferent, but became more enthusiastic. He pointed to the opposite wall and introduced: "You have not obtained the application and cannot enjoy the rental provided by the Kingdom. You can only rent private houses. Private rentals." The messages are written on the opposite wall, you take your pick.&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the establishment of Theonia, Thurii has developed rapidly, the population has expanded rapidly, and the rental market has been very hot, but private individuals have always enjoyed this dividend. Later, Minister of Commerce Mariji made a suggestion: various towns in the kingdom, including Thurii, left a lot of open space in the inner and outer urban areas when they were originally planned. Rather than leaving them empty, it is better to build a large number of temporary residences on these open spaces first. Leasing it to freedmen and preparatory citizens who have applied for it at a lower price than the market price is not only a benefit to them who have no land for the time being, but also a little more income for the kingdom's treasury.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the land is readily available, free labor is available, and the kingdom has abundant stone mines and endless volcanic ash deposited by two volcanoes, it does not cost much to build a large number of public rental housing, so this proposal was adopted Firth adopted it and it was quickly implemented by the Ministry of Construction.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Considering that the people who need to rent are mainly outsiders, freedmen, and preparatory citizens, the most common place they go to is the household registration office, so the responsibility for public rental housing is handed over to the household registration department. It can be regarded as Davos giving this multi-faceted responsibility. A little compensation from the department (the Department of Household Registration will hand over most of the rental income to the state treasury, and keep a small part for its own use to hire more temporary personnel when there is a shortage of staff).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the Kingdom has left some ways for private rental housing to survive, the emergence of public rental housing has still had a great impact on private rental housing. In the past, the shortcomings of private rental housing such as too high prices, poor facilities, and inadequate services were more prominent, resulting in many outsiders. Those who prefer to stay in a hotel in the town first, and then apply for public rental housing immediately after the citizenship application is approved. Even though private rentals have improved since then, the rental situation is still not optimistic.&#13;
