   Chapter 1119: Victory in the First Battle After&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   listening to Crotokatax's words, Asistes was silent for a while, his expression brightened slightly, but he still said uneasy: "As for the current state of the coalition forces, I still We need to report to His Majesty and hope that he can send reinforcements as soon as possible."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;

   wants to make adequate preparations while acquiring more Gauls. information and wait for the best fighter to appear.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But there was a sudden change in Etruria.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A few days after the fall of Florentia, the city of Aretium, an area that had not been affected by the war and that many people even thought would not be attacked by the Gauls, was also raided by the Gauls.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The territory where Aretium is located does not actually border the Gauls, but the Umbria. It has always been peaceful before, but it has only begun to be harassed by the Gauls in the past two years.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   According to their understanding, the northern part of the Umbrian people also began to be invaded by the Gauls. Some Gallic tribes fled through the border areas of Umbria to plunder the territory of Aretium. After all, Aretium Mumbo was much richer than the Umbrians.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Originally, the Theonian Ministry of Military Affairs did not plan to build a military camp in this area, because the Gallic activities here were not rampant, but Aretium was one of the twelve Etruscan city-states and an Etruscan city-state. The central town in the eastern region of the Trulia Alliance, under the active activities of the Aretium people (actively allocating a lot of land to Theonia), the Theonia Ministry of Military Affairs finally decided to A military camp was built not far to the northwest of Mu territory.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, this was not entirely convinced by the Aretium people, but after careful consideration, Davos believed that he could use the opportunity of defending against the Gauls to obtain the land here, thereby strengthening the Umbrian people in the east. It is good for the Kingdom of Theonia to contact and enhance friendship.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, for more than a year, the Theonian border troops stationed here have cooperated with the Umbrians across the border many times, repelling the Gauls who came to harass, and won the favor of the Umbrians. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But what they never expected was that the Gauls would detach a large army, pass through Umbria from the southernmost part of the territory, and raid Aretium in the rear.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the Theonian military camp urgently sent a messenger to notify the Aretium people, because it has been protected by the Theonian military camp for a long time, it has not been attacked by the Gauls for more than a year. The attack by the Gauls on the city-state of Trulia did not make the Aretium people more vigilant, so they faced an unexpected surprise attack by the Gauls, but the performance of the Aretium people was better than that of Florentia. Unfortunately, the city fell quickly, and no one in the city could escape.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the Gallic army captured Aretium, they took advantage of the situation to attack south, successively surrounding Curtun and Clevsin, and the forward reached Velzna, which is about 100 meters away from the Kingdom of Theonia. The northernmost towns of Keslera and Veai are not far away.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   People in Rome began to panic.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, Patroclus could no longer remain indifferent. He quickly gathered more than 50,000 coalition soldiers, crossed the Roman Vertebrae Bridge, and arrived at Viai that night.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the second day, the messenger from Thurii had arrived in Rome, and Asistes received an order signed by King Davos: Asistes, the administrator of the Roman region, was required to notify the alliances as soon as possible according to the order. The Covenant sent troops and gathered in Rome to form a coalition army. Patroclus, commander of the Fourteenth Legion, served as the overall commander and led the coalition forces to resist the invasion of the Gauls.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While ensuring the safety of the kingdom's territory first, try your best to help the Etruscans.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the enemy's situation was unclear, the Ministry of Military Affairs did not give specific instructions, and Patroclus made his own decisions based on changes in the enemy's situation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And the Ministry of Military Affairs has notified the Twelfth Legion in the eastern region of Campania (the military camp is in Abella) to rush to Rome that day and fall under the command of Patroclus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, Asistes was also asked to provide logistical support for the coalition forces and report changes in the war situation to the palace at any time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Asistes read the letter with mixed emotions, handed the order back to the messenger, and said in a deep voice: "Please tell your majesty that I will resolutely implement his instructions! Lord Patroclus has led his army to the north, you Set off now and you should be able to see him in Viai."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After hearing this, the messenger said goodbye to Asistes and immediately rode north to pursue him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When he arrived at Viai, Patroclus had already led his army to set off again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The northern Theonian coalition forces arrived at Novi (novi, a small Etruscan city) at dusk, which was less than twenty miles away from Volsena. The Gauls who were besieging Volsena learned that The enemy's reinforcements suddenly appeared. They were really startled. They quickly withdrew the siege and sent out sentries to investigate. They reported back: "The enemy's reinforcements are large in number and have built countless camps."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This Gallic army, as the vanguard, The number of people was small. Seeing that the opponent had a large number of people, they did not dare to launch an attack blindly. Instead, they retreated northward.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the second day, the Volsena people, who learned that reinforcements had arrived and the threat was lifted, came to Lowe with a large amount of labor supplies, expressed their gratitude to the coalition forces, and invited the coalition forces to station near Volsena.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After inspecting the surrounding terrain, Patroclus firmly refused and ordered the army to build a military camp near the city of Lovi.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   One day later, the Gaulish army appeared again in the territory of Volsena, and by the next day the number increased to more than 30,000 people, and the city was surrounded again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There was no movement from the Theonian coalition stationed to the south. Instead, the Gallic army took the initiative to come to the Theonian coalition camp and launched an attack on it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the camp was not completely built, Patroclus' command was firm, and the coalition soldiers had the advantage of defense. In addition, they were more numerous than the opponent. Therefore, although the Gallic soldiers fought bravely, they fought hard until dusk and were repulsed. , which gave the Theonian coalition soldiers, especially the allied soldiers, a little more confidence.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the Theonia coalition won a small victory, they quietly retreated early the next morning, leaving only an empty camp that had been initially built with great difficulty.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the Gauls were sure that the enemy had retreated, they began to think that the enemy had a lucky victory yesterday. In fact, they were frightened by their attack and gave up reinforcements to Volsena because of fear.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the next few days, the Gauls set up a posture to attack the city of Volsena, but the sentinels they sent out found no trace of Theonian reinforcements nearby.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Gradually, the Gauls became more certain of their previous thoughts: the Theonian army seemed to be large in number, but timid and timid, and had probably hid back in the city of Rome.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As a result, they began to attack Volsena with all their strength and boldness.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Several days of attacks made the city of Volsena crumbling, and it was about to be broken. The Volsena people cursed the untrustworthy Theonians and prayed for the blessing of the gods.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Perhaps prayer had an effect. In the early morning of the fifth day, the Theonian coalition forces that had disappeared suddenly reappeared and quickly approached the Gauls camp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, most of the Gallic warriors were too tired from days of siege and were sleeping soundly in their tents. When they learned that the Theonian coalition suddenly attacked, the camp was in chaos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Patroclus used 20 crossbows to blast away the wooden fence, a barrier set up by the Gauls for the simple camp. The main force of the attack was the heavy infantry of the Fourteenth Legion and the Twelfth Legion (just arrived from Campania). The Theonian coalition soon crossed the not-wide trench and started a fierce battle with the Gauls in the camp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the Gauls fought bravely and were quite threatening when wielding the swords in their hands, their lineup was fragmented and disorganized, and they posed little threat to the Theonian army, which was heavily armored, covered each other, and cooperated tacitly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the contrary, the main force of the Theonian coalition was like an iron wall, slowly advancing, while constantly killing the Gauls, it also put a lot of psychological pressure on them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition, the strength of the Theonian coalition at this time was almost twice that of the Gauls, but Patroclus did not send allied troops up from the beginning, but waited until the two legions and reserve soldiers attracted them from the front. After occupying the Gauls, the Allied soldiers were ordered to break in from both sides of the military camp and attack the Gauls.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After more than an hour of fierce fighting, the Theonian coalition almost surrounded the Gauls in the camp. The Gauls had to turn around and escape, desperately fighting their way out.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Patroclus immediately ordered the allied cavalry, light infantry, and light armor, which had been recharging their strength, to pursue them with all their strength.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The coalition forces pursued and fought fiercely until dark before withdrawing their troops, killing, wounding, and capturing countless Gauls.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the second day, the Volsena people were overjoyed to learn that the Gauls had been defeated. They immediately put aside their previous resentment against the Theonians and once again came to the coalition camp with a large amount of labor supplies. Knowing that Patroclus has led the army to leave.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The defeated Gauls were divided into two parts: one fled to Aretium in the northeast, and the other fled to the northwest.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Patroclus detached 10,000 reserve soldiers to pursue the Gauls who fled to Aretium, and he personally led nearly 50,000 allied soldiers to the northwest.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During the period when he was stationed at Camp Lovi, in addition to fortifying the camp, Patroclus also sent out mountain reconnaissance teams and reconnaissance teams to conduct detailed surveys of Gauls' activities throughout the Etruscan region.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, after defeating Volsena's Gallic army, Patroclus immediately led the main force and went straight to the territory of Forfruna, because the main force of the Gauls was entrenched here.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Forfruna was the richest city-state in northwestern Etruria, so it became the focus of the incoming Gauls' attack.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, because the Forfruna people had already learned about their tragic experience from the Florentian people who fled and learned from it, they closed the city gates early and strengthened their defenses.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition, the city of Fufruna has a special location. It is built on a promontory and is only connected to the land by a narrow isthmus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
