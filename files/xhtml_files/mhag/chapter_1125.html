   Chapter 1125 Greece longs for peace&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   , but the Theonian Military Ministry has already studied the Gauls' tactics. Leotychides and Patroclus have also specially trained on this, so they rushed out of the array first. The light infantry of the other legions attacked the horses carrying the carriages from a distance, and then the heavy infantry's phalanx quickly turned into a checkerboard array, widening the distance between the detachments, and reserving passages for the remaining Gallic chariots to enable them to attack even if Even if they rush into the formation, they won't have a big impact on the entire formation, and they will be quickly eliminated.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the contrary, the charge of the Gallic warriors was fired by the javelins of the Theonian heavy infantry, resulting in many casualties.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the close fight, although the Gallic warriors' sword attacks were fierce, they faced the most elite soldiers of Theonia's first, second and third legions, and the fourteenth legion. After several victories over the invading Gauls in Etruria, the Twelfth Legion was equally undaunted. Therefore, the entire front remained motionless, while more soldiers quickly attacked the Gauls' flanks, gradually attacking the Gauls' flanks. Its siege...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Supported by the belief in defending their homeland, the Gauls fought hard for more than two hours and were finally defeated...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Theonian army took the opportunity to cover up the killing, and the two cavalry legions continued to pursue it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Gauls fled all the way, and countless people were killed, wounded or captured.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After that, the Theonian army was even more devastating, occupying all of Gaul in the mountains in just over two months.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;

   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Time has entered the twenty-first year of the kingdom (373 BC). The conquest of Gaul by the Holy Kingdom of Theonia shocked the entire northern Italy. The Neti, Umbrians, and even some Ligurians took the initiative to send envoys, requesting alliance or goodwill with Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The allies in central and northern Italy have also strengthened their determination to closely follow the Kingdom of Theonia. Many Latin allies even saw that the Roman soldiers of the Fourteenth Legion obtained a lot of land after this war, and again There was a clamor for the city-state to be merged into the Kingdom of Theonia so that it could enjoy such benefits.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The conquest of mountainous Gaul by the Holy Kingdom of Theonia caused great disturbances throughout the Western Mediterranean, but for people in mainland Greece, except for a very small number of interested people who paid attention to this matter, most people still paid attention to it. Focusing on Sparta, Thebes, and Athens, the war in Greece continued for several years with no end in sight.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leading the fleet to expedition to Corcyra was the first battle commanded by the famous Athenian general Iphicrates after he fought for the King of Persia in Egypt and returned to Athens. The battle went very smoothly, and the Spartan army stationed on the island of Corcyra was defeated. , but soon Iphicrates also encountered the difficulty of lack of military funds. He had to let his soldiers work in the fields of the Kercyra people in order to survive.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, Iphicrates had to ask for help from his friend in the army, the chief general of Athens, Callistratus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Callistratus, already aware of the difficulties of continuing the war in this state, decided to return to Athens and convince the citizens that they should either provide for the fleet regularly or make peace.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, when he returned to Athens, he found that the citizens of Athens were focused on one thing - the trial of Timotheus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Because of the previous fall of Corcyra, the citizens of Athens blamed Timotheus, and some people also accused him of "corruption and malfeasance" during the expedition. So the citizens became excited and immediately put him on trial. , completely forgetting that it was Timotheus who first led the army to recapture the island of Corcyra and made the Corcyra people join the Athenian League. Moreover, during this period, Athens only provided a small amount of military expenditure, most of which was financed by Timotheus himself. Raise money.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But the trial lasted for several months and never came to a definite result, mainly because Timotheus was well-known in Greece. He received strong support that ordinary people could not match, even Jason, the tyrant of Thessaly. and Alcaitas, king of Epirus, came to Athens in person to prove his innocence.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Because it was the unremitting efforts of Timotheus that these two monarchs temporarily joined the Athenian League, and it was through them that Timotheus was able to borrow money to carry out the Corcyra expedition. Coupled with the cost of the long trial, Timothy has almost gone bankrupt. Now in order to entertain these two distinguished guests and make the food and daily life match their status, Timothy has to pay tribute to his wealthy neighbor, the banker. Xion asks for help.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the end of the trial, Timotheus was acquitted, not because of the support of Jason and Alcaitas. In fact, the citizens of Athens looked down upon these two powerful figures from northern Greece at all, and regarded them as barbarians. The reason was because Callistratus told them: Corcyra had been recaptured.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Timothy regained his freedom, the treasurer of the army he led at the time was tried, charged with corruption and malfeasance, and was eventually sentenced to death.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Athenians no longer trusted Timotheus, and Timotheus was completely disappointed in Athens. This Athenian with excellent command skills (especially in naval warfare) soon left Athens and turned to serve Persia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After successive defeats at Corcyra, the Spartans' disappointment grew.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The attack on Thebes on land still failed to make any progress. In addition, there were several earthquakes in the coastal areas of the Peloponnese this year. The panicked Spartans quickly sent people to Delphi. Ask the oracle.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The priests of Delphi had long been tired of the endless war, because the war had spread to the territory of Phokis (Delphi is located in the Phokis area), so they asked the Pythia to give an oracle: This is Poseidon's battle against Phokis. Badda was outraged by the ongoing war.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So Sparta finally decided to seek true peace.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   They still hope to bring peace to Greece through the mediation of the Persian king like the last Corinthian War.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the Kingdom of Theonia, not far from Sparta, also had the ability to act as a mediator, due to a certain psychology, the Spartans did not have this idea at all, so they sent envoys to the Persian court.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Coincidentally, the Athenians also had this plan.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Because the war has continued to this day, military expenses have become a huge burden on the Athenians, and the citizens' theater allowances may even be reduced as a result.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Another important reason is that Thebes not only was not weakened in this war, but became stronger and stronger with the help of Athens. Not only did they unite most of the Boeotian city-states, but they also fought against the Spartan coalition. Gradually it began to gain the upper hand, and the strength it showed scared the Athenians. After all, before the Corinthian War, Athens and Thebes had been mortal enemies for decades.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This year especially, Thebes raided Plataea, southeast of Boeotia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plataea, a small mountainous state that suffered many disasters, was once besieged by the Spartan coalition because of its firm support for Athens in the Peloponnesian War, and was eventually destroyed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the beginning of this war, in order to contain Thebes, Sparta allowed the exiles of Plataea to return to their hometown and rebuild their homes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Because of its extremely important strategic location, it was the only place for the Spartan coalition forces to pass from the land through the Isthmus of Corinth, over the mountains, and into the Boeotian region. The Thebans had long been interested in incorporating it into the Boeotian alliance. Taking advantage of the fact that the Spartan army's attacks were weakening and its own strength was increasing, envoys were sent many times to persuade Plataea.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While the Plataeans said perfunctorily that they should think carefully, they secretly sent people to Athens, hoping to rejoin the Athenian League.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This matter was noticed by Thebes. At the suggestion of Pelopidas, the Theban army raided Plataea, quickly occupied the city, and expelled the Plataeans from the country. Many people were killed. Forced to flee to Athens.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Isocrates learned of this, he immediately wrote a speech "On Plataea" to express his sympathy for their tragic fate and at the same time condemn the evil behavior of the Thebans.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although this incident did not officially turn these two powerful city-states in Central Greece into enemies, it undoubtedly further alienated the relationship between the two parties.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Callistratus made good use of these reasons and persuaded the people at the citizens' assembly to decide to make peace with Sparta and stop the war.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Athenians also did not consider inviting Dionysus as a mediator: first of all, they thought that inviting the former sub-state to be the host of the meeting would be a bit embarrassing for Athens, and in the past few years, Isocrates has been constantly preaching, It also makes Athens wary of Theonia; secondly, as a mediator of this war, it needs to have sufficient strength and sufficient influence in Greece. Theonia has never set foot in mainland Greece before, and it is also friendly to Sparta had a long-standing peace agreement.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the contrary, although Persia is thousands of miles away, it has been waving its sleeves in various city-states in Greece, constantly using money to win over this one and attack that one. The "King's Contract" successfully signed a few years ago has already demonstrated its influence in Greece.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, Athens also sent envoys to Persia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thebes became a little anxious after learning that both Sparta and Athens sent envoys to Persia to seek support. During the discussion, Pelopidas made the suggestion to seek support from Theonia for the first time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As Thebes' strength has increased in the past two years, the Spartan coalition can no longer blockade Thebes. Therefore, Thebes' top leaders have learned more news from the outside world. What surprised them most was that Theonia defeated Cara. Thage became the overlord of Magna Graecia and Sicily (in the minds of native Greeks, these two places and Carthage are the only civilized places in the Western Mediterranean, while other areas are barbarian lands, not worth taking a look at) ), it can be seen that the Kingdom of Theonia is very powerful and very close to Thebes. It also sold food to Thebes during its most difficult time and expressed goodwill. Therefore, if it can obtain its support, Thebes was not afraid of Persia, which was thousands of miles away.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
