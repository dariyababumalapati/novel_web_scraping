   Chapter 1124: The Great Invasion of Gaul in the Mountains&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It was not until the border legions of Theonia stationed at the Etruscan border and began to curb the frequent invasions of the Senones that they became aware of this new force that appeared in northern Italy. It is not as weak as they imagined, but they think this is mainly because: these invasions are organized by each tribe on their own, and the main focus is on plundering, and no manpower is specially organized to deal with Theonia. human attack.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, the fact that "the Theonians are assisting the Etruscans in defending the border" attracted the attention of the Senones. They were worried that after the Theonians and the Etruscans strengthened their alliance, It would cause trouble for their southward invasion, so they originally wanted to wait until their strength was fully restored in a few years before heading south in a big way, but now the sudden change in the situation forced them to take action in advance.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just in case, the Senones convinced the Cnomani to go south with them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the scale of this invasion was greater than the previous one, the Gallic leaders were full of confidence. After more than a year of fighting, they knew that the Theonian military camp was well-defended, but the number of people was not large, so they did not attack during the raid. Go out of their way to avoid them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The attack went very smoothly at first, and they successively captured Florentia and Areditum, but then they encountered disaster. The main invasion forces of the Senones and Cronomani were successively defeated by Dione. The Asian reinforcements were defeated, and under their relentless pursuit, the defeated Gallic remnant army was unable to organize effective resistance at all.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, the border regiments that had been huddled in the military camp took the initiative to attack at the right time. In the terrible situation of being intercepted in front and pursued by troops behind, the demoralized remnants of the Gallic army were either defeated, killed or captured, or fled in haste. They entered Vernorentia and Aretium, and were then surrounded by the Theonian army. Only a part of the warriors got into the mountains and escaped.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not long after, the Gauls in the territory south of the Po River were very panicked when they heard the news that "the Gallic army going south suffered a disastrous defeat." They were not worried that their territory would be attacked by the enemy. After all, since the Gaul In the hundreds of years since the Lu people settled here, they have always invaded others. No other race has ever dared to invade their territory. They are worried about their relatives who live and die in Etrunia, so Senones and Kenoma After the Nigerian elders gathered to discuss, they decided to ask Sarvis for help and begged him to send troops to Etruria to rescue the surrounded and captured Gaulish people.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just as the top leaders of the three tribes were discussing, in the early morning of this day, the Veneti slaves living in Amirium City were driving a fishing boat out to sea to fish, but they suddenly saw countless huge monsters appearing on the sea in the distance. Warships, although they had occasionally seen one or two similar warships passing by the sea near Arminium City before, knowing that they were warships from the Kingdom of Theonia in the south, but this time the warship came There were so many of them, covering the entire sea surface, that they were really frightened and overwhelmed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Heading towards the coast near La Arminium City was the Theonian First Fleet warship full of legionnaires.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the last war, except for the Kingdom of Theonia itself, there has been no maritime power in the Western Mediterranean. Therefore, under the instructions of King Davos, the Ministry of Military Affairs reorganized the Theonia Navy from the original The four fleets were changed to three: the 1st Fleet is mainly based in Brindisi, and the other naval base is in the port of Tarentum. It is responsible for protecting the waters of Italy's east coast and south coast and monitoring the eastern Mediterranean. Its fleet Commander Sekerian;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   the 2nd Fleet, mainly based in Lilibi and with another naval base in Catania, is responsible for protecting the Sicilian waters and monitoring the African waters. Its fleet commander is Midorades;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   No. The 3 fleet is mainly stationed in Alenia and has another base in Trina. It oversees the important task of protecting the maritime security of the west coast of Italy, Corsica, and Sardinia, and guarding the remaining western Mediterranean waters. Its fleet commander is Sri Lanka. Tefakas.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Among them, the 1st Fleet is the strongest, with a total of 550 warships; the 2nd Fleet is slightly less, with a total of 500 warships; the 3rd Fleet is the weakest, with 150 warships.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is mainly based on the tasks they undertake and the strength of the enemies they may face.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The reason why the number of warships in the Theonia Navy increased a lot is mainly because in the early days of the Western Mediterranean War, both Theonia and Carthage, whose navies were seriously damaged, were stepping up their efforts to build warships in order to gain maritime superiority. As a result, Unexpectedly, the war ended soon. Many warships were still under construction, and they all ended up in Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, after Carthage surrendered to the Theonian Kingdom, some Phoenician city-states also joined the Theonian Alliance one after another. As a result, the Theonian Kingdom no longer had enemies in Africa, and the reduction of the Second Fleet was already underway. Firth and the Ministry of Military Affairs are considering it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, one Theonian warship after another quickly passed by the Veneti fishing boat, which was already shivering with fear, and leaned directly on the flat beach in front of it. It was later called "the most terrifying day for the mountain Gauls" "That's how it started...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The day before landing in the Gallic territory, Theonia's envoys sent envoys to Liguria and Veneti one after another. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Venetians were more interested in attacking the Gallic territory, but the ferocity of the Gauls obviously left them with horrific memories. They finally stated that as long as the Theonian army did not invade the Venetian territory, they would not Intervene in the actions of the Theonian army and provide them with some material assistance.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, the Ligurians argued endlessly about the proposal of the Theonian envoys and could never reach a consensus: some leaders opposed Theonian's attack on Gaul because it would destroy the existing stability in northern Italy; It stated that as long as the Theonian army does not enter the Ligurian territory, they will not interfere with the military operations of Theonia; only a few leaders expressed their willingness to cooperate with the Theonian army to attack the Gauls, thereby occupying some fertile land... ...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Regardless of the response of the two races, the Theonian army set off by ship from Brindisi as planned. After two days and two nights of sailing, it landed on the coast near Alimium and immediately captured the unsuspecting The city of Alimium, followed by the army rapidly advancing westward.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The defenses in Senones were empty and the terrain was extremely flat. The Theonian army was unstoppable along the way, capturing the cities of Boroma and Parma. Then the army turned around and headed north, approaching Cremona (now Cremona). Mona), at this time the Senones hastily gathered all the young and middle-aged people, about 10,000 people, to defend on the north bank of the Po River, in an attempt to prevent the Theonian army from continuing to advance northward, and at the same time, towards Sarvis and Croton. Two Nomani tribes urgently requested help.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides led his army to station on the south bank and ordered all engineering battalions to speed up the construction of bridges and prepare to cross the river. At the same time, he sent troops down the river in an attempt to choose another place to cross the river.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While the Senones prevented the Theonian army from building a bridge near Cremona, they also detached troops to track the enemy's movements, and even entered the territory of the Veneti people. An incident occurred with the Veneti people. Some conflicts (the territory of the Venetians was initially the entire lower Po area, and later the land on the south bank was occupied by the Sessenones).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During the confrontation between the two sides across the river, Sarvis and Cronomani, whether out of brotherhood or out of spite, sent as many reinforcements as possible, increasing the number of Gallic warriors on the north bank of the Po River. The arrival of nearly 70,000 people immediately greatly increased the confidence of the Senones people.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, Patroclus, who had basically eliminated the remnants of the Gallic army in Etruria, led the Third Army, the Twelfth Army, and the Fourteenth Army. Under the leadership of the Border Army, they passed through the Lucca military camp. , first marching on the seaside road, then trekking through the passes in the mountains and valleys, and finally reaching Parma, they quickly marched eastward and surrounded the undefended Gallic town east of Cremona and on the south bank of the Po River. Placentia (present-day Piacenza).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After capturing it, the engineering battalion quickly began building bridges.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since there are several river islands in the river near Piacentia, the bridge was built very quickly due to this convenience.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It only took a day and a half for the bridge to be built, and Patroclus quickly led four legions across the Po River and headed straight for Mediolan, the central town of Sarvis.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After receiving the urgent report, the Gauls realized that they had been deceived and hurriedly led their troops to rescue.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Unexpectedly, Patroclus stopped advancing when he reached Lodi, a small town on the way, and ordered the soldiers to take a full rest and wait for the battle.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the Gallic coalition rushed to Lodi, Patroclus had already led his army in formation outside the town.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, the main force led by Leotychides also crossed the river from Piacentia and marched to the nearby area.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Two Theonian armies, one from the south and one from the north, pressed towards the Gallic coalition. The Gallic coalition was unable to advance or retreat and had to fight.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The only major battle between Theonia and Alpine Gaul on the Po River plain began hastily.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although some nearby Gauls heard the news and joined the battle during the battle, the Gallic coalition was in a dangerous situation of being attacked from both sides from the beginning, and the number was far less than its opponents, but the Gallic coalition The warriors fought desperately and even used chariots against the Theonian army for the first time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Nearly two hundred two-horse chariots rushed towards the main Theonian army that was slowly approaching, trying to disrupt the enemy's dense formation first, and then let the warriors brandish their swords to charge.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, the Theonian Ministry of Military Affairs has long studied the Gauls' tactics, and Leotychides and Patroclus have also specially trained on this. Therefore, the legion light infantry who rushed out of the array first The horses carrying the carriages were attacked from a distance, and then the heavy infantry phalanx quickly turned into a checkerboard array, widening the distance between the detachments and leaving a passage for the remaining Gallic chariots, so that even if they rushed into the formation, they would not be able to escape. Fa had a huge impact on the entire formation and was quickly eliminated.&#13;
