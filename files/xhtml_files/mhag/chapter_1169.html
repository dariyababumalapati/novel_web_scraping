   Chapter 1169 Cruise on Saron Bay.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There is an island in the center of this bay called Aegina. It was a powerful country in Greece more than a hundred years ago, especially in terms of navy, which caused Athens to suffer a lot until Themisto After Klee suggested that Athens invest most of its wealth in developing its navy, Athens gradually began to gain the upper hand in the naval battle with Aegina.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Finally, during the reign of Pericles, Athens entered a golden age. Without Sparta's intervention, Aegina was finally conquered and became the territory of Athens.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The annexation of Aegina, coupled with the fact that the island of Salamis not far to the northwest also belonged to Athens, therefore the northern waters of the bay were within the control of Athens.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Sekerian made a shocking decision, he did not lose his rationality and did not arrogantly let the fleet of warships break into the northern seas and provoke Athens. This would most likely drag Athens, which was originally neutral, into trouble at this time. In order to get into the war and add unnecessary trouble to the kingdom, he let the fleet of warships sail from the south of Aegina.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is of course also a risky decision, because there are some small islands and reefs in the southern waters of Aegina, and the waterway is relatively narrow. The warships of the 1st Fleet who are not familiar with the sea conditions here can line up in a longer column to get closer. Passing at a slow speed, if a hostile Greek city-state fleet suddenly launches an attack at this time, the first fleet will be unable to respond from the beginning and the end, and will surely suffer heavy losses.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In this sea area and nearby sea areas, only Athens has strong naval strength, and according to the information provided by the Ministry of Military Affairs, Sekerian knew that there was an Athens military port on Aegina Island, with some warships parked, so Sekerian Li An had long since lost his previous comfort and began to feel nervous.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The 1st Fleet quickly transformed into two columns and began to pass between the islands of Aegina and Maisana, and then carefully circled to the south of the small island of Agtistri. After that, they The speed gradually increased...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, the south coast of Aegina was full of Athenian people. They watched intently as one trireme after another passed endlessly under their eyes. The faces were all filled with astonishment.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This...how many warships are there?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I have been counting just now. 205 ships have passed, and there is still so long behind. It is estimated that there are at least 400 ships!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This should be Theonia's fleet. Well, I heard that when they had a naval battle with the Carthaginians, the total number of warships on both sides reached a thousand. At that time, I thought that the self-degenerated colonial kingdom was trying to intimidate the forces in the Western Mediterranean (as Aristophanes said back then) The drama "The Theonians" written by him became popular in Athens, causing many Athenian people to believe that the Greeks, the main body of Theonia, ignored their lofty status and took the initiative to incorporate the indigenous people into their own kingdom, grant them citizenship rights, and live together with them. , is a sign of self-destruction), deliberately exaggerating one's own power, but now it seems that it may be true!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   400 warships is nothing special. We used to have more warships in Athens than this, and even now Our number of warships is far less than theirs. With our superb ship-managing skills, we can still defeat them in naval battles!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Young man, it is good to have confidence, but don't blindly belittle the other party. We are all sailors. Look carefully. Let's make an evaluation based on their sailing. The Theonia fleet should be unfamiliar with the sea conditions here, but you can see that their speed is not slow, and the distance between each row of warships and the rear row of warships can always remain stable... In the narrower place in front, their two warships in each row were able to turn very freely without slowing down much, and they never collided... These all show that Theonia's fleet is well-trained, The skill of their sailors is not low, and we must pay attention to it!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Hey! You guys, now that the Theonian fleet has arrived at our door, you still have time to stand here. Blindly looking, shouldn't we dispatch our warships and prepare to protect our homeland!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What do you know as a woman! Look at the direction of the Theonian fleet, it doesn't look like it's coming towards our Athens. Besides, , we have not received the attack order from the General Executive Committee. If we attack rashly and cause a war to break out between Athens and Theonia, we may be found guilty by the citizens' assembly!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just as the people of Athens stood in Egypt While there was a lot of discussion on Ina Island, the vanguard of the 1st Fleet had quickly approached Corinth near the port of Cankorea in the eastern part of the isthmus. The land here was concave inward, forming a small bay. The Battle of Theonia The boat immediately blocked the mouth of the bay to prevent the ship from escaping.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The 1st Fleet arrived by chance. After five Asia Minor troop transport ships entered the port of Cankorea, two more grain transport fleets from Asia Minor arrived near the port of Corinth. "Longwan" news, the guilty thieves panicked and fled into the port in a swarm, causing panic and congestion at the port entrance and causing the port to be unable to close the water gate for a while.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The warships of the 1st Fleet seized the opportunity and rushed into the harbor, trying to hit all the ships they could see flying the flags of the city-states in Asia Minor, even if they were already docked at the dock. In the process, in order to clear the waterway, they would inevitably be knocked over. Other ships...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There was chaos in the port of Cancoreae, and the people on the shore ran and shouted in panic... But for a while, the Corinthian officials at the port could not find any effective measures to stop the Theonian warships from wreaking havoc in the port.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The strength of the Corinthian navy is pretty good among the Greek city-states, but the Saron Gulf in the eastern part of the isthmus has always been dominated by the Athenians. Therefore, all warships are docked at the main port in the western part of the isthmus, Lecaaium, and Even if the fleet is in the eastern port this time, they cannot compare with the number of Theonian warships that continue to pour into the port.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition, more than ten crow warships docked at the dock one after another, and the heavily armed fleet infantry immediately came ashore. However, they neither pursued the people in the port nor seized the port. Instead, they formed a neat square formation of nearly 500 people. Holding shields and swords, they stood on the spot and shouted in unison: "We only attack cargo ships that transport troops and food for Sparta. We have no ill intentions towards Corinth!!! We only attack..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   These shouts of the fleet infantry are really ridiculous. , but it had an effect in the chaotic situation at this time: the Corinthians hesitated, and based on the deterrence of these Theonian soldiers who landed, they neither attacked with rockets on the sentry tower, nor found a way to close the water gate. ...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not long after, the bugle sounded on the First Fleet squadron ship, and all the Theonian warships in the port quickly evacuated.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Corinthian people in the port were somewhat calm, but broken ship planks and shipwrecks were floating everywhere on the sea in the entire port. The voices of the drowned crew members struggling and calling for help could not be heard. It was a tragic scene...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Theonian warship successfully evacuated the Corinth port, which relieved Sekerian. When he was about to issue the order "The fleet evacuates Saron Gulf", the lookout at the top of the main mast suddenly shouted: "Northeast The clipper raised a yellow flag!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian was shocked. He understood that this meant that there were fewer warships than the 1st Fleet approaching, and there was only one person who dared to make such a move in this large bay. City-state - Athens.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian began to get excited, and he shouted loudly: "The stars are rising, and the fleet is heading northeast!" After&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   receiving the order, the captain of the flagship rushed to the stern and asked eagerly: "Sir, are you preparing to fight with Athens? Start a war?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Calm down, Ecritus." Sekerian comforted him and said: "The Athenians have unknown intentions. I am just making preparations. If they dare to attack, then we can just counterattack!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The bugle sounded and the black flag was raised. The 500 Theonian warships originally gathered outside the port of Corinth quickly spread out with their respective squadrons as the center, and marched toward the northeast together while arranging their formations. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not long after, dozens of Athenian warships appeared in the sight of the captain of the frontline warships of the 1st Fleet. This did not have any impact on the Theonia warships, and all warships continued to move forward at a steady speed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The same was true for the Athenian warships.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Six miles...five miles...four miles...the distance between the two sides is getting closer and closer. At this time, the Athenian crew should be able to clearly feel that there is a significant gap in numbers between them and the Delnian fleet, but in the past The glorious record of winning more with less gave them courage, especially since there was a victory monument erected on the island of Salamis not far from them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It was in this bay decades ago that the Greek combined fleet, dominated by Athenian warships, faced off against the Persian fleet, which had several times the number of warships. In the end, it won a brilliant victory, created a miracle of war, and saved Greece... This legendary story inspired generation after generation of Athenian people.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Athenian crew members who were ordered to leave the port today had more or less expectations, which offset the tension in their hearts.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As the distance between the two sides got closer, even Sekerian couldn't help but feel nervous. He was not afraid of the dozens of Athenian warships in front of him. As a senior general of the kingdom at his level, not only himself Just fight comfortably, and you also have to consider what impact the changes in the situation in Greece caused by defeating the Athenian fleet will have on Theonia's military plan being implemented in the Peloponnese. However, the situation in Greece is so complicated that he There was no way to predict it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Fortunately, when the distance between the two sides was close to two miles, Sekerian got the news: The Athenian fleet had stopped advancing!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian hurriedly ordered: Stop the fleet!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The warships of both sides were two miles apart and faced each other quietly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
