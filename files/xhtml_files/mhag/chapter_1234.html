   Chapter 1234 The Establishment of the New Hellenic Alliance (2)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On January 5, the New Hellenic Alliance meeting was officially held. It was chaired by Clotokatax and assisted by Xiros. Nearly 200 city-state envoys participated in the meeting. In the large alliance Even though the framework of the agreement had been established, the envoys still had heated debates over some small details.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On January 11, the final alliance agreement was established. Its main contents are:&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   First, Article 1 is that Theonia, Athens, Sparta, Thebes, Argos... The Greek city-states voluntarily established New Greece Alliance, and voluntarily elected Theonia as the permanent leader of the alliance;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   after the establishment of the New Hellenic Alliance Parliament, each city-state recommended a citizen of the city-state to become an alliance member, which was changed every three years, but the members of Theonia He will always serve as the chairman of the alliance;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   members within the alliance are not allowed to launch wars with each other, otherwise the alliance will form an army, led by Theonia, to carry out crusade against the initiators of the war;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   conflicts among members within the alliance must be submitted to the alliance parliament, which will be decided by Theonia is responsible for forming an investigation team to discuss and resolve the issue;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   if members of the alliance are invaded by foreign enemies, the alliance will form an army, led by Theonia, until the foreign enemies are repelled to ensure the safety of all members of the alliance;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   members of the alliance If you want to launch a foreign war, you can make a request to the Alliance Parliament. If the alliance discussion passes, it will provide help. If it does not pass, it will forcefully launch a war. The alliance will not guarantee the security of its territory, and Theonia has a If any other city-state wants to join the alliance,&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   it&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   must be discussed and approved by the parliament, but Theonia has a veto power;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition, under the deterrence and strong persistence of Theonia, the New Greek Alliance The spheres of influence of the main members of the alliance were also confirmed:&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Athens' territory was recognized as the entire Attica Peninsula, including Aegina and Salamis;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sparta's territory was recognized as Lagnia, including Kissi Island of La (because at the end of the Greek war, Argus surrendered in time and actively sent troops to assist the Theonian army. Theonia returned Taitya, which Sparta had occupied for hundreds of years, to Argos. At that time The Spartans, who were still worried about their own fate, had no intention of objecting);&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   confirmed that Thebes established the Boeotian League led by Thebes, which included the entire Boeotian region, including Oropus;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ( Thebes was the only Greek power that did not oppose Theonia in the Greek war, and supported Theonia in the later stages of the war, which led to faster victory. Of course, Theonia must repay its allies and fully satisfy them. The dream that Pelopidas, Ipamelonda and other Theban high-ranking officials had been pursuing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, regarding the transfer of Oropus to Theban jurisdiction, the Athenian envoys led by Callistratus Firmly opposed, they believed that the Oropians had always been close to Athens and regarded Thebes as their enemy. Oropus had always been considered part of Attica and should be placed under Attica instead of Boeotia...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As Pelopidas also argued strongly, this issue was debated endlessly in the process of drafting the covenant. Finally, Crotokatax intervened and he proposed to occupy Theonia. Aegina was returned to Athens, while Oropus was placed under the Boeotian League. Aegina was obviously more important to Athens than Oropus. Callistratus finally agreed, and Pelopi Das also successfully fulfilled his wish.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   For Theonia, now that Athens has become an ally, it is natural for Aegina to return to Athens, which is exactly the same thing as killing two birds with one stone.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   )&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Confirmed that Mantinia established the Arcadian Alliance with Mantinia as the main body, and that the territory of the original Tegea belonged to Mantinia (this was given by Clotokatax and remained firm in the war The biggest reward for Mantinia, who supported Theonia, was to fulfill the promise he had made before. Hilos even threatened other Arcadian city-states that expressed opposition on this issue, claiming that "if they disagree , then Theonia will come and settle the account with them for betraying Theonia in the war, and Tegea will be their example." In the end, the envoys of the Arcadian city-states did not dare to object anymore);&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It was confirmed that Olympia was under the jurisdiction of Elis, but Elis had no right to prevent the people of the city-states of the New Hellenic Alliance from coming to worship Zeus, or to cancel their right to participate in the games (it can be said that Elis was able to regain control of Olympia in the end, thanks to The intercession of other former Eleans citizens such as Ionicus, who had joined Messenia, and the full cooperation of the Eleans when Crotokatax sent troops to surround Olympia to threaten its priests);&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166; On&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   January 12, envoys from each city-state signed the covenant one after another. Then a famous Greek engraver engraved the covenant and its signatures on a copper pillar three meters high and one meter in diameter. Then the envoys from each city-state signed the covenant. They will face this copper pillar engraved with text in turn and solemnly swear in the name of the twelve main gods of Greece: their city-state will abide by the covenant and never betray!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Finally, the sacred copper pillar will be transported to Thurii and erected in front of the gate of the new Greek Union Parliament under construction.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On March 1, a grand triumphal ceremony was held in Thurii, the capital of the Sacred Kingdom of Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the news of the "conquest of mainland Greece" spread to the territory of Theonia, the people of Greek origin were ecstatic. You must know that most of them are either refugees from the Eastern Mediterranean or descendants of immigrants from the mainland Greek city-states. Even though the country is now rich and the people are strong, there is still a hint of colonial humility deep in the heart, and now those Greek city-states that they once regarded as their mother-state have surrendered to Theonia, so the pride of being proud is beyond words.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   They scattered flowers, sang and danced to welcome the soldiers who had been waiting for this triumphal ceremony for several months.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the platform in front of the Great Council Hall, Davos was as happy as the people, especially when he saw his son striding up, his eyes never stopped looking at him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Clotokatax came close to him, he "bang" his feet, gave an unusually powerful military salute, and shouted in a loud voice: "Your Majesty, Commander of the Greek Expeditionary Force, Clotokatax" Si, salute to you!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At that moment, Hades Davos, who had experienced countless storms and had been in office for more than 20 years, was a little excited. His voice was slightly trembling and he said: "My child... you have lost a lot of weight, but you look more energetic!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   You did a great job and lived up to my expectations of you!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   My father's kind words melted away the perseverance that Crotokatax had cultivated during more than half a year of fighting. He suddenly had red circles in his eyes and whispered guiltily: "Father, please forgive me, I didn't take good care of my eldest brother!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos comforted him softly: "This is not your fault! Your mother and I did not blame you, and neither did Cynthia and Aidui! After the triumphal ceremony is over, we will go home together to Adoris's grave. Come and worship!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He patted Crotokatax hard on the shoulder, handed the golden scepter into his hand, and said encouragingly: "But now you must cheer up and celebrate with the people of the kingdom. This great victory was bought with the blood of countless soldiers!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotokatax nodded, tried his best to smile, and turned with Davos to face the thousands of soldiers and people in the square, standing tall He raised his scepter.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The cheers suddenly rose higher and higher like a raging ocean tide.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A month later, Davos appointed Clotokatax as the consul of the Holy Kingdom of Theonia, and he worked with the six auxiliary ministers to handle state affairs.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;

  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Attica&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   in Athens There is Mount Aigaleus in the territory, with the city of Athens to the east and a small town called Selesia at the foot of the mountain to the west. Because of the high-quality pottery clay on the nearby river bank, it is famous throughout Greece for its pottery industry.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There are many pottery houses and kilns in the town. Every day, countless smoke pillars rise here, day and night, shrouding the entire town in smoke and dust.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Outsiders often feel worried for the town residents when they see this situation, but at this time the Athenians will calmly tell them: This is a good thing, it means the prosperity of the Athenian pottery industry!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, this is indeed the case. Even after the New Hellenic Alliance was established and Theonia became the new overlord of Greece, the worries of the Athenian pottery merchants did not appear. Not only did the Athenian pottery industry not decline, but the orders were far greater than before.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Early in the morning, Heskraus set out from the suburbs of Athens with a pack team and rushed to Thracia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A large house near the town gate in the west area of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;the town was his pottery yard. As soon as he entered the yard, the foreman in charge of the entire pottery factory immediately came to report to him: the last batch of pottery was about to leave the kiln.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He immediately rushed to the kiln. The kiln had just been opened. In the hot air filled with black ash, pieces of red-burned pottery were displayed in front of everyone's eyes: their shapes were various, but they were all different from traditional ones. Athenian pottery style.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Everyone present was accustomed to this, because these pottery was customized by the buyer, and these styles were also provided by the buyer, who was a Turiyi merchant.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   You must know that when Heskraus initially handed over the new patterns provided by the buyers to the potters who were responsible for making embryos and shapes, these skilled Athenian potters refused to make them, thinking that these styles were deviant and random designs.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   For this reason, Heskraus fired potters one after another. The potters' collective boycott once put his just-started pottery business into dire straits. But later, more than half of the pottery fields in Thracia received pottery from Theonia. orders, and the price was considerable, the potters who needed to be clothed and fed finally chose to give in.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While waiting for the temperature of the pottery to cool down, Heskraus went to the vase painting room next to him. He wanted to express his gratitude to the painter Onesimus and his assistants who painted the patterns for these pottery works, and to give him generous remuneration. .&#13;
