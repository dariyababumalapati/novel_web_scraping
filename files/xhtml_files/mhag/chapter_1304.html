   Chapter 1304 Persia's Strategy (2)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Enough time?" Orontas also said coldly: "I don't think so! The news that came before said that the Theonians detached part of their troops to the west to capture Iraq. Cities such as Sous and Castabrorum opened the road from Silesia to Syria. Farabazos only harassed and did not dare to block the Greek coalition forces directly. As long as the Greek coalition forces passed the Tauchis Mountains, they could Smoothly arrive at Syria and join the Theonian army, which will undoubtedly greatly increase the enemy's strength!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this point, Orontas turned around, bowed respectfully to the King of Persia, and then said solemnly : "Your Majesty, Greek soldiers have very strong melee combat abilities, and this time the Theonians also brought together the most powerful armies of Sparta, Athens and Thebes among the Greek city-states. Although according to Panabazo According to Sri Lanka's battle report, it was the rebellion of the Greek mercenaries that led to the failure of the entire battle, but it may also be that the Greek army led by Spartan, Athens, and Theban soldiers first defeated the left wing guarded by our troops, which led to the failure of the entire battle. The entire war situation has changed suddenly, so we must defeat the Theonian army in Syria as soon as possible before the Greek coalition forces arrive, in order to secure the final victory of this war!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   That year, Orontas was ordered to intercept the Greek expeditionary force, and the result Suffering a disastrous defeat, the terrifying impact of the Spartan warriors left a deep impression on him, so this big man who had been governor of America for decades and was like an emperor was able to temporarily abandon the arrogance of the Persian nobles and issue a warning .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   His words immediately made Artaxerxes's face turn ugly, because he also had the same memory: in the battle with Cyrus the Younger, he witnessed tens of thousands of Greek heavy infantry charging into the sky. His left wing was routed, and he was almost driven into despair.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   For several other generals present, it was obvious that the Greek army was able to defeat Darius and King Xerxes twice, and maintained an advantage of more wins than losses in the battles with the Persian army in the following decades. They are more worthy of their attention than the Theonian army, which has not achieved a brilliant victory against the Persian army so far (in the Battle of Cyprus, the Persian fleet suffered a disastrous defeat, which did not shock the Persian nobles, because naval warfare was not what the Persians were good at, and the entire There were almost no Persians participating in the Persian fleet. As for the battle in western Asia Minor, Artaxerxes did not announce the true situation, so Pharnabazos's battle report led them to make a wrong judgment. The Persian army's The defeat came mainly from the betrayal of Greek mercenaries).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing that everyone in the room was focusing on him, Trebasus felt nervous. He knew very well: at the beginning of today's meeting, Mardonius, Harpurgus, and Orontas He successively questioned the strategies adopted by the Persian army, which was actually an expression of dissatisfaction with him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Trebassus had a long-standing conflict with these top Persian nobles, and the root cause came from jealousy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The King of Persia regarded Trebassus as his confidant and obeyed his advice. This was obviously unmatched by several important ministers of the kingdom who were far away from the royal court. Of course, this also involved the contradiction between the old Persian nobles and the emerging nobles.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the army joined together, they had expressed their dissatisfaction with Trebassus many times, but with the support of the King of Persia, the matter ended up being settled. But today, their joint attack caused Trebassus to leave Artaxerxes. Si looked at him and felt something bad: this king with mediocre military performance was wavering on whether to continue to implement the strategy he proposed!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Fortunately, he was prepared in advance and calmly took out something from his arms and said softly: "This is the most capable man sent by Lord Marktonos. After many investigations and a lot of time, I made a copy of the carefully drawn map of the Theonia army camp for you to take a look at."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As he spoke, he unfolded the white cloth in his hand and placed it in the open space in the center.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Marktonos, who was originally watching from the sidelines, walked over first, looked down at the cloth placed on the ground, and then said: "This is indeed the map of the Theonia camp drawn by my men."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mardonos, O. Jontas and Halpurgus walked over slowly and looked at it casually, but soon their faces showed surprise and they bent down to take a closer look.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing this, Artaxerxes asked the eunuch to bring a table and place the map on it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While the three of them were looking at the map attentively, Trebassus said in a deep voice: "Five years ago, the Theonian army invaded Greece. The Greek city-states united and formed an army of nearly 100,000 people. Originally, There was a chance to repel the Theonian army, but the Theonians built a complex defensive camp to lure the Greek army to attack. The number of Greek soldiers was two or three times that of the Theonian soldiers in the defensive camp, but The siege lasted for more than two months, but they did not achieve much. Instead, the Theonians took advantage of the Greeks' long-term fruitless attack and empty rear defense to send troops to land in Thessaly. In the end, Greece fell to the Theonians. Ah, alas..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This sigh seemed to twist Artaxerxes' heart, making him lean back in his chair: If it weren't for the rebellion of the people of Asia Minor, Persia would have been recaptured by him long ago, and even Asia Minor was nearby Support, Greece will not surrender so soon!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  ---&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The Theonian army wants to repeat its old tricks this time. You see - its camp relies on mountains on both sides and a bay at the rear. We can only attack from the front, and the width of this front is narrow. It is obviously not conducive to us taking advantage of the large number of soldiers."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Trebasus gestured on the map and said earnestly: "Look again - the camp they built actually has two layers of wooden walls, and the wooden fence in front is very It is only about one meter low, and the wooden wall behind it is 4 meters high. The two walls are 30 meters apart, and there is a trench in the middle. Although our spies cannot detect the depth of the trench, according to the Theonian army's victory in Burrow Judging from the situation of the Pennesian defense operations, it is difficult to cross easily. It will be more difficult for our soldiers to reach the wooden wall at the back and it will take a lot of time. And you see-the wooden wall at the back The towers on the wall are densely packed, and the Theonians will inevitably place a large number of archers on them to carry out fierce long-range attacks on our attacking troops.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition, Lord Halpurgus's men also mentioned an intelligence that we need Attracting attention. During this period, the Theonian army sent a large number of soldiers to set up traps in front of the camp without stopping... Based on what we have learned, we can know that the Theonian camp is very well-defended, and our Just to attack the real wooden wall of the camp, the army may pay a lot of casualties. Let alone a long siege, it only takes one or two failed attacks, and those affiliated troops may lose their fighting spirit. Once they recharge their batteries, If the Theonians launch a full-scale counterattack, the situation of our army will be very dangerous!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The three Persian nobles have been commanders of troops for a long time and are all considered to be proficient in military affairs. Looking at this map, it is natural to understand that Trebasus's words are not alarmist. , even though he hated this person, he did not refute bluntly. Instead, he stared at the map and thought hard, hoping to find a solution to the problem.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a brief silence, Orontas asked unwillingly: "Are we going to stay here all the time, doing nothing, just watching the Theonian army and the Greek coalition join forces?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Trebasus was waiting for the other party to ask this question, and he replied calmly: "The Theonian army invaded our country aggressively, and successively captured Canaan, Feiji, and Syria. Originally, we thought they would continue to attack The east invaded Mesopotamia, so the king personally led the army to Taposakus, but the Theonians cunningly stopped advancing and wanted to consume us through defense while waiting for the rendezvous of the Greek coalition forces. , Of course we can't let the Theonians get what they want, so we must force them to leave the camp and take the initiative to attack us, so that the entire battle situation will be more beneficial to us."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Halpurgus sneered: "Since the Theonian army can The sudden shift from a smooth offensive situation to a defensive situation shows that their king is more cautious and wants him to abandon the camp he has built, lead an army far smaller than ours, and take the initiative to attack us. Unless he is a fool, otherwise this will It's simply impossible!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Trebassus replied confidently: "I have learned about King Theonia in detail. This is a very confident and bold Greek. He has repeatedly led armies smaller than the enemy's and took the initiative. He launched an attack and achieved victory. This is one of the reasons why Theonia expanded rapidly in just a few decades and became our opponent. It can be seen that he is not someone who dare not take the initiative to launch an attack because of the small number of troops. , on the contrary, he is very adventurous. Only because the king led the army to arrive in time and the difference in strength between the two sides was too great, he temporarily took a defensive position to wait for reinforcements. But as long as we pay some price, I believe he will have to give up defense and take the initiative. Ask us for a decisive battle!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "At what price?!" Artaxerxes asked eagerly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Trebassus looked at the Persian king with an extremely serious expression and said in a deep voice: "Your Majesty, the reason why Pharnabazus was able to hold back the Greek coalition forces was mainly because he burned and evacuated the villages and towns on the path of the Greek coalition forces' advance. , making it impossible for the Greek coalition forces to collect any food and supplies, making their transportation and supplies difficult. Now we can also adopt similar tactics to evacuate all the people in the area near Taposacus, burning the villages and the supplies that cannot be taken away, Let there be a white space between Taposakus and Syria..."&#13;
