   Chapter 1309 The Battle of Taposakus (1)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "But why can't I see a single Persian?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I heard that those Persians only know how to bully subordinate races. They are all very lazy. I'm afraid they are sleeping in the camp. Yeah, haha..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Hey, what are you doing?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the soldiers who were chatting and joking saw their comrades lying on the grass and resting, they suddenly turned sideways and put their ears to the ground. After a while, they shouted loudly: "Persia The people are coming!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the prompt of their teammates, the soldiers were surprised to find that the dry mud under their feet was shaking slightly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a while, the Theonian soldiers began to vaguely hear rumbling sounds from far ahead, as if muffled thunder was rolling on the clouds on the horizon, and the sounds became clearer and clearer.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then, a brown-yellow cloud appeared at the junction of the sky and the earth, slowly drifting towards the direction of the Theonian army. It gradually turned from the small smoke column at the beginning into a cloud covering the sky and the earth, spanning more than ten miles. The billowing dust storm.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Under the reflection of the sun, countless rays of light shone in the gray dust and mist, layer upon layer, like stars in the sky.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   From the huge dust mist that shrouded the surrounding areas came the sounds of shouts, the neighing of horses, the sound of footsteps, the collision of armor and weapons, and even the roar of beasts... Various sounds were intertwined together, like the sound of thousands of drums, shaking the sky. Shaking the ground, making people irritated and heart palpitating...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the dust mist moved closer, the sharp-eyed Theonian soldiers could see through the flying dust and see the scene inside from a distance: This is a real sea of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;people!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Tens of millions of soldiers dressed in various colors, holding various weapons, speaking different languages, densely packed and boundless, like a vast sea, surging toward them, with a heavy pressure. Even suffocating them to the point where they couldn't breathe...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Many Theonian soldiers changed their faces.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, the commander of the First Army, Matonis, laughed loudly and said: "The Persian army is still the same. Although they have many soldiers, they are actually useless! Think of the time when we helped the Persian prince Cyrus fight for the throne. , just a few hundred miles ahead, Cunarisa fought a battle with the Persian army. The commander of the Persian army at that time was today's King of Persia. The number of their soldiers was about the same as today, far more than Cyrus the Younger. army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But as soon as the battle began, the right wing composed of our Greek heavy infantry defeated the left wing of the Persian army with a single charge. If Cyrus had not acted recklessly and risked charging into the battle and was killed, the throne of Persia would have changed its owner long ago. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Today, the number of our soldiers far exceeds the army of Cyrus the Younger at that time. Our army is more well-trained than the Greek mercenaries at that time. Our arms are more complete than the Greek mercenaries at that time. Our tactics are better than those of the Greek mercenaries at that time. The mercenaries are more advanced... We will definitely be able to easily defeat the Persian army on the opposite side, which looks strong but is actually weak!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Matonis's words greatly boosted the morale of the soldiers of the First Legion.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, Trotilas and other veterans in the army were giving similar speeches to the soldiers under his command.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing that the soldiers had returned to normal, the legion commanders issued orders one after another: "Gather the entire team and prepare for formation!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Davos arrived, the sky was filled with dust and fog on the side of the Theonian army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty!" Alexis, Matonis, Lizaru, Felicius, and Thormid hurriedly arrived on horseback.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked at the legions in front of him who were still in marching column formation. After returning the salute, he asked: "The formation has not started yet?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alexis replied: "The Persian army is very large, but it is too chaotic. If you want to wait, It may take a while for the Persian military formation to take shape, so after some discussions, we decided to let the soldiers rest first. According to the slow pace of the Persians, we will wait until the location of their central army is determined before starting. It's totally time to form an array."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos nodded slowly, and just as he was about to speak, Amyntas shouted from behind: "Since the Persian army is huge and chaotic, why not take this opportunity to launch an attack?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos said heavily He coughed and said in a deep voice: "This battle is attracting the world's attention. If we attack while the opponent is not in formation, even if we win, we will be ridiculed by the people of other countries. I need an upright and glorious victory to impress the Persians! And! , I need to severely damage the main force of Persia in this battle, so that the Persians will be unable to fight against us later. If we launch an attack in advance, it will only cause the Persians to retreat early, but they will not be able to achieve great results!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Amyntas was so embarrassed that he was unable to fight us.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Be true to your word.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos didn't care about Amyntas's mood at the moment. He continued: "Let's go to the front and have a look!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After that, he drove his horse forward, and the palace guards immediately stepped forward to surround him in the center. Alexi Si, Felicius, Matonis, Lizaru, and Thormid had no time to stop them, so they had to follow.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Amyntas, Hieronymus and others could only stay where they were because they no longer had military duties.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos rode through the gap between the legions and came to the front of the team. Looking eastward, the Persian army was stationed a mile away. Although dust and mist were still flying, the flat and vast plains were unobstructed. The situation inside can be seen relatively clearly, and the shouts of the Persian generals can even be heard.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Persian army ran for more than ten miles from north to south. In order to have a more comprehensive understanding of the Persian army's formation, Davos rode on horseback from south to north at the front of the Theonian army, observing the situation of the enemy on the opposite side as he walked.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, when the Theonian soldiers saw their beloved king passing by, they were all excited and shouted: "Your Majesty is victorious!!! Your Majesty is victorious!!!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The news quickly spread throughout the army. , the noise increased even more, like bursts of winter thunder, completely covering up the noise coming from the opposite side, forcing Davos to turn an enemy inspection into a pre-war army patrol, which also aroused the Persians' concern. curious.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What happened?" King Artaxerxes of Persia at the rear of the army heard the thunderous roar and couldn't help but ask Pesitidai, the commander of the undead army in front.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Soon Tanma sent back the news: "Report to the king, it is the king of Theonia who is reviewing the army."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The outcome of the battle is not determined by the strength of the voice." Artaxerxes said angrily. In fact, he knew very well that if he were to review the Persian army, it would be difficult to achieve such a lasting result. The cheers were not only because of the auxiliary troops, but also because of his lack of prestige among the Persian soldiers. It was precisely because of this jealousy that he impatiently said to Trebasus next to him: "Urge the troops to complete the formation as soon as possible. , Defeat the enemy as soon as possible, end this noise as soon as possible!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Persian army stretched for more than ten miles from north to south. Although the Theonian army did not spread out, the legions were almost evenly distributed within a dozen miles. In order to save horsepower, Dai Firth had to smile and wave to the soldiers while controlling his horse to move slowly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   More than half an hour later, he started to return from north to south.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, look! That should be Artaxerxes there!" Alexis suddenly pointed to the east and said loudly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I saw a magnificent carriage in the Persian army on the opposite side, pulled by four pure white horses, and on top of the carriage stood a person, wearing gorgeous clothes, reflecting the sunlight, which was particularly dazzling.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos reined in his horse and was a little curious to take a closer look at what this opponent, known as the King of Kings, looked like.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Artaxerxes was also looking intently at the king of Theonia wearing a crown in front of him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The two sides looked at each other for a while with a distance of more than a mile, and then Davos moved his eyes to the front of the Persian king: a dense array, a thick round shield, a helmet that completely covered the cheeks...it turned out to be a Greek heavy armor. infantry!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos was not too surprised because he had already learned from Leoticides' report on the battle in Asia Minor that there were a large number of Greek mercenaries in the Persian army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He also carefully observed that the spears and spears stood upright in front of the Persian King's carriage, like a dense forest. It could be seen that the infantry column was quite thick, and there were longer spears behind the erected spears, and through the swaying Greek heavy weight Between the infantry, he saw bearded soldiers wearing long robes, golden armor, and holding spears and large shields. Corresponding to the information he had learned, he knew clearly: the Persian Undead Army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He immediately pointed to the carriage of the King of Persia and said with certainty: "The center of the Persian army is right there!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, Davos did not need to say more. Alexis himself had already made the same judgment, so he waited for Davos to When returning to the rear of the team, the formation of the entire Theonian army began.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The staff officer of the First Army rushed to the front of the First Army and said to the flag bearer of the Legion: "Lead the troops to follow me and go to the position where the First Army is arrayed."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hearing this, the flag bearer waved the flag and was resting. The soldiers of the First Legion immediately stood up and quickly lined up.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The 6,000 heavy infantrymen of the First Legion, led by the staff officer, bypassed several brother troops and came to the position facing the Persian king's carriage.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Platoon dispersed array!" As soon as the staff officer in front shouted, the six heavy infantry captains commanded their respective brigades to spread out in a formation of three brigades horizontally and two brigades vertically, and each of them widened the distance between them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Immediately afterwards, the captains of each company commanded the soldiers under their command to quickly form a square formation, and then the squad leaders split it into four small square formations, arranged front and back... In less than&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   10 minutes, the soldiers of the First Legion completed the formation. , the reason why Matonis did not take command personally was because in this battle, he was not only the commander of the first army, but also appointed by Davos as the commander of the center. He also needed to give orders to other legions.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   With the first legion as the base point of the entire array, all legions began to take action. The generals and team officers did not command the soldiers by shouting like the Persians, but used semaphores to guide them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The soldiers also strictly followed the orders and did not joke or joke during the formation. In the stirring dust and mist, there was only the sound of footsteps and the collision of armor and weapons, and there was almost no noisy human voice. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
