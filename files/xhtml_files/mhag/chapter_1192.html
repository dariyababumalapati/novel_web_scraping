   Chapter 1192 Conquering&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sparta Sephidorus moved his right hand slightly and said calmly: "I was accidentally shot. Fortunately, no muscles or bones were injured. The bleeding has been stopped. Now it's gone."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It's okay, but I can't salute you for the time being."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Wait until the medical camp arrives, and then let them give you serious treatment. You are the hero who defeated the Spartans now. Don't let your carelessness lead to wound infection and cause Serious illness, resulting in being unable to enjoy any honor..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Sir, are you caring about me or are you cursing me?!" Sephidorus said dissatisfied.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian was relatively casual when getting along with the senior officers of the First Fleet. He laughed: "There is no need to salute the military salute for the time being. It will be made up for later. What is the situation now?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Spartans sent a The envoy asked for peace talks with us. I can't make the decision, so..." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   We have completely defeated the Spartan army. They have no power anymore. Our soldiers can easily occupy Sparta. Dacheng, at this time they want peace talks? Are they dreaming! Drive this envoy away, and we will lead the army into the city." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This envoy said that he was Xenophon, a good friend who had accompanied His Majesty Davos on an expedition to Persia. ."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "His Majesty's friend?" Sekerian finally showed a somewhat serious look, but he pondered for a while, and then said: "I think your Majesty will never give up what is best for the kingdom just because of personal friendship. Measures... In this way, you&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   go&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   tell that... color...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   My lord, he agreed to Sparta's surrender, but -" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But the Theonian army cannot enter the city of Sparta and cannot harass the people of Sparta!" Xenophon, who was following Sephidorus, shouted loudly said.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian raised his head, looked at him sideways, and sneered: "We are not allowed to enter the city of Sparta and cannot arrest the Spartans. What kind of surrender is this!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Sparta surrenders to Theonia Surrender, give up all the city-states under control, retain only Sparta's original territory, and even accept some reforms of Sparta's political system by Theonia, and the Spartans will maintain offensive and defensive consistency with Theonia in the future. No matter who Theonia goes to war with in the future, Sparta must fight with it... General, in the Peloponnesian War that year, Athens ultimately failed and surrendered to Sparta, and the conditions it accepted were almost the same. Now the surrender conditions proposed by Sparta are even more stringent, which is enough to show our sincerity. Isn't this enough?" Xenophon said without being humble or arrogant.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian still looked doubtful: "These conditions you mentioned...have the Spartans agreed?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "They have granted me full power and will never object!" Xenophon said firmly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian showed a few sneers again, looked at him, and said bluntly: "To be honest, I don't believe your surrender, because the main force of Sparta is still in Arcadia, and you only need to delay They can return quickly in a day or two... Haha, so both the Spartan commander who was on the beach before and you now have proposed not to let us enter Sparta City to facilitate their return. Save!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "General, since the Spartans promised to surrender, they will keep their promise and will never go back on it!" Xenophon said excitedly as if he had been insulted: "They are Heracles Their descendants, they swore in the name of Hercules that they would never break the agreement!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You make it sound like the Spartans can keep their promises just like us Theonia, but I don't believe you!" Sekeli An shook his head and said sarcastically: "I think that when so many city-states in Greece signed that king's contract together, they swore an oath to the gods, but you Spartans violated it not long after. After signing the contract, we suddenly attacked the city of Thebes..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Then what can we do to make you believe it?" Xenophon was at a loss for words, and soon he asked anxiously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian ignored him and turned to Sephidorus and said: "The soldiers have had enough rest. Gather them immediately, enter the city of Sparta, and capture all the Spartans." Get up!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Xenophon became anxious upon hearing this, stepped forward and grabbed Sekerian's sleeve, and said earnestly: "Wait a minute! General, you can't do this!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian will He waved his hand vigorously: "There's him, catch him too!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After receiving the order, the fleet infantry and soldiers of the Seventh Legion quickly formed a long and loose horizontal formation, stepping on the wheat fields, vegetable fields, and vineyards, Passing through sparse and deserted thatched houses...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As they approached the dense group of houses, they were surprised to see many old people, women, and even children appearing between the houses, all holding spears, daggers, and even wooden sticks. , glaring at them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The entire Theonian army stopped advancing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Sekerian learned the news, he was silent for a moment, and then ordered in a deep voice: "As expected of Sparta, a country founded by force. Since it takes up arms, it is an enemy! Tell the soldiers not to be careless, let alone be kind. , attack them immediately! But if they put down their weapons and stop attacking, they can no longer kill, but can only arrest. Do you understand?!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Understood!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;

  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the King's Office of Thurii Palace, Davos was listening to the report from the intelligence chief Aristiras: "Your Majesty, we have received reports from Greece in the past two days. According to a secret report, the citizens' assembly in Athens has passed the decision to join the Greek Alliance and is preparing to declare war on us. It is currently conducting military mobilization throughout the Attica region and has begun to prepare a large amount of military supplies. At the same time, it is also cooperating with the Delphi priests to send troops to surrounding city-states. They sent envoys in an attempt to unite these city-states and declare war on us..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After hearing this, Davos frowned slightly, then relaxed again, and murmured calmly: "Don't look at the Athenians who often Talking about "freedom, equality and resistance to tyranny", in fact, compared with the Spartans who were hindered by the helots and focused more on stabilizing their own territory, the Athenians were much more ambitious. They wanted&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   to They also wanted to control the Aegean Sea because it was the source of their wealth; they also wanted to control the Eucalyptus Sea because it was the source of their food; they also thought about controlling Magna Graecia so that they could threaten Sparta and the Peloponnese. They were allies of Egypt, helping it resist the invasion of the Persians...Athens wanted to establish a kingdom that controlled the entire Mediterranean!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This idea has basically not changed since Pericles to today's Athenian leaders.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It will inevitably conflict with the interests of our kingdom and eventually lead to war... This is what we expected.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, our army is still fighting Sparta in the Peloponnese. Athens chooses to attack at this time, which will add a lot of trouble to us."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Aristelas couldn't help but say something.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos did not respond directly, but asked: "In addition to Athens, which Greek city-states have joined this alliance now?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ellis has received the promise of the Olympian priests and Pisa and has decided to join this alliance; Corinth and Megara seem to feel the threat of our fleet and have clearly joined this alliance; Argos is still hesitant, mainly because Their people did not want to help the Spartans; the Phocians, influenced by the Delphic priests, also joined the alliance; after Phocians and Athens joined, the Locris followed; the&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thebans declared, We are their allies and have helped them in their most difficult time. They cannot break the oath they made to God and declare war on us, but they will not point their spears at the neighbors who have helped them, so they Remain neutral; influenced by Thebes, most of the city-states of the Boeotian League also chose neutrality;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   the Delphi priests and the Athenian envoys all went to lobby the Thessalians, and current intelligence shows that Jason is still hesitant , did not express a position; in addition, Athens also sent envoys to western Central Greece in an attempt to win over the indigenous people in Acarnania and Aetonia. There is no news yet about the specific situation... The general situation is probably like this.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After listening to Aristelas's more detailed introduction, Davos tapped the table with his hand and said thoughtfully: "Pelopidas of Thebes once quietly sent a letter stating to me that Thebes must not The reason for not making such a choice is that considering the current environment Thebes is in, they have already taken a lot of risks by making a neutral choice. I can understand this.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Athens has officially joined this alliance against us, which means that most of the Ionian city-states headed by Athens will declare war on us. Although Jason is still waiting and watching, I think since he has the ambition to become the overlord of Greece, he should Knowing that this is his only chance to repel our Theonia and achieve his goal, he will eventually join..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this point, his tone became extremely powerful: "These Greek city-states are against us It is also a good thing for them all to gather together and fight against us. We can save time, eradicate them all at once, and completely control the Greek mainland!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   , there was a kind look on his face: "The situation in Greece is becoming complicated now. This will be a good exercise for Clotokatax."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I believe that with the assistance of several senior generals such as Printors and Sekerian, the army he led in the Peloponnesus will not be in too much danger.&#13;
