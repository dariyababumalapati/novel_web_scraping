   Chapter 1194 Thessaly joins the war.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Asidamas thought for a while and said thoughtfully: "Since Theonia invaded Messenia, I took the time to investigate the situation in Messenia in detail, and found that this The Kingdom of the Mediterranean has actually controlled all the coastal forces in the Western Mediterranean and has become the well-deserved overlord of the Western Mediterranean! In the last two wars, this kingdom sent 100,000 troops and six to seven hundred warships to fight, and was able to maintain The strength of the offensive for more than half a year is amazing!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Moreover, Theonia developed from a small city-state to the current kingdom 20 years ago through constant wars and annexations. It cannot be just to help Thebes. , came to Greece to fight Sparta, its ultimate goal must be the entire Greece!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   My opinion is...either you send an envoy to Thurii and strive to form an alliance with Theonia to preserve the independence of Thessaly ; Either you go and call the Athenian envoy who is staying in the city and join the Greek Alliance, so that you can gather the power of all Greece and repel the Theonians!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this point, Asidamas's expression became solemn: " I prefer the former suggestion, because I don't think a makeshift alliance can defeat a kingdom that has become stronger through constant fighting." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Asidamas, you are always cautious." Jason suddenly said Stand up and said loudly: "I choose your latter suggestion! You are right, Theonia wants to conquer the whole of Greece. It is impossible for us to stay out of the matter and preserve our strength. The war will eventually burn to On the land of Thessaly. It is better to take this opportunity to gather the power of all Greece and fight with Theonia!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I think that during the Greco-Persian War, only half of the castles in Greece could defeat Persia. This time we, Thessaly, are joining us, but Theonia is not as powerful as Persia. Can't we still defeat them? Let's first unite with the city-states in the south, and after defeating Theonia with all our strength, we can join forces with Athens , Thebes, they compete for the hegemony of Greece, what do you think?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Asidamas looked at Jason who was a little excited, and was not surprised by the choice he made, because based on his respect for this Tagus He understood that it was almost impossible for Jason, who had always been enterprising and enterprising, to adopt a strategy of forbearance and concession, but he had to remind him: "If a coalition is formed, it must be prioritized, just like the Spartan War in the Greco-Persian War. As the leader of the alliance - "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, I, Thessaly, must be the leader and command all the coalition forces!" Jason said decisively, without concealing his ambition: "Sparta has declined, and the Athenian army No, although Thebes won the battle with Sparta, they did not have enough soldiers (he did not know that Thebes remained neutral)... Only I, Thessaly, can raise more than 40,000 troops, and The combat effectiveness is very strong, and the number of our fleet and warships is more than a hundred, surpassing that of Athens. If we don't become the leader of this alliance with strong troops and horses, who would dare to do so?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Becoming the leader of the Greek Alliance, although it is only temporary, but as long as Winning this battle will inevitably greatly improve Thessaly's status in the Greek city-states and make the people of Thessaly proud. You must know that in the past, the Thessalians were called "barbarians" among the people of Athens and Sparta. ", so not only Jason has this intention, but Asidamas is also optimistic about its success.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So, he suggested: "My lord, we can use this as a prerequisite for joining the alliance and negotiate with the Athenian envoy, but first invite him to review our army in Thessaly." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Asidamas, you and I again I thought of going together!" Jason clapped and smiled, with a confident look on his face: "I will gather my army right now, and in the afternoon you will take the Athenian envoy to the military camp outside the city."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166; &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the second day of the Battle of Tegea, Crotocathax led the army to repair near the sanctuary of Hercules in the southeast of Tegea city (formerly Sparta coalition camp), and at the same time sent 5,000 soldiers to escort tens of thousands of prisoners back to Messenia, most of whom were people from the city of Tegea. They will be sent back to Thurii, or become slaves of the public. Go mining, or be sold openly (Greek native slaves are still relatively popular in the Thurii slave market. First, they have high cultural quality, are smart, studious, and easy to communicate; second, they can satisfy colonial people like the Greek citizens of Theonia. The mentality of showing off to the mother country.).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As a result, the city of Tegea almost became an empty city, temporarily garrisoned by 1,000 Theonian soldiers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition, at the request of Tagetinos, the 3,000 soldiers of the Seventh Legion, who had suffered almost no losses, quickly moved south early in the morning to block the border between Tegea and Sparta and intercept the Spartan troops.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the afternoon, 2,000 soldiers and an envoy sent by Mantinia finally arrived at the new military camp of Theonia and eagerly expressed to Crotocatax that Mantinnia was willing to accept his suggestion and take over Theonia. Gaya.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, they also hope to enter into a secret agreement with Theonia, form a closer alliance, and fully support any military operations of Theonia in mainland Greece.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Mantinians are not fools. Although they covet the land of Tegea, they also know that they are weak. Once they make such a move, they will inevitably be squeezed and suppressed by other Greek city-states, and there may even be a war. Throughout the past, Theonia has always had a good reputation with its allies, so if they want to completely annex this land, they must hold on to Theonia's thighs.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, 500 of the 2,000 Mandinian soldiers are prepared to stay in Tegea City, and the remaining 1,500 are to obey the command of the Theonian army and participate in subsequent military operations to show the Mandinian people sincerity.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax's goal was achieved. He was very happy to discuss with the Mandinian envoys, and soon signed an agreement excluding the Arcadian alliance and limiting it to Theonia and Mandinia. secret military alliance.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, King Agesilaus of Sparta was still trudging through the mountains with the remaining army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before the battle, Agesilaus had been mentally prepared to lose the battle. He made two plans:&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   First, the Theonian army, like the Thebans, would retreat after winning the battle, then he could retreat first. After a brief reorganization at the camp, they led part of the army with Spartan warriors as the main force, and quietly retreated southward to the territory at night;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   second, the Theonian army took advantage of the victory to pursue it, forcing the defeated Spartan army into the mountains, from Judging from the past battles in Theonia, this possibility is very high, so he secretly informed the Spartan warriors who were familiar with the terrain that if this happened, they would meet in the Pelagos dense forest and then withdraw to the territory.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But he never expected that after the victory of the battle, the Theonian army pushed the defeated troops into the mountains through pursuit, and then separated some troops to continue the pursuit.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   These Theonian soldiers (actually the mountain reconnaissance brigade) ran in the mountains as if they were on the ground, and were good at hiding and sneak attacks, forcing the Spartan soldiers who were demoralized by the defeat to run away in the mountains, including Agassiz. Rouse himself, if it were not for the desperate rescue by the soldiers of the King's Guard, he almost fell into the hands of the Theonian soldiers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not long after, night fell, and it was difficult to find direction in the mountains, and they had to avoid wild beasts, so it was not until noon on the second day that the Spartan troops gradually gathered near the dense forest of Pelagos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   By the afternoon, there were less than a thousand soldiers gathered, and most of them were Pilians. After all, the Spartan soldiers fought on the first line during the battle, and later the entire right wing was attacked by the Theonian reserve force. It is undoubtedly much more difficult for the Spartan warriors in a semi-surrounded state to escape smoothly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What's more important is that Agesilaus did not see his son Archidamus appear, and he was unspeakably worried in his heart, but he knew that he could not wait any longer, otherwise the soldiers would not be able to return without food. To gain territory, one must first starve to death in the mountains.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So he resolutely gave the order to "go" and refused the guards' help. He hobbled at the front of the team with a cane.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Under his encouragement, the tired and hungry soldiers could only follow closely.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Due to their failure to retreat in time last night, during the day, they did not dare to march close to the Tegea Plain in their current situation. Otherwise, it would be a disaster if they were discovered by the Diorian scouts, so they could only march in the mountains. Trekking, this means that the time to return to hometown will be greatly extended...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;,&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotoka Tax who can't wait for the third day 2,000 soldiers were left to garrison the camp, and more than 2,000 wounded soldiers were treated and recuperated in the camp. 15,000 Theonian soldiers and 1,500 Mandinian soldiers were gathered and marched south.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not long after leaving the camp, he met the messenger sent by Tagetinos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The 1st Fleet has captured Sparta?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ...Klotokatax repeatedly read the battle report signed by Sekerian, his face full of surprise.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It turned out that after Tagetinos led 3,000 soldiers to the Spartan border yesterday, he did not capture many defeated soldiers. Later, after repeated requests from the eager legionnaires, he finally decided to send two companies into Sparta. Reach the territory and explore the reality.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There are continuous mountains between Tegea and the city of Sparta. The best road to take is a long and narrow channel formed by the Eurotas River Valley.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the Theonian army captured Messenia, Sparta has felt a great threat. At the suggestion of Agesilaus, the Spartans not only concentrated their efforts on building defense facilities on the southern coast, but also Small defensive camps were built in the dangerous terrain of the Eurotas Valley and the other two key passes in the north.&#13;
