   Chapter 1183 The Prince's Decision&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, the voice and smile of Adoris in the past kept reappearing in Croto Cartax's mind: "Clato, I really didn't expect that my father would send you to the Peloponnese, don't worry. , Brother, I will protect you with all my strength!...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Oh, by the way, this is your first time commanding an army, don't worry, I will fully support you...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotto, I am here to represent the entire army of soldiers. I would like to ask if there is any special plan for letting us build the camp without going to battle...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Croto, you finally gave us the order to go to battle. I will fight with all my strength to bring you the first victory... "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Brother!!..." Clotokatax cried heartbrokenly, and his tears couldn't stop flowing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a long time, he had to stop crying because the cremation of the remains of the fallen soldiers was to begin.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax watched with a dull expression as Adoris's body slowly burned in the blazing fire...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Only then did Ctissus have the opportunity to tell him sadly: "Your Highness, according to a A seriously injured soldier of the Third Battalion recalled that after Captain Adoris's unit square formation was breached by the Spartans, in order to save his soldiers, he was stabbed with spears in many places on his thighs and chest, and his whole body was covered in blood. Completely unable to stand... But even lying on the ground, he still wielded the dagger and continued to slash the enemy. Finally, the angry Spartan stabbed him with a spear..." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Spartan deserved to be cut into pieces with a thousand swords. Human!!" Clotokatax cursed with hatred through gritted teeth, clenching his fists tightly, his nails pricking his skin and not noticing the blood flowing out.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Highness, the heroic performance of Captain Adoris has not insulted the glory of the First Legion, nor has it insulted his glory as the prince of Theonia! He is the hero of the kingdom, and his soul will be punished by Hades. With your blessing, go to the Elysee Paradise!" Printors comforted softly from the side.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax silently stroked the helmet of Adoris as a relic, and after a long time he said sadly: "... How can I face my parents, my sister-in-law, and my nephew when I go back?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Printor Si and Ctissus were shocked and looked at each other. They both thought of a question at the same time: What would happen if King Davos knew the news of Adoris's death in battle?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the war, after learning that the First Legion suffered heavy casualties, Ctissus had been blaming himself. At this moment, he resolutely said in a deep voice: "Your Highness, the First Legion suffered heavy casualties and Captain Adoris died in battle... These are all mine. Responsibility! If I hadn't made a mistake in command, was too hesitant in issuing orders, and failed to prepare the soldiers in time, it would have been impossible -"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Clotokatax was grieved, his mind was still very clear. He waved his hand and said He ended his words: "Commander of the Ctisus Army, this is not your responsibility. If you want to blame it, it is the enemy who is too cunning and shameless! Lord Printors, we must not let go of the defeated Spartan troops who fled into the mountains. !"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax's words were full of hatred, and he looked like he would not give up until he wiped out all the enemies. This was completely opposite to the gentle attitude he had shown before. Printors understood that this was Ado. Reese's tragic death in battle gave the young prince a great stimulus. He did not give any reminder, but took advantage of the situation and said: "Your Highness, don't worry, we have captured the Spartan army's camp in the sanctuary of Heracles and captured With a large amount of baggage, Sparta defeated its troops and fled into the mountains. With no food to eat, the situation will only get worse. Tomorrow we will send troops quickly south to block Sparta's border, and we will easily capture them."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   " The plan to attack Sparta's territory cannot be delayed for too long!" Crotocathax said bitterly: "When will the army be able to complete its rest and recuperation?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Your Highness, it won't take long, we can send part of the army into Sparta the day after tomorrow. Bada territory." Printols said with certainty.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Part of the army? If we want to conquer Sparta, will we not have enough troops?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The Spartans are the ones who are short of troops now, not to mention we still have the fleet infantry of the First Fleet cooperating in the south."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay, then. Follow your suggestions." Crotokatax nodded and was about to say something more when he saw Muklu coming in a hurry: "Your Majesty Commander, Tegea has sent an envoy to ask to see you. ."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Tegea!" Clotokatax's face immediately sank, and his young face became a little twisted and ferocious because of resentment: "These shameless traitors still have the nerve to come to see me! We are here to save They came, but not only did they betray, but they also took advantage of our trust to launch a sneak attack on our army! The Tegeans were the culprits who caused heavy casualties in the First Legion and led to the death of my eldest brother in battle! I will never spare them! "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ctissus sympathizes with the anger of the young commander. Without the sneak attack from the rear by the Tegea army, it would just be a false defeat tactic by the Spartan army. He believes that with the combat effectiveness of the first legion, in an irregular formation, He would not suffer too much loss in this situation. It was precisely because he was attacked from the front and back that he had to let the soldiers of the First Legion switch to defense, so that he was completely in a passive state of being beaten.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, he also said angrily: "Commander, after the defeat of the Spartan coalition, the Tegea army was completely surrounded by us. Very few soldiers escaped. The number of captured soldiers alone was nearly 2,500. How about that?" All these captives were executed to commemorate the souls of the fallen soldiers, or they were all turned into slaves and sold.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I asked several Taegian captives, and the Taegian Council sent all the citizens in their city who could fight, obviously with vicious intentions. They wanted to completely destroy our army through this battle! But with the blessing of Hades, Tegea lost all its vitality and we could easily capture the city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Commander, we Dioni Asia's tradition has always been to treat friends sincerely, but not to be lenient towards betrayal! We can completely destroy this city, thereby shocking the whole of Greece, and making those city-states who want to be enemies with us consider the consequences!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   " Tisu's words were full of murderous intent. After hearing this, Crotokatax, who had been in grief and resentment, still showed some hesitation and subconsciously looked at Printors next to him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Printors did not express his suggestion directly, but talked about a past event calmly: "I remember that during the Western Mediterranean War, His Majesty led the army north to attack Rome. After capturing the city of Rome, he The Latin allies, who turned to attack Rome, met with strong resistance when they attacked Gabi. Not only did they suffer many casualties, but Gabi also joined forces with the Roman coalition to counter-encircle our siege troops.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the end, His Majesty led his army to defeat them and captured the city of Gabi, and then ordered all the Gabi people to be demoted as slaves. From then on, the Latium people felt fear, and wherever our army went, they opened the door one after another. surrender.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Commander Tagetinos led the Ninth Legion to capture Salos, he used the same method because of too many casualties. After that, the conquest of the entire island of Sardinia went much more smoothly... Although the&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   kingdom is powerful, it has Mainland Greece has little influence.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the contrary, many Greek city-states treat us like barbarians, which is why Tegea betrayed us so blatantly and Ellis turned from initial goodwill to hostility... On the one hand, while we express our goodwill to the Greek city-states, we also need to express our kindness to them. Properly demonstrating our powerful power will be more helpful for the kingdom to take root in mainland Greece in the future, so destroying the city of Tegea - I think it is a good choice!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Only then did Crotocartax suddenly remember that the commander who conquered Gabi City and carried out this cruel method was Printors. Of course he would not object to Ctissus's suggestion.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Croto Cartax frowned and fell into thought. After a while, he murmured: "If the Tegeans are cleared, shall we occupy this territory ourselves?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   If that happens, it will seriously affect our relationship with the Arcadian Alliance!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Printols blinked and said nothing. He had not thought about this issue because he felt that it should be a political and diplomatic matter and not something that a military staff officer should consider.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Fortunately, Ke Lotokatax did not ask any more questions, but continued to frown in thought. After a while, he said: "Go and call the Mantinian guide Calicenos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Calisenos came to the young commander, feeling very uneasy. As a bystander, he witnessed the entire battle process. Not only did he see the corpses of countless Spartan warriors lying in the fields, but also Seeing hundreds of prisoners being escorted by Theonian soldiers, including some Spartan warriors with long braids... This shocked him greatly. At the&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Battle of Leuctra, he I'm not at the scene, so I don't know what the situation is. But this time the Spartans have nearly 30,000 troops, and the full help of the Tegeans. It can be said that it is the most powerful force Sparta has had in the past few decades, but it is still It was defeated by the Theonian army from the front independently without the help of the Arcadian army. After&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   this battle, there is no doubt that Theonia will conquer Sparta, and the betrayal of the Tegeans continued. Putting the Arcadians as allies into an embarrassing and dangerous situation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sure enough, Crotoka Tax made him frightened as soon as he opened his mouth: "Theonia fulfilled the covenant and worked hard to rescue Tiger Ya, but suffered their betrayal, resulting in the death and injury of many of our soldiers... Taigea must pay the price for this!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   We have decided to immediately attack the city of Tegea. After capturing the city, we will touch all members of the Council and turn all the people in the city into slaves. From now on, there will be no Tegea people in this land!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
