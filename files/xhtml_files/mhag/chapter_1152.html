   Chapter 1152: Death and rebirth&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Agesilaus." Leoticides sneered and interrupted him: "Is this how you want to prevent me from leading an army to attack Sparta? It's too much. That's clumsy."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leotychides said, stood up and walked towards the Spartan king who was kneeling on the ground.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus looked up at his nephew, who was walking straight towards him with a frosty face and thunderous footsteps. There was no trace of panic on his face, but a little more joy: "The battle between Theonia and Sparta War, the Council of Elders will send special envoys to discuss the war. The reason why I am here is just because I just learned from Dolios that the famous general of Theonia, Proseus, is actually you! This is the blessing of Zeus! Over the years, wars have continued, and all the men in our family have died in battle. Now, apart from me, Archidamus is the only one left. Alas... the noble bloodline of the Aguidai family is about to be cut off!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And you also know that your brother has been growing up since he was a child. He is not steady enough in his work and is easy to trust others. He has not changed much until now. He does not have enough ability to bring Sparta out of the predicament today. And I have carefully understood your performance in Theonia, and your talents have gone far. Better than me, I hope&#226;&#128;&#148;"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   With a crisp "crack" sound, Leoticides pulled out the dagger from his waist and pressed it on Agesilaus' neck.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You said you were willing to use your life to compensate for your sins." Leoticides looked down at him, as if looking at a dead man, and said in a cold tone: "I hope you won't regret it." The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   sharpness of the dagger The reflected cold light pierced his eyes, and his body's instinctive heartbeat accelerated. Agesilaus tried his best to suppress the slightest fear in his heart, straightened his neck, closed his eyes, and said with an emphasis: "... back then it was I have done something wrong, and I want to atone for my sins to your mother and you! After my death, I hope you can return to Sparta. Before coming, I have discussed it with the censors and elders, and you will inherit what should have been yours. Your throne, I just hope that you can treat Archidamus well, he is your only - silk!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   With a muffled groan from Agesilaus gritted his teeth, his shoulder was cut open with a bloody dagger. The opening of the mouth immediately woke up the people who were watching the show silently on both sides. The military judge shouted urgently: "Lord Proseus, stop it! You can't kill the messenger!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides seemed to have not heard anything and said The dagger pressed hard on Agesilaus's wound.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus groaned in pain again, his whole body trembling.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Stop it!" the military judge shouted anxiously: "By killing him, you have violated military law! You have also seriously damaged the reputation of the kingdom! Hurry up! Go up and stop him!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just as the generals were about to rush forward, , Leotychides quickly retracted his dagger, and with a wave of his hand, a string of blood beads fell to the ground. He looked down at Agesilaus with contempt: "I thought you were really not afraid of death."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus collapsed. He fell to the ground, but secretly breathed a sigh of relief.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "There is nothing to talk about with the Spartans. Drive him out of the camp." Leoticides walked back to his seat and said calmly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course the people in the tent would not follow this order, otherwise if the old Spartan king died on the way, Theonia would really become the laughing stock of the Mediterranean countries, so Muklu immediately ordered the guards to carry Agesilaus rushed to the medical camp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Lord Proseus, I will report this matter to His Majesty truthfully." The military judge said with a serious expression.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides nodded calmly, then waved and said: "The meeting is over, let's all disperse."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even if all the generals who had watched a good show had their own thoughts in their hearts, they all wisely left quietly at this moment. Only the first Adoris, the captain of the first legion, said loudly: "Lord Proseus, you must not be tempted by the Spartans, abandon us and run back to Sparta!" If you want to put it aside&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   , column Oticides was too lazy to respond to such a stupid topic. Even though the speaker had a special identity, when he saw the people who were about to leave the tent suddenly slowed down and looked at him, he realized that he had to To make a statement: "Don't worry, I will be a citizen of Theonia until I die!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus's wound was carefully disinfected and bandaged, and he was observed for a while, and then he was escorted back after making sure that there was nothing serious. To the seaside pier.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition to the crew on his boat, there was also Archidamus who insisted on accompanying him. At this moment, he saw his father's upper body tied with white cloth and was in a depressed state. He quickly stepped forward to help him and asked angrily: "Father , are you injured?! Did the Theonians do it?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus glared at him and whispered: "I'm okay, let's go back quickly!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Agesilaus' tone He was weak, but he always told the truth at home, and Archidamus had to obey. After he helped his father sit down, he glared at the Theonian soldiers on the shore who were monitoring them, and said hatefully: "Shameless Theonians, this I remember your hatred, and one day I will repay you twice as much! - Set sail!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the boat sailed away from the dock, Agesilaus said: "The commander of the Theonians is indeed Leoti Chides, and I was slashed by his sword..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It turned out to be the hand of that bastard!" Archidamus gritted his teeth and said, "I said before that he hates our family so much, it's impossible. I will listen to your advice!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I still have something to gain by coming here this time." Agesilaus touched the bandage on his shoulder, recalled the previous situation, and said in deep thought: "Leotichides cut me this time. A sword is not heavy. Even because I am the Spartan envoy, I think what I said still had a certain effect on him... Also, when I saw him, the military tent happened to be full of Theonia. General, after listening to my words, I am afraid they will also have some thoughts about Leotychides... But the final effect depends on what happens next... If Leotychides can care about the old relationship... or He had conflicts with his men...or perhaps King Theonia was suspicious of him...As long as it can buy us more time, my mission today is worth it."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Archidamus looked at his father who was old and haggard .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   face, feeling ashamed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus did not notice the strangeness of his son. He stared at the coast and said with emotion: "What I hope most is that King Dionysus withdraws Leoticides. After all, he has a great influence on Sparta." The situation is too clear! And he has indeed changed a lot now..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus thought of the expressionless face, and subconsciously touched the bandage on his shoulder again: "He has always been calm, so I can't guess what he's thinking... No wonder he has so many victories in the past, if he were our opponent, it would be very troublesome!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Father." Archidamus said immediately dissatisfied: "Who is more powerful will not be known until we compete on the battlefield! When we recruit enough soldiers, the Theonians will know why we Spartans The reason why he has always been the overlord of Greece!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus knew very well that his son had always looked down on Leonticides when he was young, and often used the word "bastard" on his lips, so he said some words He didn't say it out loud: He really wanted Leotychides to return to Sparta, because Sparta's current talent pool was indeed withering, and it was not as good as Thebes and Athens. Leotychides, the head of the Onian family, could come back, and with his support, he might bring about some good changes...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But Leotychides' indifferent expression from beginning to end made him unpredictable. What are the chances that this wish will come true... He calmed down and said seriously: "I risked injury this time and got some benefits. The Theonians felt guilty and didn't do anything after the meeting. Then I covered my eyes with a cloth, so that I could observe some conditions in the Theonia camp...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I have long heard that the medical skills of the Theonia Kingdom are very high, but they actually built a large area in the military camp. The small clinic not only has many doctors, but also has a clean environment and complete equipment. My wound was quickly treated by them, and some of the treatment methods used were something I had never seen before. I feel now... Agesilaus&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   moved his injured arm: "I don't feel pain now. Instead, I feel a little cool, which is very good. Think about it, with such a military clinic as a guarantee, the injured Theonian soldiers suffered from wounds. The number of people who die from ulcers or become disabled will definitely be greatly reduced, and their morale will be maintained." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So after defeating the Theonian army, we must try our best to capture all the doctors of Theonia. Let us use it!" Archidamus took over, his face full of greed. As a Spartan warrior who has been fighting for many years, he certainly knows the benefits of having a group of doctors with superb medical skills.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus looked at him and continued: "I also saw countless Theonian soldiers digging trenches and building earthen fortresses around their camp, and they had already built a long section of earthen walls - &#226;&#128;&#148;"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The Theonians are strengthening their defenses. Are they preparing to occupy Messenia for a long time?!" Archidamus took a breath: "This may be an obstacle for us to regain Messenia. !"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "More importantly, the camps were built not only by Theonian soldiers, but also by many black laborers. They did not work under the threat of whips, and they seemed to get along with those Theonians. Harmony." Agesilaus said with a gloomy expression.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Archidamus's expression became solemn, but he also seemed a little suspicious: "Father, you mean that all the helots in Messenia have taken refuge in Theonia?! But it has only been a few days. !"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Those barbaric Italian natives can surrender to the Theonians, not to mention these stupid and meek Helots." Agesilaus said with some worry: "The Theonian army has Helots. With their help, our control over Messenia will be more powerful. When we fight with Messenia, the difficulties we encounter will increase, and these helots will also affect the stability of Sparta! "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
