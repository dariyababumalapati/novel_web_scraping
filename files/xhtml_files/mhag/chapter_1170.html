   Chapter 1170 Demonstration and Confrontation&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Both Sekerian and the Athenian naval admirals breathed a sigh of relief, but at the same time they were also more vigilant about the opponent's fleet. After all, so many warships were able to sail within a short period of time after receiving orders. It is not easy to stop the advance quickly, which means that this country's navy has a complete organizational command system and is well-trained.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a while, a fast ship sailed out from the Athenian ship array and headed straight towards the Theonian fleet. When it was approaching the Theonian warship, someone shouted on the boat: "The Athenian envoy wants to see the Theonian fleet." Fleet Commander!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Twenty minutes later, the Athenian envoy boarded the flagship of the Theonian First Fleet.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I am Sekerian, the commander of the first fleet of Theonia." Sekerian said loudly, while looking at the visitor: square face, high nose, thick eyebrows, big eyes, beard, wide forehead, medium build, neither fat nor thin , although his hair is a bit gray and he seems to be around 50 years old, he has a dignified appearance and appears to be particularly energetic.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The chief general of Athens, Callistratus!" The envoy looked at Sekerian sharply, his voice was rich and magnetic, but his words were sharp: "The 300,000 people in Athens entrusted me to ask the general, Dai Is Theonia going to declare war on Athens?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian didn't expect the other party to ask so directly, and hurriedly explained seriously: "You have misunderstood, Theonia has no ill intentions towards Athens! We are just chasing a group of soldiers. The Spartan fleet transporting grain had no choice but to come to this bay. In order to avoid misunderstandings, our warships also deliberately avoided the waters of Athens." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   No malice?" Callistratus sneered: " If our Athenian fleet sails in your Taranto Bay, will you Theonians think that this fleet comes with good intentions, and will you enthusiastically open the port of Thurii and invite them to enter?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seke ?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Li An was speechless for a moment. Before he could think of how to respond, he heard the other party continue: "I think you should be a Greek, so you should know that the survival of us Greeks mainly depends on trade. In the past few decades, Greek wars have continued. , I don't know how many naval battles occurred, but the sea trade of the city-states caught in the war continued, and few warships took the initiative to attack merchant ships, because the crew of every city-state knew that attacking merchant ships was digging up the roots of the Greeks! Corinth They are just doing what every maritime trade city-state should do, and those ships brewing for Sparta are just abiding by the trade contract. The crew members are just making some money for the livelihood of the family, but now they are being used by you... "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Calistratus's eloquent accusation made Sekerian feel a little aggrieved. He coughed quickly and interrupted impatiently: "Please stop talking about these irrelevant things. Tell me directly why you are here!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A trace of contempt flashed in Callistratus's eyes. He said calmly but forcefully: "After the war between Theonia and Sparta, Sparta once asked Athens Asking for help, the Athenian people did not agree to the Spartans' request considering their relationship with Thurii. I also hope that Theonia can take into account the previous friendly exchanges with Athens and not let the war spread to Athens, and promise to Your warships will not appear in the Aegean Sea again until the end of this war!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What Callistratus said was full of threats, but how could Sekerian be threatened? He raised his eyebrows, He said in a deep voice: "Our warships will leave soon, but if there are still fleets to transport troops and food to Sparta, we will come again!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The two sides broke up unhappy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Callistratus left by boat, a majestic bugle sounded in the Theonian fleet. The warships in the front of the Theonian fleet turned south one after another, and the warships in the rear turned north one after another. , and then began to move forward... Before long, the stacked ship formations once again formed two long columns, drawing a large circle in front of the waiting Athenian fleet, and then followed the original Entered route returns.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Athenian sailors listened to the passionate oar chants coming from the front, and watched the Theonian warships rotate flexibly one by one, so that the hull was facing the bow of the Athenian warship, and then swaggered from Driving in front of them... They were surprised by the boldness of the Theonians, and at the same time a little angry.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The Theonians are demonstrating against us!" Cabrias, the temporarily appointed commander of the Athenian fleet, looked at the sea ahead and said solemnly: "But the Theonian fleet has so many battles. With the ship, the formation can be changed so quickly. If we have a war with Theonia in the future, their navy will pose a huge threat to Athens!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this point, he turned to look at Callistra next to him. Tus, with a solemn expression and a low and powerful voice asked: "Now is a good time to defeat this fleet, do you want to launch an attack?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Callistratus shook his head: "Athens did not attack Dionysus Asia declared war, and the citizens were not prepared, so wait." It wasn't&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   until the entire fleet sailed out of Saron Bay that Sekerian loosened his clenched fists. He took a sharp breath and said loudly: "Order the fleet Sail eastward, pass through Kythnos, arrive near Delos, then go directly south until you see Crete, and then return to the station."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166; &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While the Theonian army was still building a camp in the territory of Megalopolis, Archidamus, who received the news, immediately lifted the siege of Mandinia. He led his army south, bypassing the city of Tegea, and began to build camps in the southern area bordering Sparta, and began to confront the Theonian army in the west.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After learning that the siege of Mantinia had been lifted, on the advice of Printors, Crotocatacus was not in a hurry to lead his army eastward, but patiently continued to let the soldiers consolidate the camp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the main forces of both sides remained stationary, there was no peace between the two camps. Fighting between the scouts from both sides occurred every day, including cavalry and reconnaissance infantry. Of course, the more professional and well-trained Dione The Asian side had the upper hand, especially when a small team from the Mountain Reconnaissance Brigade raided a food search team of about 20 people from the Spartan mercenaries, killing six people, killing four, and capturing two, without any casualties. The impressive record... these put a lot of pressure on the Spartan mercenaries.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A few days later, the Spartan king Agesilaus led 7,000 soldiers out of northern Sparta and entered the territory of Tegea to join the Spartan mercenaries.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Father, you are finally here!" Archidamus personally came out of the camp to greet him, and his face that had been covered in gloom for the past few days finally relaxed, revealing a smile.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Agesilaus was wearing a cane and looked a little tired, his smile was even brighter: "Thank you, Archidamus! In order to meet your request, I brought all the brave warriors of Sparta, Before leaving, I went to the Temple of Athena to make a sacrifice, and the oracle I got was a good omen! (Usually, the two kings of Sparta who had the right to sacrifice before the war would send people to Delphi to ask for the oracle, but now The war happened on the northern border. It was very dangerous to go to Delphi, and there was no time, so we could only worship in the acropolis of Sparta)" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   That's great!" Archidamus said Face relieved.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus looked around at the mercenary general standing behind Archidamus and said with confidence: "In fact, even if there is no oracle, I firmly believe that Sparta will win this time! Because in the past, we Sparta As long as Da sends a few hundred warriors and joins the coalition forces, he can dominate the Greek city! Now, not only do our Spartans have all the elites, but the army led by you, Archidamus, is also the most elite soldier from each city-state. Formed, the two combined together, this is the largest and most powerful army I have led over the years. I firmly believe that no one can match it!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Yes, King Agesilaus said it right. That's right!" The mercenary generals shouted excitedly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Archidamus then introduced these mercenary generals to his father one by one, and Agesilaus talked with them cordially. A few of them were people he knew. After all, he had fought in Asia Minor for many years 20 years ago. , is very familiar with the situation there, so he knows the home state of each mercenary general well, and talks about it in detail, making the generals feel cordial.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   For such mercenary generals, Agesilaus is a living legend. He fought alone in the Persian territories, which actually kept the Persians in an embarrassing situation of being passively beaten. He took the initiative to seek peace several times. Moreover, his charm made many Greek city-states in Asia Minor willing to provide continuous support. Many of his stories are still circulated in Asia Minor to this day.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, the mercenary generals rushed to salute Agesilaus and were proud to talk to him. The atmosphere was very warm for a while.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a long time, Agesilaus said goodbye to them on the grounds that he was "somewhat tired and needed a rest" and followed Archidamus into the central tent.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Entering the tent, Agesilaus threw away the wooden stick, and with the support of his slaves, he slumped down on a wooden chair. The smile on his face disappeared and his expression became serious: "What is the situation now?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Father." Archidamus's expression was equally serious: "A small amount of food was shipped from the port of Corinth the day before yesterday, but yesterday no more food was shipped from the north! The Persians told me that the Theonian fleet was shipped every day When cruising in the Aegean Sea, any grain-carrying fleet entering the Saron Gulf would be intercepted and interrogated. They had already captured several fleets, and the Persians had to temporarily stop transporting grain." (&#13;
