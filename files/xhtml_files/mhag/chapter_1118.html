   Chapter 1118 The Youngest Commander&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As the administrator of the region, Asistes was not surprised. He pondered and said: "If all the allies provide full support, there will be about 50,000 to 60,000 people, even half of them. Between twenty and thirty thousand people, plus our own army, I think it is possible to defeat the invading Gauls with only the strength of the Roman region. This is why His Majesty founded Theonia in central Italy. The goal that the alliance hopes to achieve."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Having said this, Asistes looked at the young legion commander in front of him and said solemnly: "Of course, Mr. Patroclus, you are now in the Roman region. Supreme military commander, you make the military decisions." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I also think that the strength of the Roman region alone is enough to fight against the invading Gauls!" Patroclus said very confidently: "However, gathering such a large force For the army to operate, Master Asistes also needs to provide sufficient logistical support and weapons reserves." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   You can rest assured that I will do my best to ensure the army's operation." When Asistes saw the young army commander, he not only Agreeing with his opinion, and with strong fighting spirit and joy in his heart, he immediately promised: "Moreover, just now I have sent a messenger to Thurii to inform His Majesty of the 'Large-scale invasion of Gauls'. I believe it will not be long before" After that, the kingdom will concentrate more manpower and material resources to deal with this Gauls' invasion, so you don't have to worry at all. First, lead the army to prevent the Gauls from invading our territory, and then think of ways to repel them... "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the next few days, the allied armies of the Holy Kingdom of Theonia near Rome arrived one after another. The first to arrive in Rome were the Latin allied armies, because They were the closest to Rome, and they were also tortured by the Gauls back then, so they sent more than 10,000 troops.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This makes Patroclus very happy, because in recent years, Theonia has used towns such as Rome and Viai to have closer and closer relations with the neighboring Latin allies through trade, transportation and other means. In fact, in During the military training of the Fourteenth Legion, he would also ask citizens of the Latin Confederacy to join from time to time, and this was implemented. Therefore, among the allies near Rome, the Latin Confederate army was the most familiar with Theonian military tactics, and their soldiers Forming the majority among the Allied forces made it easier for Patroclus to command the battle.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Next arrived were the Volscians and Herniki, who showed great enthusiasm, but due to heavy losses in the previous war, their population was unlikely to change in just a few years, so fewer than 5,000 soldiers were sent. people.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then came the Sabine army and the Aequi...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Etruscan allies did not send troops, but seized the time to allow the people in the territory to withdraw into the city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While strengthening the city's defense, they also sent messengers to Rome every day, urging Theonia to go north for reinforcements as soon as possible.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although within a few days, 30,000 Theonian soldiers from the Roman area had gathered in the Roman military camp, and the Latin Allies, the Volscian Allies, the Herniki Allies... joined one after another, the total The number of troops exceeded 50,000, but Patroclus still stood still.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, Asistes could not sit still and hurried to the military camp: "Captain Patroclus, now there is news from the north that the Gauls have crossed the border defense line we established. Hasdrubal The situation of the border legion led by the Lord is unknown. However, the Gauls quickly captured Florentia, and then moved south in a large scale, launching attacks on Felanora (felathri) and fufluna (fufluna). Randomly plundering villages and towns along the way, killing Etruscan people... The envoys of the Etruscan allies block the door of the regional administrative office every day. If you don't send troops to go north, I'm afraid the Etruscan envoys will come en masse Thurii, you have filed a complaint against us to Your Majesty!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It seems that Asistes was a little resentful towards Patroclus, and even the respectful title "Sir" was omitted.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But after hearing this, Patroclus seemed calm. He said calmly: "Lord Asistes, judging from the current situation, the Etruscans' fear of the Gauls has deepened. Marrow, they have been completely panicked and lost their normal reason and judgment.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, as the main force resisting the Gauls, we Theonia must remain calm enough, analyze the current chaotic battle situation, and find good enough fighter opportunities Attack again instead of heading north hastily to engage the Gauls. Otherwise, once the attack is frustrated, it will undoubtedly greatly dampen our morale and affect the stability of Rome..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Asistes was a mercenary after all. In the early years, I followed Davos to fight in Persia. It's not that I don't understand military affairs, but I have been engaged in government affairs for the past 20 years. In addition, during this time, bad news continued to come from the front, as well as the constant harassment from Etruscan envoys. With the heavy responsibility of the entire region on his shoulders, he inevitably got angry. At this time, after being reminded by Patroclus, he came to his senses.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But Patroclus's words contained a lesson. As a dignified regional administrator and important minister of the kingdom, Asistes was a little embarrassed. If it were someone else, he might have to yell a few more words to save some face, but on the other side The person sitting was the son-in-law of His Majesty King Davos, who was highly regarded by him, so Asistes could only suppress his dissatisfaction. After a while, he finally said in a low voice: "What are your plans?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Sir!" Patroclus saw that Asistes was a little angry, but he didn't care too much. Although Asistes was a higher-ranking official, the Fourteenth Legion was not under the jurisdiction of the regional administrator. , and Patroclus was reminded by his wife Cynthia before taking office that he had always deliberately avoided being too close to Asistes, but considering that Asistes was following His Majesty when Theonia was established, A confidant with high qualifications, he still softened his tone: "Although there is no specific news, I don't think the Gauls can capture the Florentia military camp and the military base in just a few days. Lord Hastrubal is still holding on to the Lucca military camp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   If the city of Florentisa can conscientiously implement the defensive measures we have formulated for it before, it is impossible for the Gauls to break through its city. It is a pity that this Under the protection of our border legions for more than a year, they lost their vigilance. After receiving the warning, they were still slowly opening the city gates to take in the fleeing people. But when the Gauls bypassed the military camp and quickly Marching towards Florentia, and rushed to the city in a short time to launch the attack, they panicked and did not close the city gate immediately, causing the Gauls to follow the refugees and rush into the city..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Patroclus told the true reason for the fall of Florentia, he sighed again and said regretfully: "The Gauls occupied Florentia, and they had the Etruscan empire." We have a foothold in Leia and have a relatively sufficient supply of military rations. According to the information currently obtained, we know that there are about 40,000 Gauls, and their morale is high. If I lead the army across Taiwan at this time, He rushed to the north of Etruria to fight with him. Even if he could win, he would definitely suffer heavy losses. It would be better not to go north to avoid arousing the vigilance of the Gauls, and at the same time wait for the subsequent allied forces to join together, and More material reserves..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You don't have to worry about military supplies. Crotokatax has been working hard to prepare!" Asistes reminded in a serious tone: "But just letting the army stay in the barracks and wait for so long is not the answer. Having repeatedly allowed the Gauls to conquer other Etruscan city-states, I'm afraid it will be difficult for us to account for our Etruscan allies and other allies!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Fourteenth Legion is only responsible to Your Majesty and the Kingdom! Patroclus replied calmly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Asistes heard this, he was a little angry: "But you are now the commander of the entire northern Theonian coalition! Protecting the Etruscan allies is the responsibility entrusted to you by His Majesty!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Yes." Troclus said seriously: "That's why I have to be cautious and wait hard for the opportunity! Master Asistes, don't be anxious. All it takes is a big victory, and any accusations and resentments will disappear.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   " Sisters saw that he was so stubborn that he was so angry that he said: "Okay, then I will wait for your victory!" and then left with a puff of sleeves.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Back in the administrative hall, when Crotocatacus reported his work to him, Asistes still talked about the matter with resentment, and said angrily: "When dealing with Patroclus in normal times, I feel that he He is still a very talkative person, but why has he become so stubborn and unable to listen to suggestions at such a critical moment? He is in charge of the entire northern coalition of Theonia, and I am really worried!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotokata After hearing this, Kes comforted him and said: "Sir, you govern this huge area of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;Rome, and at the same time you have to take care of the friendly relations with the surrounding allies. You have such a heavy responsibility. Now that you have been invaded by the Gauls, you have threatened the entire central region. The safety of the people is likely to destroy the stable order that you have worked so hard to establish here over the past few years. I have seen that you have not slept well during this period, which shows how much pressure you are facing!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As the commander of the regiment , Patroclus looks young, but it is not because he is my brother-in-law. My father made him the commander of the Fourteenth Legion, giving him the ability to command the coalition forces and resist the Gauls in a state of emergency. right, but because he is one of the most outstanding candidates among the younger generation of generals in the Theonian army. His father, who has always been good at employing people, placed him here. He must have thought that he had the ability and could take on this important task.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact , he was good at employing people.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The pressure he faced was also great. Every time I delivered supplies to the military camp and went to see him, he was either assigning tasks to other generals, listening to reports from sentinels, or looking at the map intently by himself. He had no time at all. Tell me a little more.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   If you think about it, you can understand that the Roman area is the northernmost territory of the kingdom. Reinforcements are unlikely to arrive in a short time. The coalition led by Patroclus is the only force to resist the Gauls at this time. , if he led his army to suffer a defeat in the battle with the Gauls, the Gauls might take the opportunity to rush into the Roman area... So he is cautious, I think it is understandable..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
