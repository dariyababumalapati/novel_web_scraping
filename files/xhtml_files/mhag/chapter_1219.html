   Chapter 1219 Jason's Return&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   According to Greek tradition, after a battle, the defeated party can also send people to clean the battlefield and take away the compatriots who died in the battle in order to give them a decent burial.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the past, Theonia rarely fulfilled this tradition, because they were the victors most of the time, and in order to expand the results, they were good at continuing to pursue after the victory. The opponent was afraid of not being able to escape, so there was no way to think about other things.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Only during this period of time did the Theonian army defend against the attack of the Greek coalition forces, and this Greek military tradition could be well fulfilled.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Tens of thousands of physically and mentally exhausted Greek coalition soldiers began to slowly retreat toward Leprion's camp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leprion is less than 20 miles away from the northern border of Messenia. This small city located in the southern part of the Elis region was originally attached to Elis, but was later taken away by Sparta. After Elis joined the Greek League, it became confident again to take it back.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the Greek coalition forces were frequently harassed by Theonian soldiers when they attacked the Lagnia area, after moving their troops to attack Messenia, Iphicrates learned his lesson and stationed his army in Leprion, who was far away from the battlefield, was mainly for safety.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the way back to the camp, many generals from other city-states came to complain to Iphicrates, saying, "Their soldiers suffered a lot of casualties in today's battle..." and so on. The outsiders expressed similar thoughts, they were unwilling to engage in such a brutal siege battle again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, after suffering losses in the attack on the northern part of the Lagnia region, the city-state armies had some scruples about attacking the Theonia defense camp. If it were not for the fact that they captured a Theonia camp some time ago, they were re-energized. Confidence, and today Iphicrates put most of the Athenian army into battle first as an example, and also issued an order for a full-scale attack. The armies of other city-states would not fight so hard.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But it turns out that the small victory a few days ago was just an illusion. The defense of the Theonians has not weakened, but has strengthened. Although the siege capabilities of the Greek coalition have improved somewhat (they continue to attack Dion A lot of experience was learned from the battle in the Theonia camp), but it was still not enough to break through the complex camp defense system of the Theonia army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Regarding the cryptic expressions of these generals, Iphicrates gave the same reply: The coalition forces will no longer storm the Theonia defense camp!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Iphicrates's affirmative answer surprised the generals, but the commander-in-chief of the coalition did not say another word.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Returning to the military tent in the Leprion camp, Iphicrates had just taken off his armor when the guards outside the tent came in and reported: "General, General Jason wants to see you."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Ask him to come in quickly."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Jason Striding into the military tent, Iphicrates said bluntly before he could speak: "I heard that you announced that you would give up attacking the Theonian camp in Messenia. Is this true?! "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Looking at Jason who looked like he was raising an army to accuse him, Iphicrates said calmly: "General Jason, I was about to send someone to find you, but I didn't expect you to come first. That's right, I meant I have said this, but -" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is a stupid decision!" Jason looked directly at him and said firmly: "We can't give up the attack just because today's losses are large. We have suffered heavy casualties, Dai The Onians are not much better. Before you withdrew, my soldiers had already attacked the wooden wall several times. Although they were finally driven down by the enemy, this shows that our attack is effective! As long as the next few days If we maintain such an offensive intensity, we will definitely be able to break through the Theonian defense line!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this point, Jason showed a fierce look: "Don't listen to the various excuses of those city-state generals, you should be like today Continue to issue orders to attack like this! If you really want to stop attacking the Theonia camp, then I'm sorry, I will no longer participate in your war with Theonia and lead the army back to Thessaly!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Facing Ia Song's threat, Iphicrates blinked and showed a helpless smile: "Dear General Jason, of course I know that as long as I continue to attack, I will definitely break through the Theonia camp, but the reason why I made Such a decision was not made because of worries about excessive casualties, but because -"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Iphicrates paused and said in an emphasis: "I just received a message from Athens. Four days ago, the Theonian Navy The sudden blockade of Salon Bay prevented our warships from leaving the port, but the fishermen on our north coast still discovered an unusual situation. A large number of Theonian ships carried soldiers around Euboea Island and entered the Gulf of Mariakos. ..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The Theonians are going to raid my Thessaly!" Jason's expression suddenly changed, and he glared at Iphicrates: "Why didn't you tell me such important news earlier?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   " In such a large-scale war, any decision must be made carefully. After my Athens council got the news, they tried their best to find out the truth. For this reason, they also lost many ships, and finally determined the Theonian army. After they did land in Thessaly, the General Executive Committee urgently sent messengers on fast horses to come here day and night-" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   How many people were in the Theonian army who landed in Thessaly?!" Jason said nothing. Interrupting him politely, he asked eagerly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "According to our judgment, it will not be less than 30,000 people."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Jason strode out of the military tent with an anxious look on his face without saying a word.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Iphicrates also hurriedly called his adjutant: "Hurry up and send people to inform the generals of each city-state, saying...'Since traces of the Theonian army were found in Thessaly, the Thessaly army must rush Go back to the rescue and tell them not to be nervous and to control their soldiers..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The adjutant also felt nervous after hearing this and said quickly: "I will do it right away."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "And -" Iphicrates said solemnly : "Go to the Thessaly military camp in person and tell Jason that I suggest that he lead his army directly north, pass through the Ellis area, and cross the Corinth Gulf by boat from the port of Patras or Cape Rhion... ...Taking this route will save a lot of time."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As he spoke, he took out a few more letters from his arms: "These are the letters I wrote to Ellis, Patras, and Cape Rhion in the name of Athens. , I hope they can help the Thessalians. Give these letters to Jason."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After sending away the adjutant, Iphicrates also walked out of the military tent, looking at Thessalians through the still thin night. In the direction of the Li military camp, there was a complete explosion of horses neighing and people shouting.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, Iphicrates lied to Jason. The letter from the Athenian General Executive Committee to him not only asked him to increase his attack on Theonia, but also strictly ordered him to conceal the news from the Thessalians. , only Callistratus, who had a good relationship with him, wrote to him in another letter, tactfully mentioning that he can make decisions that are in the best interest of Athens based on the situation on the battlefield.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During the confrontation and battle with the Theonian army, Iphicrates has realized that the Theonian army has strong capabilities in defensive operations, while the city-state armies of the Greek Alliance obviously have not experienced After such an intense siege battle, they did not dare to withstand too many casualties, so they always worked but did not put in much effort in previous siege battles, including the Athenian army itself.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After receiving the order from Athens, Iphicrates finally issued a death order today and launched a storming attack. However, the result was still disappointing. Not only did he fail to defeat the enemy, but the sharp increase in the number of casualties not only caused the allied generals to fight. He retreated, which made him feel frightened.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   If, as Jason said, he continues to launch a strong attack, I am afraid that the Greek coalition forces will be torn apart before the defense line of Theonia is broken, and he himself may be impeached by the Athens Citizens' Assembly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What's more, even if the Greek coalition forces paid a heavy price and finally defeated the Theonian army in Messenia, the Theonian Kingdom would still send new troops to Greece, just like they sent another army to land in Messenia. The Greek coalition forces, which had already suffered heavy losses by then, would have no choice but to use them to resist their invasion!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Iphicrates has realized that the war with Theonia cannot be ended by winning one or two battles. If he wants to confront the powerful Theonia army for a long time, he must win over Sessa. Benefit people.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During the period of fighting side by side, Iphicrates discovered that the Thessalian army not only accounted for half of the Greek coalition forces, but also had the strongest combat effectiveness among the coalition forces, especially the nearly 10,000 mercenaries who not only fought bravely, And very disciplined.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As the commander-in-chief of the Thessalian army, Jason had some conflicts with Iphicrates because he failed to become the commander-in-chief of the Greek coalition forces, but he treated every battle seriously and focused, and his commanding ability was also very strong.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As an enemy, Thessaly's army is undoubtedly terrifying, but as an ally against a powerful enemy, Thessaly's army is undoubtedly the best help. That's why Iphicrates decided to disobey the order of the General's Executive Committee and delay After a day, he personally told Jason the news that "Thessaly was attacked by the Theonian army". Even if the general executive committee asked about the matter in the future, he could pretend that "Jason got Thessaly". "In any case, it is impossible for Athens to completely block all roads from Thessaly to the Peloponnese."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, he was still prepared to send his trusted servants back to Athens and quietly revealed the matter to his friend Callistratus. He believed that Callistratus would definitely support him because of his foresight. All for Athens!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just as Iphicrates was standing outside the tent thinking about it, his adjutant had rushed back to report to him: "General, I have given the letter to Jason. He expressed his thanks to you and said that he would wait for a while. After he has driven away the Theonian army in Thessaly and stabilized the rear, he will definitely lead his army back to fight against the Theonians with the Greek coalition forces..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
