   Chapter 1164 In Megalopolis&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, a shocking news came: a large Spartan army entered the Arcadia region from the north!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The councilors of the city-states of the Arcadian League were shocked, especially the Mantinians led by Lycomedes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Isn't Sparta located southeast of Arcadia? Why would its army appear in the north?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It turned out that Sparta had used the gold and silver provided by Persia to hire many soldiers in Northern Greece, Ionia and Asia Minor. Persia also provided ships to transport them to Greece, but they did not land on the coast of Sparta. , because it had been blockaded by the Theonian fleet, but with the acquiescence of Athens and Corinth, it entered the Saron Gulf to the east of the isthmus and entered the harbor of Corinth.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the mercenaries were assembled ashore, they were led south by Archidamus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Lycomedes was anxious because Mantinia was located in the northeast of the Arcadian region and was on the path that the Spartan army must pass through, and as an advocate of the Arcadian Alliance, Mantinia It was a thorn in the side and a thorn in the flesh of the Spartans.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Lycomedes loudly shouted in the alliance: "The army formed by the Spartans with the help of Persia entered the territory of Arcadia without permission. They were by no means for peace. They came to destroy what Sparta regarded as For the threatening Arcadian Alliance, they will re-enslave the Arcadians to fight for the interests of Sparta! If the Arcadian Alliance does not form an alliance with Theonia as soon as possible, let the Theonia army To stop the ferocious Spartan mercenary army, the alliance will soon perish, and all those who support the establishment of the alliance will become victims of Spartan sticks!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Lycomedes' words made the MPs Moved, they then received news: the Spartan army soldiers who invaded Arcadia wreaked havoc and ravaged the land of Frios.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Finally, the Arcadian Alliance passed the agreement with a slight advantage.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the early spring of 370 BC (the twenty-fourth year of the Kingdom of Theonia), the Arcadian Alliance and Theonia formed an alliance, and then Crotokatax led the first, fourth, and sixth legions. , the Mountain Reconnaissance Group, the 1st Cavalry Corps, and half of the 7th Corps (3,000 soldiers stationed in Messenia), a total of about 32,000 soldiers marched north and entered the Arcadian region.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, the Spartan mercenaries led by Archidamus were already attacking Mandinia, and the Spartan Council of Elders had learned about the "Arcadian League" from the pro-Spartan faction among their northern neighbors. "will form an alliance with Theonia", they hated the leader of the alliance, Mantinnia. Since the timely arrival of the mercenary army boosted their confidence, they decided to hit Mantinia first and frighten the Arcadian Alliance. Forcing it to fall back to Sparta.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The reason why the Spartans dared to make such a decision was that this army, which was formed at a huge cost, had 8,000 heavy infantry, mainly hired from Miletus, Ephesus, Samos, Chios, and Lesbos. , Aeoria and other Greek city-states belonging to the western coastal areas of Asia Minor in Persia; 4,500 Thracian peltasts, mainly employed from various Thracian states located north of the Kingdom of Macedonia, close to the Aegean Sea, and near the Rhodope Mountains tribe; 1,500 cavalry mainly hired from the Kingdom of Macedonia; 1,200 archers and slingers from Crete and Rhodes, in addition to more than 4,000 light armored soldiers from the Ionian islands in the Aegean Sea...a total of More than 20,000 soldiers need to pay at least 10,000 Dalek gold coins every month and consume countless amounts of food. Of course, these are all provided by the Persians.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Archidamus led such a large and well-equipped army for the first time, and he was confident that he would capture Mandinia in a short time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But when he led his army into the territory of Mandinia, all the people of Mandinia had already taken refuge in the city, so Archidamus began to attack the city of Mandinia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He originally thought that with the superior force he had, he should be able to capture the city of Mantinnia quickly, but unexpectedly he hit a hard nail.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The former city of Mantinia was destroyed by Spartan floods. After the Mantinians, who had been in exile for many years, returned home, they would never let their city be captured by the Spartans again, so they attacked the new city. Ingenious design.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Mandinians chose a high-lying place on the Orpheus River as the site for building the city, and then dug a new river channel nearby to split the Orpheus River into two upstream of the city site and bypass the new city site. , meeting downstream, the river that was originally a huge threat has been transformed into a natural moat for the city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   They also laid a solid stone foundation for the entire city, and the city walls were all made of bricks. However, the city walls were not complete and continuous, because the entire city was divided into 10 separate parts, and the walls of each part were connected to the other parts. They are not connected, but they overlap with each other. There are gates in these overlapping places, so the new city of Mantinha has 10 gates.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   For such a unique and irregular city, the Spartan army had to capture each city district one by one to completely occupy the entire city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Mantinian city walls are independent according to the height of the terrain, which not only prevents the Spartans from fully deploying their superior forces, but also exposes the siege soldiers to long-range attacks from multiple sides of the defending side, not to mention the There is a river Orpheus as a barrier.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Archidamus launched several attacks on the city of Mantinea using traditional Greek siege methods. Not only did he fail to make any progress, but he also suffered some casualties, forcing him to change the attack to a siege and send a messenger back to the city. Bada reports on the war situation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, Crotocatacus has led his army into southwestern Arcadia. This area is a rare hilly area in Arcadia. The Helison River runs through the entire area from south to north.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Among the mountains in the east-central part is Lycaon, the main sacred mountain where the Arcadians held religious sacrificial ceremonies, and Megalopolis, the newly built central town of the Arcadian Alliance, is located on the Helison River. between the east coast and the sacred mountain of Lycaen.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Due to the outbreak of the war with the Spartans, the construction of the new city of Megalopolis has been stopped. The city wall as the outline of the city is only half-built, and the Temple of Zeus, which is most important to the Arcadians, has only been erected for more than a dozen years. A colonnade... Scaffolding and stones piled all over the city can be seen everywhere in the city. There is only one building that, although simple, has been completed long ago, and that is the Arcadian Alliance's meeting hall. It is the foundation for the existence of the entire alliance. The three members elected by the people of the city-state have lived here for a long time, and in accordance with the rules set by the alliance, they jointly discuss and decide on foreign and military affairs within the alliance.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, dozens of members of the alliance walked out of the city of Megalopolis, standing on a high place and looking south: I saw countless Theonian soldiers in the distance wearing uniform and sophisticated armor and weapons, arranged neatly. The column crossed the pontoon bridge they quickly built on the Helison River. Although the footsteps and the clash of armor were quite noisy, and the dust and fog were flying, few people complained loudly. The entire army was like a silent black dragon, Swimming forward non-stop...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Arcadian councilors stood and looked at it for a long time. They could neither see the head nor the tail of this long dragon, and they felt a little shocked.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, the long dragon branched off again and headed straight north.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When they were about to approach them, the young general riding a tall horse and wearing a golden crown at the front raised his right hand and waved it down again. Then the army behind him stopped advancing in an instant, and the soldiers stood silently... This scene once again made people sad. MPs were surprised.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Lycomedes immediately descended from the heights to greet him, followed closely by the other councilors.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax also dismounted and led Printoles, Muklu and the palace guards forward to meet him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "General Clotokatax, thank you very much for your timely assistance!" Lycomedes solemnly bowed and saluted Prince Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax quickly supported him and said sincerely: "Lord Lycomedes, now that the Arcadian Alliance and Theonia are allies, this is what we should do! Please rest assured , according to Theonia's military law, our soldiers will not do anything on the land of our allies to damage the friendship between the two peoples! If there are soldiers who violate it, they will be severely punished!" As soon as these words&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   came out, no The Arcadian councilors breathed a sigh of relief.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Suddenly, someone among the congressmen asked loudly: "How many soldiers have you sent?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Printors took over: "Considering that Arcadia has many mountains and it is difficult to deploy troops, we only brought more than 30,000 soldiers. Soldiers, there are still more than 10,000 garrisoned in Messenia (Printors counted Messenians and the fleet infantry of the First Fleet).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Most of the MPs gasped Angry, he immediately let out a sigh: more than 40,000 soldiers with complete equipment! They have never seen such a huge army in their lives! No wonder Theonia's marching troops were so long that the head and tail could not be seen at all. !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   You must know that the last time such a large number of troops appeared in mainland Greece was during the Greco-Persian War a hundred years ago. More than 100,000 soldiers from various Greek city-states (heavy infantry accounted for two-fifths of the total number) were gathered in Platia. A decisive battle with the Persians; the other one was the Peloponnesian War decades ago. It is said that Athens sent an army of about 30,000 people to expedition to Syracuse in Sicily, and suffered a disastrous defeat in the end.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But these two times have passed over time. Far away, none of them had seen it with their own eyes. The only thing a few MPs had personally experienced was the Battle of Leuctra that happened not long ago. The Peloponnesian coalition led by Sparta had more than 10,000 people, and the two warring parties totaled about 20,000 people. , in their eyes, it is already a grand battle.&#13;
