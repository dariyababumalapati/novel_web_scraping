   Davos was listening carefully and was happy for it. Suddenly he saw Mariji kneeling down with a plop and said with a guilty look on his face: "Your Majesty...actually I am Babylon Just to make myself...appear noble, I kept calling myself a Persian. Later I wanted to confess, but I felt that if the people of the kingdom knew that I had lied, it would damage the majesty of the Ministry of Commerce and be detrimental to the execution of government orders. , so... please forgive me for the sins I have concealed for a long time!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos laughed, stretched out his hand to pull him up, and said loudly: "You are not Persian, this is great! I was worried about beating Persia to death. The defeat and the disastrous defeat of Persia will cause some harm to you. Now I am relieved! After the decisive battle with the Persian army, I will appoint you as the envoy of Theonia to persuade your compatriots to surrender to the kingdom. Let's share the fruits of victory together!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Thank you, Your Majesty!" Marij bowed deeply to Davos with a look of joy on his face.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The next day King Davos held a military meeting. Not only did he require generals above the legion commander to attend, but he also invited Retired former mercenary veterans such as Alexis, Philisius, Thormids, Amyntas, and Epithenes attended the meeting. After listening to Izam's detailed report on the Persian army, they discussed together Should we change the current defensive posture and launch an attack on the Persian army?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ,&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Almost at the same time, the Persian King Artaxerxes also held a military meeting in the city of Taposaku. Although his army had more troops than Theonia, there were only a few participants: the Persian King's The confidant Trebassus, the governor Harpurgus from the Susa region, and the general Mardonius from Persepolis (both of them were the disciples of Darius, the great king who rebuilt Persia). Descendants of 6 allies, extremely distinguished), as well as Orontas, the governor of Armenia, who was also the son-in-law of the King of Persia, and Tyrtaeus, a young general who led the undead army, also distinguished, he was born in A Although the Chemenid royal family is a distant branch, they married a daughter of Artaxerxes and were close to the king of Persia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The last one is the royal spy chief Marktonos. At this moment, he is speaking loudly about the intelligence about the Theonian army: "...from the turmoil in Egypt last September and the Theonian troops landing in Egypt one after another, to this year In January of that year, the king of Theonia arrived in Egypt, and then they invaded Canaan, captured Phoenicia, and occupied Syria. During this period, the flags of the so-called "Theonia Legion" that we could detect were... &#226;&#128;&#166;first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, tenth 7. The 18th, 19th (Po River area, mainly Gauls), 21st Legion (Africa area, mainly Phoenicians and Numibians)... According to Dio Calculated with a fixed combat strength of 8,000 for each legion in Theonia, the total number is 144,000.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition, the flags of five Theonia cavalry regiments also appeared in the Theonia army, with a number of more than 10,000... ...The total number of this army led by the King of Theonia himself exceeds 150,000, which is consistent with the judgment of the total number of Theonia troops made by our spies who have been observing the Theonia army in Syria for a long time. Consistent..." Marktonos talked eloquently, and was familiar with the situation of the Theonian army. He was able to obtain such accurate information thanks to the department he was responsible for - the Persian Royal Secret Service.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Cyrus founded Persia, but Darius made Persia truly an empire. He perfected the Persian political system, established a complete administrative and bureaucratic hierarchy, reformed the Persian financial and monetary system, and established Ahura As the leader of people's faith, Mazda also established a huge road system within the country, making communication between the center and the regions more convenient... Of course, Persia has such a vast territory, and even some areas are autonomous. , in order to rule the subjects more effectively and prevent the recurrence of the great rebellion during the Cambyses period, it is necessary to have a more detailed and accurate grasp of the situation of officials and people in various places so that they can respond in time. Therefore, Darius established a specialized The royal secret agency serving the king, which preceded the Intelligence Department of the Kingdom of Theonia by more than 100 years.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although more than 100 years have passed, this intelligence agency has become bloated and inefficient, but it is still the most trustworthy eyes and ears of the Persian king. It not only monitors the movements of domestic subjects, but also pays attention to the situation in neighboring regions such as Egypt and Greece. Therefore, As soon as the Theonian army appeared in Egypt and Asia Minor, it immediately became its focus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After such a long time, and within the borders of one's own country, the ability of the Royal Secret Service will naturally be able to understand the situation of the Theonian army more clearly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The Theonian army is only 150,000 people. Our army is twice as many as it is. It has such a huge advantage. I don't understand why we don't take the initiative to attack the Theonians. Instead, we shrink back timidly. Taposacus!" Mardonius said loudly, his tone clearly showing dissatisfaction with Artaxerxes, but he had no scruples, not only because his ancestor Gobrias usurped the throne of Persia The closest of the six conspirators of Darius, his family has always been trusted by the royal family, and he was the first top Persian nobleman to support Artaxerxes during the rebellion of Cyrus the Younger. He then helped the Persian king gain the support of the local nobles of Persia and survived the crisis when he first took the throne. He also gained the trust of Artaxerxes, allowing him to hold heavy troops to guard the Susa area, the real capital of Persia. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Artaxerxes was a little embarrassed when faced with Mardonius' accusation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although he has expressed his contempt for the "barbarian country" Theonia in many public occasions, in fact, the Persian king's military performance has almost become a joke among the Persian nobles for so many years in power. The most impressive thing was that when he first came to the throne, he put down the rebellion of Cyrus the Younger, who was quite prestigious among the Persian nobles. But in fact, he knew very well that in that decisive battle, the number of troops he led was greater than that of the opponent. But he was at a disadvantage in the battle. If Cyrus hadn't been stupid and led the charge himself and died in the battle, the outcome would have been completely different.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, when the Theonian kingdom in the Western Mediterranean, which was very aggressive and had almost never suffered a defeat, launched an attack on Persia, he felt a little guilty, so he stayed in Babylon for most of the year, sitting back and watching Canaan and Phoenicia succeed each other. After being captured, he waited until the armies from all regions gathered together to give him enough confidence before he dared to take action.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But when he was about to face the Theonian army, he couldn't help but feel a little panicked. The experience of repeated defeats in the past wars came to mind, making him afraid to make a hasty decision.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As the most noble King of Kings, Artaxerxes certainly would not show his timidity in front of the ministers. He glanced at Trebassus next to him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Trebasus immediately understood and said: "The king actually wanted to attack the Theonian army a long time ago, but he was dissuaded by me. Lord Mardonius, although our army is large in number, what is its combat effectiveness? You should have a lot of experience after staying here for so long. The indigenous people and barbarians who account for half of the army look fierce, but they only know how to rush and fight blindly, and do not know how to form formations or obey orders. , let alone know how to cooperate with our Persian army, and attack the Theonian army in this state, they will only become a burden to us.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So we need to spend some time training them and let them become our support as soon as possible.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mr. Mardonios, you have also commanded several such trainings, and you should have felt their progress. I believe that it will not be long before they can cooperate with our army and launch an effective attack on the Theonian army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mardonios snorted and couldn't think of how to refute for a moment.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Halpurgus sneered and jumped in: "They say Lord Trebasus is extremely intelligent, but I think it's nothing more than that!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   We are wasting time here just to make those barbarians a little more obedient.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But don't forget that the Greek coalition forces in Asia Minor are rushing here. Once they join the Theonian army in Syria, the strength of the Theonian army will inevitably increase greatly. It will not be so easy to defeat them. Therefore, we can no longer waste time and must defeat the Theonian army in front of us as soon as possible!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Fanabazos is doing his best to block the advance of the Greek coalition forces, and has achieved very good results. According to the news we have now, the Greek coalition forces have not yet entered the Silesia area, so we still have enough time to Deal with the Theonian army in Syria.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hearing Tribasus mention Pharnabazus, Artaxerxes frowned unconsciously: In fact, through the intelligence of the spies, he already knew the true situation of the battle in western Asia Minor. , although he was angry with Pharnabazus for lying about military information, he did not punish Pharnabazus and even gave him more support, because he knew very well that in such a bad situation in Asia Minor, only Pharnabazus could Bazos can support the overall situation, and Jason, the scapegoat, is just a step down for both parties. Of course, he will take care of the crime of deceiving the emperor and neglecting the emperor after the war. At the&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   same time, it is also because he knows the law. Nabazos's claim that "the Greek mercenaries led by Jason rebelled and surrendered to the enemy" was a lie. Therefore, he rejected the proposals of some Persian officials. Instead of being angry with the Greek soldiers he hired, he also obtained these Greek mercenaries. Bing's gratitude.&#13;
