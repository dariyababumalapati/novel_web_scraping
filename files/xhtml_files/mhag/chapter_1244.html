  </font>&#13;

 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Axikus greeted the guard standing at the door of the wooden house, and then opened the door gently. An unpleasant fishy smell hit his nostrils. He just sniffed, No look of distress.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aviya in the room was also not affected by the smell. She was wearing clothes specially made for animal trainers. Her hair was rolled up into a ball and tied firmly behind her head. She was holding a fat black cat in one hand and a cat in the other. He was holding on to the animal pen and looking at the animal pen with a slightly nervous expression.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Avia...Avia..." Perhaps because Aviya was too focused, Axikus shouted a few times, but she didn't respond. Instead, the black cat turned around and stared at the door with a pair of big eyes. Axikus, and then called "meow" twice.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Only then did Aviya see Axikus waving at the door. She walked over unhappily and whispered: "Why have you been chatting with your brother-in-law for so long? Nana (a female antelope) is about to give birth." "It's gone!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Just now, Pekestas, the son of Mr. Hilos, sent someone to come to me and said that he and his cousin brought some guests to the zoo. They have been waiting in a long line outside. The weather is too hot and there are so many people. They are afraid. The child couldn't bear it and wanted to come in early." Axicus told a little lie and changed the person who asked him for help to Pekestus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This trick really worked, Aviya immediately said: "Ah, Brother Pekestas is here, let them in quickly! I will-" At this point, she looked back with some reluctance. The animal pen, and then changed his words and said: "I will go to see Nana immediately after she gives birth." In the past, those who&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   were called to the king's palace for family banquets by Davos from time to time included the Henipolis family, Aristelas and Azuna's family, Bagule and Andrea's family, Hilos' family... So Aviya is relatively familiar with several of Hilos' children.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Then I'll greet them first." After Axikus finished speaking, he turned around and left.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, the trainer's voice came from the house: "Princess, Nana has given birth!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Aviya heard this, she immediately became excited, grabbed her husband's hand and ran inside: "Nana finally gave birth to a lamb. ! Come and pray with me, hoping that Hades will bless you and the little guy can survive smoothly this time!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;

  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   in Sosikli When the Si brothers took their guests to visit the zoo, an administrative meeting of the kingdom's ministers was going on in the palace hall of the inner city of Turi.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Martius, the captain of the palace guard, saw that the auxiliary ministers and the chief officials of various departments had arrived on time and had sat down as usual. He immediately reported to Davos who was resting in the side hall. Davos then brought Palace Clerk Henepolis walked into the hall from the side door with steady steps and walked up to the throne.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The ministers all stood up immediately and bowed respectfully.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Everyone, sit down." Davos smiled and waved his hand, and the ministers sat down. Then he looked at everyone, and spoke slowly but in a thick and clear voice: "Everyone, today is the last administrative meeting of the month. Regular meeting, the sports meeting will be held in Thurii next month, so the focus of our discussion today is the issue of the sports meeting."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Having said this, he turned his attention to Crotokatax, who was sitting at the bottom on the right side: "Consul, you are the main person in charge of organizing this sports meeting. Please give us a detailed introduction to the preparations for the sports meeting."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, Your Majesty!" Kroto Katak, who has been the consul of the kingdom for more than 4 years Si stood up calmly and said in a loud voice: "My lords, it has been two years and one month since His Majesty announced the Games in June of the year before last. Our preparations have been basically completed. Now I I will give you a detailed report on the entire preparations."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Over the past two years, Crotokatax has devoted most of his energy to the preparations for the games. He has done most of the things himself, so he knows the entire situation well. , without preparing a speech in advance, he coughed slightly, collected his thoughts, and then said loudly: "According to His Majesty's suggestion, the sports meeting held in Thuri will not only include traditional running, wrestling, boxing, racing, horse racing, There are 6 major sports including 5 sports (including running, long jump, discus throw, javelin throw, and wrestling), and we also added archery, iron throw, high jump, pole vault, marathon, and swimming--" "I can do all&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   the others. "I understand, but what is this marathon?" the newly appointed Assistant Minister Bagule couldn't help but ask (in early March, Hermon requested to resign from the position of Assistant Minister due to old age, and Davos approved it. With the support of the Lucanian senators headed by Mongolia, the Senate elected Bagule, the administrator of the Roman region, to take over the post. Davos recognized the result of the election, and Bagule officially performed his duties last month).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Clotokataxus had explained this issue several times in previous administrative meetings, he still patiently explained to Bagule: "I think everyone should know that after the Athenian army defeated the Persians at Marathon a hundred years ago, , the legendary story of the soldier Pheidippides, who ran non-stop from Marathon back to the city of Athens, announced the good news to the people and then fell to the ground and died. In order to commemorate this historical event, His Majesty specially suggested that we set up this competition , so the marathon is a special long-distance running race. Its running distance is the distance from Marathon to Athens, a total of 84 miles." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Eighty-four miles?!" Bagule exclaimed: "Who can do such a long distance? You can run down! Even if you can run down, I'm afraid you will be exhausted!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "We have specially tested it. As long as you don't run too fast, you can run down." Crotoka Tax replied seriously: "We are here. So far, there are 10 runners in our kingdom who have signed up to participate in this event."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Oh, as long as they can run." Bagule nodded, indicating that he understood.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, I have always wanted to ask a question." Military Secretary Olivers couldn't help but said.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   (The year before last, Alexis also resigned from the post of Minister of War on the grounds of old age. Davos had originally drafted several replacement candidates, including Leoticides, Matonis, Lizaru and Olivers. , but the other three refused to leave the army, and eventually the youngest Olivers became the Minister of War instead.)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You tell me."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Marathon is just an ultra-long-distance race, why do we have to commemorate the marathon of the Athenians? Battle? Instead of naming it after some famous battles our kingdom's army fought in the past? For example, the first legion's long-distance attack on the Roman army in Volsey, and our army's landing on the beach of Peleus five years ago. Wouldn't it be better to raid Larissa...in the name of these battles?" Olivers put forward his opinion tactfully.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Of course this won't work!" Davos vetoed it without hesitation: "Whether they are Romans or Thessalians, they are now citizens of the kingdom. Using these battles in the name of them is disrespectful to them and will cause injustice. A good influence. And Marathon was the battle of the Greeks against the Persians. Not only did we have no worries in this regard, but it also showed our respect for the local Greek people, especially the Athenians, and it also helped to enhance the recognition of us by the local Greek people. , at least it can make them participate in this sports meeting more enthusiastically."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty is right, in the reply from Athens to us, there are 5 Athenian runners who signed up to participate in the marathon." Clotokatax continued .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Olivers paused in confusion, nodded and said, "I have no objection now." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Everyone, in order not to waste time, wait until the consul has finished his report. If you ask any questions, let him focus on answering them." Davos said in a calm tone. reminded.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The hall immediately became very quiet, and Clotokatax continued: "...marathon, swimming, speedboat racing, sailing competition, military four sports (including heavy armor racing, javelin throwing, horseback riding, swimming) , a total of 15 major events. Currently, the venues and required equipment for all competition events have been prepared. All regions of the kingdom and the city-states that received invitations, except Persia, have promised to send players to participate. According to them In response to the letter, the total number of players currently participating in the competition is 1,982, and the number of participants in each event exceeds 50...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   According to the preliminary schedule, the games will last for 15 days, so we are ready to vacate all competitions in the Turiyi region Hotels around the stadium and rooms in the Kingdom Hotel in the inner city provide free accommodation and food for players and officials sent from various regions and city-states to ensure that players participating in the games can compete in a better condition (initially, Because of the Kingdom Rugby Finals and Football Finals held every year, Thurii City Hall temporarily set up athlete camps near various arenas. Later, hotels managed by the city hall were gradually built on these temporary camps to prepare for the two annual events. While providing accommodation for football players, we also provide convenience to tourists. As a result, the rooms are often full, which makes a lot of profits for the Thurii City Hall). At the&#13;

 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   same time, we have also reached an agreement with the Carriage Association of Thurii , during the competition, they will be responsible for transporting athletes to the competition venue to avoid being late.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The team of priests and referees from various temples organized by the Temple of Hades has been training for several months and has basically mastered the judging standards of various competitions. , I believe that the entire referee team will be able to fairly judge issues in various competitions and avoid ugly phenomena such as cheating.&#13;

 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ms. Stacey Kordas has provided us with great help. During the competition, the medical department will provide various The venue dispatched a medical team with extensive medical experience to treat injured players and spectators (Helps has retired due to old age, and the medical minister was succeeded by Stacey Kdas)."&#13;
