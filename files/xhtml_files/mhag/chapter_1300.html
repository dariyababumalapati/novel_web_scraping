   Chapter 1300 Visitors from Persia&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, the Tyrians also found out that King Davos personally led an army of more than 100,000 people, and there was also a Greek coalition army of 60,000 to 70,000 people in Asia Minor. A total of more than 200,000 powerful troops had won many victories. The Persian army was vast and unstoppable.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Persian army may be larger in number, but it does not seem to be an opponent of the majestic and uniform Theonian army in terms of combat effectiveness. This is the feeling of General Tire who has followed the Persian army in battle many times.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The more important point is that many Tyrians became prisoners of Theonia during the Cyprus naval battle and are still detained in Cyprus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Tyre's surrender made Davos very happy. He immediately sent a messenger to have the three legions that had landed on Cyprus discuss with the first and second Theonian fleets to formulate a plan to land in the Syrian Gulf and capture Milianrus as soon as possible. city's military plan.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, Tire's surrender also had a huge impact on other Phoenician city-states. They were not as powerful as Tire, and they had no cities built in the sea to defend themselves, and they did not dare to confront Theonia, so Sidon , Aduras and other city-states also quickly surrendered, and the Theonian army successfully conquered the Phoenician region.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos did not immediately lead his army northward. He waited until the Cypriot army successfully landed in the Gulf of Syria before issuing the order to go northward.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But the marching route is no longer along the coast, because the Libanus Mountains have become a barrier to the northern near east coast from north to south. The further north you go, the more difficult it becomes, especially for a group with the size of Theonia. Huge army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos did not choose to bypass Mount Libanus and walk to the edge of the desert to the east. Firstly, the distance was longer, and secondly, the climate there was hot, sparsely populated along the way, and supply of water was difficult. There were no big towns, except in Its southern end is Damascus, very close to the Phoenician region.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Perhaps in the future historical development, Damascus will become a battleground for military strategists in the Near East, but at this time, Davos really did not take it seriously. Although it is still a large town, it has nothing The Persian garrison did not show hostility to the Theonian army. Instead, it sent an envoy to express its neutrality to Davos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, Davos did not spend time to capture Damascus. He just asked the mountain reconnaissance brigade to closely monitor the movements of Damascus. He led the army to leave the Phoenician area and eastward into the Libanus Mountains.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The snowy water of the Amanus Mountains in northern Syria converges into a river, the Orontis River, which flows from north to south through Mount Libanus and finally flows into the northern part of Phoenicia, thus in the center of its mountains. A relatively wide and narrow plain, the Amik Plain, was formed, which was the northward march route of the Theonian army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Worried that the Persians would block heavy troops in the north, Davos ordered the troops in Cyprus to land in Syria first to ensure the smooth movement of the main force northward.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But in fact, Davos was too worried. Not long ago, part of the garrison in Syria had been transferred to Fanabazus in Asia Minor by the King of Persia, leaving the army empty and unable to intercept the main force of Theonia. It cannot even provide adequate defense for the region.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Cypriot army easily landed on the Syrian coast, quickly captured the city of Milianthus, and then quickly moved eastward to surround the town of Sochi at the northern entrance to the Amik Plain.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   By the time the main force of Theonia arrived near Sochi, the town had been captured.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Davos led the army through Sochi and entered the Syrian area, he stopped advancing and began to camp and rest.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The camp being built stretches from the foothills of Mount Amanus in the north to the foothills of Mount Libanus in the south. It is close to the Orontis River in the east and backed by the bay in the west. It occupies a good defensive terrain.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos also sent a large number of scouts across the Orontis River to the east to detect the movements of the Persian army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, he sent some troops to attack the northwest coastal pass, the Syrian Pass. Once it was captured, he continued to attack westward, attacking towns such as Issus, Castabrorum, and Philotas in turn, and opened up the From the coast channel of Asia Minor, connect the Greek coalition forces as soon as possible. After the two armies meet, they will attack eastward together. This is Davos's next plan.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But what Davos didn't know was that the Greek coalition forces that had attacked quickly before were now encountering some trouble.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the Greek coalition forces were frustrated in attacking Haskarnassus, in order not to waste time and reduce the loss of troops, Leo Tichides decided to leave some troops to surround the city, and the main force of the army continued to advance eastward.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, after passing through Caria and entering the Lycia region, the Greek coalition forces could no longer advance along the coast, because Lycia and the adjacent Pisidia region were mountainous and the roads were difficult to travel, so the army could only circle northward. Passing through Lycia and Pesidia, and then passing through the pass of the Taurus Mountains in the Cappadocia region, entering the fertile Silesia region. Most of the roads to be traveled are the roads built by the Persian royal court to control the empire. The straight road in the west of Asia Minor. Although this road is easier to walk, it goes into the interior of Asia Minor.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During this period of time, Pharnabazus, the Persian military commander in Asia Minor, reorganized part of the defeated army and received some reinforcements from the royal court (Pharnabazus' battle report was sent to Artaxerxes After that, the King of Persia believed the letter that said "the battle failed because of the sudden rebellion of the Persian mercenaries." Therefore, he did not remove him from his post. Instead, he sent more reinforcements and ordered him to do his best to stop the Greek coalition forces in (in Asia Minor), the strength was partially restored, but the irony is that Pharnabazus did not dare to face the Greek coalition this time. Instead, he decided to implement the suggestion of Jason who was killed by him: strengthen the wall and clear the country, and at the same time send Small groups of troops took advantage of the terrain to continuously disrupt the transportation lines of the Greek coalition forces.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The governors of Asia Minor, who had already tasted the powerful fighting power of the Greek coalition, did not firmly oppose this time, allowing this strategy to be implemented.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the Greek coalition failed to capture Halicarnassus, an important town with a large port, more of the Greek coalition's grain transport fleets could only land at the port of Miletus. The supply line was stretched, and Pharnabazos The defensive tactics also posed a huge threat to this long supply line. The Greek coalition forces entering the inner route were unable to collect food and grass on the spot, and had to send heavy troops to protect the supply line, seriously slowing down the eastward advance.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In September, the relief force sent by Davos captured Issus and captured Castabru Mu, and even marched westward to Maras, which was only separated from the fertile Silesia by the Alain Plain.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But the Greek coalition forces had not even passed through Pisidia and reached the Cappadocia area. The two sides were far apart.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During this period, the scouts sent to the east to explore reported back: they discovered a huge Persian army near the city of Taposakus (the city is located on the banks of the Euphrates River, more than 200 miles away from the Eurontis River). Military camp, and Persian troops continue to come from the east...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Persian army is finally coming!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ...Both Davos and his generals immediately cheered up. Not only did they order their soldiers to strengthen the camp and strengthen defenses, but Davos also sent messengers to the Alleyn Plains to inform preparations there. The troops responding to the Greek coalition returned immediately.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not long after, many Persian cavalry appeared on the east bank of the Orontis River, trying to cross the river to spy on the Theonian military camp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Theonian cavalry drove them away, and small-scale fights broke out many times. However, the main forces of both sides stayed in Syria and the other was stationed near Taposakus. Both sides stood still and faced off for more than a month.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At dusk that day, a guest was welcomed into Davos's tent.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Izam, you are finally back! I haven't received a message from you for so long. I thought you were nostalgic for your hometown and didn't want to go back to Theonia anymore, hahaha..." Although Davos was joking, his mood But he was very excited, strode forward and gave Yizam a strong hug.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, to be honest, when I return to Dukya and see my brothers speaking familiar words, wearing familiar clothes, eating familiar food... I always feel inexplicably scared -" Iza Mu said with a relieved look: "I'm afraid that my decades of experience in Theonia are just a dream! Now that I see His Majesty, I am completely relieved!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then he said slightly guiltily: " I found that I can no longer live without the prosperous life of Theonia, and I am completely unable to adapt to the poverty of Dukeya..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos comforted him and said: "Under conditions, people are willing to enjoy happiness and will not go there. Take the initiative to bear the pain. But the poverty of Dukiya is mainly caused by the cruel oppression of the Persians. As long as we defeat Persia, I believe that the bad situation of the Dukiya people will gradually improve! Oh, by the way, you go all the way You haven't eaten yet when you come back, right?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, before I came to see you, I went to see Master Mariji and had some food at his place. This time, if Master Mariji hadn't found a Persian caravan, he would be responsible for my actions. Provide cover, there is no way I can reach Dukea so smoothly!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked at Mariji, who had a calm face next to Izam, and said with a smile: "I'm afraid you don't know, Mariji used to be a resident of Dukea. The royal merchant of Prince Rus had a lot of connections among merchants in western Persia. After defeating Carthage more than ten years ago, considering that Persia would become the kingdom's biggest enemy, he quietly secretly worked with the assistance of the Intelligence Department. He supported several trustworthy friends in Persia, and these friends of the kingdom also secretly sold weapons and food prohibited by Persia to Dukya several times..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
