   Chapter 1180 The Battle of Tegea (6)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This sentence is not only to praise the Theonian warriors in the battle, but also to comfort himself.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   That night, he took the risk and sneaked into the city of Tegea alone, and through Pausanias, he summoned the councilors closest to Sparta in the city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He first told them that "the entire Greek anti-Theonian alliance was about to be established and the Theonia army would fail", and then told them that "the Spartan army will assist them in regaining the leadership of Tegea." At the same time, he also made a promise: The Spartans would never kill a Taegian citizen indiscriminately!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It was precisely because of his personal danger that the congressmen finally agreed to his plan, so on the second day the Spartan army suddenly The city of Tegea was surrounded. Just as the Tegea soldiers came to defend the city one after another, the pro-Spartan faction quietly opened a city gate, causing the Spartan army to rush into the city and attack the anti-Spartan MPs. A massacre was carried out.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since Tegea has always implemented an oligarchy with the aristocracy in power with the support of Sparta, ordinary citizens have no power. The pro-Spartan aristocrats regained power and quickly took control of the situation in the city. . Moreover, they and the Spartan army began to pretend to defend and attack the city. Since the entire city was surrounded and blocked, even the dissatisfied people could not get the news out.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And considering that if this time If the battle fails, Tegea will surely suffer revenge from the Theonians, so the pro-Spartans also made a promise to Agesilaus: They will send all the citizens of Tegea who can fight to The Theonians launched an attack.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now that the trap that Agesilaus had carefully set for the Theonian army finally succeeded, he finally breathed a sigh of relief. He could imagine how the next battle would develop: Theonia's left-wing soldiers who had escaped were attacked from the front and back by the Spartan warriors and the Tegea army. Even if they had fighting power, they would be defeated quickly. Then, the Spartan warriors took advantage of the victory , then swept the middle, and finally won the entire battle.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus did not indulge himself for too long. He knew very well that the Theonian army liked to leave a part of the army as a reserve in the battle, so he immediately sent the order The soldier said: "Immediately notify the Thracians and let them attack the right flank of Theonia according to the original plan!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Agesilaus firmly believed that Theonia's left wing would be defeated under attack from both sides before Theonia's reserve troops arrived, he was still more cautious and prepared to attack Theonia. The right wing of Nia also stabbed him, completely disrupting the judgment of the commander of Theonia. Because he had learned from the intelligence from the Arcadians that his previous strategy had taken effect, and Leoticides had been After being transferred, the new commander of Theonia turned out to be the son of King Davos. I heard that this young man who was regarded as the heir to the throne by Davos had little command experience. Faced with such a complex battlefield situation, I am afraid it would be difficult to It was difficult to make a more correct response.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He suppressed the joy in his heart and prayed to Zeus, hoping to give Sparta a great victory to reverse Sparta's current predicament.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Muklu galloped on his horse. Halfway through, he saw smoke and dust billowing in front of him. Countless soldiers in black helmets and black armor rushed towards them with shields and guns behind them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Muklu hurriedly He pulled his horse to get out of the way, and then sped towards the place where a purple-red tasseled helmet was faintly shaking in front of him. When he got closer, he saw that it was indeed the person he was looking for. He hurriedly shouted: "Captain of the Tagetinos Army" , where are you going with your troops?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I want to lead the Seventh Army to the left wing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Tagetinos' tone was still full of dissatisfaction: "Your chief of staff suspected that the Taigean army had rebelled, and asked me to rush to rescue the First Army immediately!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The Tegea army has indeed rebelled. They have already invaded the 1st Army's array from the rear. The situation is very critical!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Damn it, Printors really got it right!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Tagetinos exclaimed and immediately doubled his volume: "Brothers, the First Legion is in danger and must be saved by us. Please speed up your pace. I will kick the ass of anyone who runs slower. !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Roar!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ..." The soldiers then shouted in unison, the footsteps became louder, and the dust mist raised was even bigger.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kalisenos, a Mandinian, looked at the excited Theonian soldiers passing by quickly. Everyone, he seemed to have gained a little more confidence after he had no hope for this battle.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But when he was stunned, Muklu had already left him a long way and went straight to the command center.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Far away .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing Crotokatax wearing a black pendant tassel helmet from a distance, Muklu waved and shouted: "Your Highness, the Tegea army has rebelled and attacked the First Legion from the rear!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although he was persuaded by Printors before, Crotokatax still had a trace of luck in his heart. Now that he was confirmed, his color changed instantly and he suddenly felt nervous. However, he still tried his best to pretend to be calm and used A slightly trembling voice asked: "Lord Printors, thanks to your suggestion, we sent reinforcements in time. Do you think... our left wing can withstand it?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the end, Crotokatax couldn't hold back and asked about his worries.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Printors saw his thoughts and immediately comforted: "Your Highness, there was a time in the "Theonian Military Law" There are strict regulations, "When chasing a defeated army, heavy infantry must try their best to maintain the formation of squads and detachments and must not run away."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As a model for the entire army, the First Legion has always been resolute in enforcing military law. Even if it was hastily encountered by the Spartan army from two sides, it would still be able to confront the enemy with its various detachment square formations. Not only would it not be defeated, but our army is used to it. By fighting independently as a team, you might be able to gain an advantage in such a melee!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "That's good.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Klotokas was doubtful.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Highness, I have another suggestion.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   " Please tell me.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The Spartans set up traps here to fight us. They were well prepared, making us more passive.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   We cannot let the enemy lead us by the nose. We must regain the initiative on the battlefield in order to win the final battle.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "After confirming the news that the First Army was being attacked from both sides, Printols finally made up his mind to implement the plan he had just been brewing. He said in a solemn voice: "I suggest that the three lightly The armored brigade was sent to the north, bypassing the left wing, and attacking the flank of the Spartan army. This was not only to further rescue the First Army, but also to eliminate Sparta's own strength as much as possible.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sparta did not have many young and middle-aged citizens who could fight. To them, each one was precious, so in previous battles they used more allies and mercenaries. This battle involved the rise and fall of city-states. They just dispatched so many Spartans.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   If we set out to attack its right flank with all our strength, the Spartan commander will inevitably launch an all-out rescue effort.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After waiting for the light armored brigade to be dispatched for a while, we sent out the final reserve group, the mountain reconnaissance brigade, to attack the flank of the left flank of the Spartan army, thereby establishing victory in one fell swoop!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Klotokastax listened carefully, thought for a while, and said firmly: "Then I will implement your suggestion!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Tegeans did not expect that they would join the Spartan warriors in the Theonian formation so quickly. At the beginning of their In their imagination, the Theonians' left wing would soon be defeated when faced with the fierce front and rear attacks by them and the Spartan warriors. Then they would take advantage of the situation to pursue the defeated troops and eventually win the entire battle.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But the reality was beyond them .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Unexpectedly, Theonia's left wing did not collapse, but instead shrunk into small square formations and continued to fight. At that time, they rushed into the Theonia formation without thinking about it and rushed into it, which seemed to be about to collapse. It didn't take long for him to find that he seemed to be stuck in a quagmire.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although like the Spartans, most of the soldiers in Tygea's battle were heavy infantry, but unlike the Spartans who had been trained hard since childhood, they wore Corinthian helmets. They are better at frontal combat, but in this crowded and small space, they seem too clumsy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What's worse is that the First Legion's pursuit "not long after the defeat, the advance was quickly stopped due to the attack of the Tegea people." , switching to on-site defense. At this time, the units and companies of the First Army in the rear did not completely run away. When forming the small square formation, not only the organization was complete, but the distance between the square formations was relatively close. This provides the basis for the First Corps to use the tactics of detachment and square formation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Ctissus was not decisive enough in giving orders at the beginning, he had rich war experience after all. He did not hide in any phalanx with his followers in a panic. Instead, he looked at the direction and led them into the rear part of the formation. In a square formation in the center, just as the Tegea soldiers rushed in like a tide, he asked the buglers to blow the bugles continuously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the soldiers in the nearby squadron formation couldn't see clearly what was going on around them, they could hear the familiar sound of the bugle. It was as if the ships sailing in the dark had seen the lighthouse and began to consciously move in the direction of the sound of the bugle. Although each phalanx moved very slowly, their unanimous actions made it more difficult for the Tegea soldiers crowded between the phalanxes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not long after, a greater disaster struck. Three thousand infantrymen of the Seventh Legion led by Tagetinos finally arrived, and they immediately launched a fierce attack on the Taigean soldiers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The rear part of the Tegea army was mainly made up of light armored soldiers. They could not confront the heavy infantry head-on, not to mention these Theonian legionnaires who came like wolves and tigers. They were quickly defeated, but were defeated by the second army. The attack line that the Seven Legions had already launched was rushing to attack the dense crowd in front, which not only made the Taigea army confused, but also made the already crowded space even narrower.&#13;
