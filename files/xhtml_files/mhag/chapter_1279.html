   Chapter 1279: Landing in Asia Minor&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is because although Mysia is a relatively wealthy area in western Asia Minor, it has the fertile Alispi Plain and controls the shipping trade of the Hellespont Strait. It has enough financial resources and materials to form an army. A powerful army to resist the invasion of the Theonian army, but Theopompus, who has been in office for more than a year, has obviously not yet integrated the entire region. Many towns did not respond to his orders at all, causing the Theonian army to Four days after the army landed, he mustered less than 6,000 soldiers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even though Theopompus knew from the intelligence that the number of soldiers landing in Theonia was greater than his army, as a noble from the central region of Persia, facing the "Greeks" who they regarded as barbarians ( Persia and Theonia have been officially at odds for more than five years, but many Persian nobles still disdain to understand Theonia and even regard it as part of Greece). He led his army westward without hesitation. A few days later Approaching the camp built by the Tenth Legion near the coast.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He was soon surprised to find that the camp built by the Theonia landing army in just a few days did not look easy to capture. He was hesitating whether to camp on the spot first and then make plans. Dai, who had already prepared The entire army of the Onian Tenth Legion suddenly rushed out of the camp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The two sides started a small battle, and the winner was decided after half an hour.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the forward attack of the light infantry brigade of the Tenth Legion disrupted the long-range attack of the Persian archers, it did not cause any casualties to the Theonian Legion soldiers, and the Persian infantry array without heavy infantry could not stop the Theonian Legion soldiers at all. The Persian cavalry, which made a roundabout attack from both wings, was hit by javelins from two heavy infantry brigades specially placed by Stepforth on both wings, resulting in heavy casualties. In the end, the Persian army was defeated.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Theopempus fled back to Zelea, the capital of the Misia region, he did not dare to act rashly again. While strengthening the defense of the city, he urgently sent messengers for help.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since Theonia officially declared war on Persia, Theonia's intelligence officers have begun to spread the word among the Greek city-states in Asia Minor: The great King Davos will execute the oracle of Hatis and end the centuries of Persian aggression against Greece. Human bullying was returned to Persia, and the compatriots in Asia Minor were to be rescued from Persian rule and regain their right to freedom and independence!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Many Greek city-states in Asia Minor were feeling aggrieved because of the Persians' breach of treaty. Although this rumor made them excited, they were also uneasy because Agesilaus's campaign in western Asia Minor had brought several years of trouble to these Greek city-states. There was turmoil and war, so even though the Theonian army won this small battle, these city-states still adopted a wait-and-see attitude and did not take the initiative to approach Dionisia, which had already established a foothold in Misia. Runners up team.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Styphros once sent envoys to visit Ilion and Abydos, which were closest to the camp (these two city-states are located on the east coast of the Hellespont), but they turned away.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stepforos did not become angry because of this and sent troops to attack the city or destroy the villages and towns outside the city. Instead, he followed the instructions of King Davos and held a grand sacrificial ceremony on the beach near Ilion City. The objects were the heroes of the ancient Trojan War, not only Agamemnon and Achilles, but also Hector and Paris. After the sacrifice, there were also sports competitions, which made the entire sacrifice activity a big deal. It was so huge that it attracted many nearby Greek people to come and watch it, causing quite a heated discussion.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos's goal was achieved. He wanted to spread this sacrificial event through these Greeks in Asia Minor and spread a message to the Greek city-states in western Asia Minor: Theonia is equal to the Greek city-states on both sides of the Aegean Sea. treat.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But why choose to hold the sacrifice near the city of Ilion?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Because according to old legend, the city of Ilion was built on the ruins of Troy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Mysian messenger arrived in Babylon, and Artaxerxes learned that "the vanguard of the Greek coalition had landed in Asia Minor." News, I suddenly felt nervous.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, what the messenger mentioned about the local forces in Mysia not responding actively to the call and being suspected of rebellion also attracted his attention. Trebasus suggested to him: appoint the son-in-law of the King of Persia, the former Frigis Governor Pharnabazus was the temporary military commander of western Asia Minor. With his former prestige, he might be able to integrate the military forces in western Asia Minor and repel the invading Greek coalition.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The King of Persia hesitated for several days, and after learning the news that "Theopompus suffered a defeat in the battle", he finally issued an order: to let Phanaba, who had been transferred to Babylon by him with great difficulty more than ten years ago, Zoth traveled to western Asia Minor.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After learning about the crisis facing western Asia Minor, Phanabazos, a veteran general in his 60s, rushed to western Asia Minor day and night. At the same time, he sent a messenger in the name of the military commander of western Asia Minor, requesting the governors of various regions in western Asia Minor to lead the army as soon as possible. The army met at Geldium, the capital of Phrygia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Pharnabazus, who was familiar with the situation in Asia Minor, also wrote letters to various Greek city-states on the western coast of Asia Minor. In the letter, he argued that the King of Persia felt that some governors of western Asia Minor had not fulfilled the promises they had made to the Greek city-states. Very angry, this time he was sent to Asia Minor. One of his main tasks was to urge these governors to fulfill the promises of the King of Persia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the end of the letter, he also swore in the name of Ahura Mazda.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Pharnabazos's reputation in western Asia Minor made his letter effective. Some city-states that were dissatisfied with the new governor's practices were shaken. Some city-states that had deep ties with Persia firmly supported Persia in its fight against those from the West. The strange kingdom of Theonia in the Mediterranean eventually led to the formation of the "Persian-Asia Minor United Fleet" advocated by Pharnabazus. It had approximately more than 400 warships and nearly 60,000 crew members.&#13;

 <br/>&#13;

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the Theonian Tenth Army successfully landed in Asia Minor and defeated the Mysian Persian army, Leoticides was worried The failure of this small battle will inspire the Persians to step up reinforcements to Mysia. The landing force may not be able to be supported independently for a long time by just one legion. Once it suffers a failure, the Greek coalition forces will lose a favorable landing site, so he decided to send Troops landed in Mysia one after another.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, when the harvest in September was over and the Greek city-states began to gather their troops, Leoticides personally led the Eleventh Legion, the Twentieth Legion and the Thessalian Cavalry Legion by boat to Mysia, and met with the Tenth Legion. The regiments converged.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, he had keenly felt that the nearby city-states such as Ilion, Abydos, and Tenedos were further alienated from the Theonian army, such as refusing to allow the ships of the Theonian army to use their ports to load and unload supplies. , prohibiting their merchants from selling supplies to the Theonian army...etc.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The hostility shown by the Greek city-states in Asia Minor made Leoticides heighten his vigilance. In order to reduce the pressure on logistical supplies and to allow the subsequent Greek coalition forces to land more smoothly, he decided to change the strategy formulated by the previous kingdom. After the envoy of the Theonian army once again requested Ilion to open the port and was rejected, Leoticides brazenly led his army to surround Ilion and asked it to surrender to Theonia. However, he was rejected, so he issued an order Order: Siege the city!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   According to legend, the walls of Troy hundreds of years ago were so thick that the Greek coalition failed to capture it after 10 years of attack. But at that time, Troy was not only a large city, but also one of the overlords in western Asia Minor, receiving support from many allies. , so it could be defended for so long; although today's Ilion can be considered a medium-sized town, it is far from comparable to its predecessor, Troy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides has three infantry legions and one cavalry legion under his command, with a total of 26,700 men, and the fourth fleet is temporarily under his command. From the sea to the land, the city of Ilion is tightly surrounded. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What's more, the siege technology of the Theonian army is far from what the Greek coalition forces could compare with hundreds of years ago. Therefore, on the fifth day after the siege, the Ilyons couldn't bear it and could only attack the Theonian army. surrender.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leotychides accepted their surrender and sent part of his army to the city of Ilion, thus taking control of this important hub on the Hellespont.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The news that "Ilion City was captured" quickly spread throughout the surrounding areas, frightening the neighboring Greek city-states. They had to send envoys to express goodwill to the Theonian army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides took the opportunity to propose that they provide a certain amount of military rations and supplies in exchange for a promise to ensure the security of their city-state, and they agreed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, Leoticides also sent troops deep into the inland areas of Mysia, surveying the terrain and understanding the enemy's situation, while harvesting wheat fields and increasing grain reserves.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Theompus, the governor of Mysia, was unable to stop the Theonian army and had to send messengers to Fanabazus many times for help.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, Pharnabazus, who was staying in Geldium, was still waiting for the troops from various regions in Asia Minor to converge. He could only issue orders to the already formed Asia Minor combined fleet, hoping that they would take action to attack or harass Dio. A fleet of support ships from the Nian Army was deployed to relieve the pressure on land.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before landing in Asia Minor, Leoticides sent a messenger to notify the Greek allies, asking them not to lead their troops to Thessaly to join forces, but to take a boat directly to the landing site opened by the Theonian army in Mysia. land, so starting from the end of September, armies formed by various Greek city-states began to sail to Asia Minor. Therefore, a troop transport fleet crossed the Aegean Sea every few days, not to mention that there were fleets transporting supplies every day. between two continents.&#13;
