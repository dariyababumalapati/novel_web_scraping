   Chapter 1112 Hades Davos&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, the familiar bells sounded from the northwest, nine rings in a row, and then nine more after an interval.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The spectators at the square turned to look north, and were surprised to find a huge golden statue standing on the Hill of Gods, which was extremely dazzling under the sunlight.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Oh! That's...the statue of Hades!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The previous rumors are true. The kingdom has really built a statue of Hades that is comparable to the Colossus of Athena in Athens!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the sunlight reflected by the statue It was so dazzling, but the people still opened their eyes desperately and focused their revered gaze on the hills, their faces full of excitement and enthusiasm.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Soon they discovered that not only the statue of the god brought them surprises, but the newly renovated temple that was just displayed in front of them was also pleasant: not only was it taller, more spacious, and more magnificent than before, but there were also pictures painted on the top of the temple. The colors of the pediment are also more vivid and colorful, and they are still shining like stars in the sky (actually it is an innovative work of the craftsmen. They crushed the colored glass made of sea sand and mixed it with the drawings. The effect produced by the pigments under the sunlight).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Greeks have always believed that temples are the homes of the gods, and the place where they live must be a magnificent and magnificent building, and this converted temple on the top of the mountain is undoubtedly in line with their most extreme imagination.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So, under the command and leadership of the patrol team, the people couldn't wait and turned into a stream of people, flocking to the Hill of the Gods.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The closer they get to the hill, the more the people feel the towering and hugeness of the statue. However, it does not give people a sense of oppression caused by majesty. On the contrary, he lowers his head, making it easy for the people to see his face clearly. The kindness and compassion shown made people want to get closer to him even more.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before long, the entire hill, except for the temple on the top of the mountain, was completely surrounded by crowds of people. The people gathered outside the warning circle formed by the palace guards. His eyes were focused on the temple and the colossus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Some attentive people also discovered that the biggest difference between the appearance of the new temple and other Greek temples is that there are many small square windows regularly left on the stone wall under the pediment on the roof of the temple. There is a sculpture in each of them, which looks very strange.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But what the people standing in the distance and unable to see clearly do not know is that these are not ordinary sculptures. They are not just major Greek gods such as Zeus, Hera, and Apollo, but also those of the Brutians. The goddess Amara, the Samnite god Vosani, the Roman Jupiter, Diana... and other statues of gods respected by other races in the kingdom.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   These numerous statues of gods are erected in the stone walls, surrounding the statue of Hades in the temple, like stars holding the moon, and their meaning is self-evident.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos stood solemnly in front of the temple. Next to him was the scepter priest Plessinas in a white robe, and behind him were dozens of Hades priests and saints also wearing white robes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plessinas coughed slightly and slowly took two steps forward with a cane.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While he was speaking, the priests also spoke with the same words. Unlike ordinary messengers, they could speak in a neat tone and with the same emotion, thus creating an amplified resonance, so although everyone was not hysterical The shouting can send the words of Plessinas to the ears of every people on the hill like gentle wind and drizzle:&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Citizens of Theonia, believers of Hades, today is a worthwhile day." A day of celebration! We rebuilt the golden body of the great Hades and rebuilt the divine residence so that he could live in the temple more comfortably and protect us better!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before the establishment of Theonia, Ha Dis's contribution to the Greek people has been buried. Not only did no one praise his achievements, but they were afraid of him and stayed away from him. Until the appearance of his descendant Davos, in just 20 years, A powerful kingdom was established within a short period of time, and Hades was honored as the patron saint of the kingdom. Not only did hundreds of people become believers of this great god, but also the justice and justice that Hades had been fighting for. Strictness, dedication, and sacrifice have become the concepts followed by the people of the entire kingdom.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This made Hades very happy. In order to thank his descendants for their great achievements for him, he passed down the oracle and allowed King Davos to be crowned As long as Davos and his descendants continue to respect him and continue to perform their duties on the ground, he will always protect this family, and anyone who attempts to maliciously infringe will be punished by him forever. Curse!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this point, Plessinas looked back at Davos, bent down, and said respectfully: "His Majesty the Holy King Hades Davos, please bring your crown and accept the believers. Congratulations!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos solemnly took the exquisite wooden crown woven with ebony and ferns on a black tray and slowly put it on his head.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The surrounding people once again burst into cheers like a tsunami: "His Majesty King Davos is victorious!!!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Hades. King Davos is victorious!!!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since landing in Magna Graecia more than 20 years ago, Capture Thurii, establish Theonia, defeat Crotone, oust Syracuse from the throne of overlord, reduce Carthage to an ordinary city-state, and establish the most powerful kingdom in the history of the Western Mediterranean. , Davos's prestige has reached its peak in the kingdom.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What's more, without the restraints of Cunogorata, Cornelus and others, no elder has ever objected to the important decision of this celebration, allowing Davos to easily cover himself and his family. A layer of divine light.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It was a sunny morning, and Maximus was walking on the streets in the military camp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Said to be a military camp, the soldiers prefer to call it a military city. Compared with the nearby Etruscan towns, it is indeed more like a city: the entire camp covers an area of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;one mile, is square, and is 5 meters high. Surrounded by city walls, they are all made of thick square bricks, and towers as high as 10 meters are built every 50 meters on the wall.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The ground in the entire city is completely paved with hard stone slabs, which avoids water accumulation and muddy ground caused by rain and snow. It also allows soldiers to walk on such a smooth and hard road, and always feel a sense of security in their hearts. Feeling - in such a camp made entirely of stones, they can resist the attack of any powerful enemy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The reason why Maximus is here is because after he joined the Theonia intelligence department last year, he received a new appointment while still undergoing training, allowing him to apply to join the important organization being formed as a free citizen. Mercenaries heading to the Etruscan border.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After successfully joining, monitor this legion at all times and report information about it and the enemy situation around it at any time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the beginning, Maximus psychologically resisted this order because he did not want to be far away from his wife and children. He even deliberately performed poorly during the interview to avoid being selected.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Unexpectedly, not many of the free people who signed up were literate, but Maximus was able to write fluent articles in Theonian script and could also do math. He was a rare talent in the new legion. He signed up on the spot. After he was admitted, he was immediately given the position of statistician in the supply camp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In this way, Maximus became a member of the Etruscan border regiment.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then, he was gathered together with all the recruited free people in the Turiyi military camp and trained for three months.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It was three months of hell.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In order to enable these rookies who lack military training and have not even participated in combat to become qualified Theonian soldiers as soon as possible and be put to use as soon as possible, the Ministry of Military Affairs dispatched a large number of military training officers to conduct high-intensity training on them. Training, and it is stipulated that logistics personnel such as Maximus must also participate, because the reason is very good: the logistics personnel of each legion in Theonia must participate in the battle as auxiliary soldiers at critical moments in the battle, and the Border Legion is no exception.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But without military skills and unfamiliar with Theonia's military tactics, how can these logistics personnel cooperate in combat?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So we should also train together.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Fortunately, the training intensity of logistics personnel is not as intense as that of legionnaires, and high-intensity training means sufficient food security, so Maximus will follow legion logistics officers from time to time to purchase food in the city of Thurii.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During this period, Maximus' talents in financial management and bargaining with vendors were demonstrated, and attracted the attention of the Legion's senior leaders. By the end of the three-month training camp, Maximus had been promoted to purchasing director. This It is the third most important military position in the army's baggage camp, after the baggage officer and the guard officer.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not long after, more than 8,000 people from the Border Legion headed north into Etruscan territory.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, after many discussions between the Kingdom and the Etruscan Alliance, the land allocated to Theonia had already been reached, and the address of the military camp had been determined long ago, and the engineers dispatched by the Ministry of Military Affairs and the various Iraqi The general outlines were formed through the joint efforts of the labor provided by the city-state of Trulia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus followed the legion headquarters to a military camp not far from the northern Etruscan city-state of Florentia. Then the soldiers had to use their newly learned and unfamiliar construction skills to build the entire The construction of the military camp was completed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During this arduous process of building a camp, the recruits will further learn to obey orders, endure hardships, and cooperate with each other... completely eliminating the laxity they had as free people, and gradually transforming into a Theonian legionnaire.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Also during the process of building the camp, Maximus' ability to organize and coordinate was fully utilized, so a few months later the legion's baggage officer was transferred back to the Military Affairs Department, and then the legion commander directly ordered: Maximus Si temporarily acted as a transport official.&#13;
