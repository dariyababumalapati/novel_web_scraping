   Chapter 1104 Appointment of the Commander of the Border Corps&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is the only veteran who voluntarily gave up the campaign. On the contrary, Davos found his self-knowledge particularly rare.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Finally, Triphias was elected.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Next, Xima was elected as the administrator of the Bruti region, Latignes was elected as the administrator of the Lucania region, and the most important region of the kingdom, the Thurii region, was the last to be elected (because the original The Turiyi Region itself has a regional character, and the towns it governs occupy most of the newly divided Turiyi area by Davos. Under the suggestions of several rotating presidents, Davos finally canceled the original The administrative unit of the Thurii region was approved by the Senate, thereby avoiding future conflicts between the chief executive of the Thurii region and the chief executive of the region). Originally everyone thought this would be the most intense. Election, so many powerful senators deliberately avoided it and competed in other areas. As a result, the first name called out by the etiquette officer made the remaining senators who were interested in running feel cold: "Lord Alexis!" Military&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Affairs Minister Alexis also participated in the selection, so he is likely to represent the opinions of the entire military faction.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I recommend Lord Siros." Alexis' words were not serious, but those who were still lucky were hit hard again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Both were born as mercenaries, they also made many military exploits for the kingdom, and they both served as ministers of military affairs. But the difference between Hilos and Alexis is that he also made great achievements in civil affairs. As early as before the Western Mediterranean War, He served as the administrator of many towns. After he resigned as Minister of Military Affairs, he went to the Samonai Mountains to become the administrator of Beneventom. He also had outstanding political achievements and was a rare all-round military and political talent.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   More importantly, he had a close relationship with King Davos during the expedition to Persia more than 20 years ago, and is now one of Davos's trusted ministers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, the results of the final round, which was originally thought to be the most fiercely competitive, were completely one-sided. Hilos had received more than 70% of the votes and was successfully elected as the chief executive of Thurii District.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When all the results were settled, the long meeting was finally coming to an end, but the elders were excited, disappointed, etc., and it seemed that they still had more to say.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos kissed his throat and finally said: "Congratulations to the elders who have become regional administrators. Your efforts in past government affairs have been recognized by most of your colleagues today. But the promotion of the position only brings about Temporary joy, but what you will face will be a greater test. To manage more towns and govern more people, the difficulties will undoubtedly be much more. Even some administrative experience gained in the past will be used in the new government affairs. It may no longer be suitable. This requires you to put in more efforts and find out an effective method of governing the region through continuous practice and continuous resolution of difficulties. This will become an experience that future generations can learn from. I also hope that you can use these The region will be governed more prosperously, and you&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   will live up to the recommendation and trust of other elders! Other elders who are interested in becoming one of them in the future, I hope you will continue to work hard and achieve more achievements to win the recognition of your colleagues and me. I believe in you Eventually, like them, you will become a regional chief executive or an important minister of the kingdom. Because the kingdom has a vast land and a large population, it needs more outstanding administrative talents to manage this great country that is still expanding. And you are the elite of the kingdom and must Take on this important responsibility!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What Davos said drove away the disappointment in the hearts of many senators, and also ignited the expectations in the hearts of more senators. Amidst warm applause, the meeting came to an end.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A few days later, the elected regional chief executives rushed to their respective jurisdictions one after another. As the first regional chief executive of the Kingdom, the first thing they had to do was to select those they deemed appropriate in accordance with the framework of the regional administrative organization established by the Kingdom's Administration Office. officials to enrich the entire management organization.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Half a month after the new Immigration Bill was announced, recruitment for the Border Guard Corps also began.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing that things were irreversible, the free people in the kingdom began to make choices for their future. In the end, many young free people came to Turiyi and, in accordance with the requirements of the notice, flocked to the Turiyi military camp to prepare for registration and selection. Become a mercenary soldier in the Kingdom of Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, the two newly promoted legion commanders also went to their new stations to serve. Patroclus went north to Rome to take over the Fourteenth Legion, replacing Printoles (Printals was in the Western Mediterranean). He also made outstanding achievements in the war, and Davos wanted to reuse him. However, considering that he was from the Mountain Reconnaissance Brigade and was later directly transferred to the staff office, he lacked further familiarity with the affairs of the legion and a resume of service in the legion. In order to To avoid being criticized in the future, he was specifically asked to form a new legion in the Latium area after the war. After a few years, his performance was satisfactory, and Davos considered it was time to transfer him back to take charge of the staff office of the Ministry of Military Affairs. ).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sextus then sailed to southern Iberia to take over the XVIII legion, replacing Chalcedis.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the Western Mediterranean War, Chalcedis, who was once the first captain of the Eighth Legion, was promoted to the commander of the legion due to his contribution to the defense of Selinus. However, after all, he was too junior and too junior. In order to prevent his colleagues from gossiping, At Davos's suggestion, he took the initiative to apply to form the 18th Legion in southern Iberia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This was indeed the hardest, most tiring, and most troublesome job, because at that time the Kingdom of Theonia was not yet able to fully control southern Iberia. Most of the territory was still governed by members of the Magonid family, and the people under their jurisdiction were They were either Phoenicians, Carthaginians or Iberian natives. Very few Theonians immigrated here, so Chalcedis suffered a lot of constraints after arriving here, but he still overcame many difficulties. , after several years of hard work, the Iberian military camp was built, the 18th Legion was formed, and the citizens there were trained as much as possible in accordance with the requirements of military law.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, Chalcedis was obviously unable to do as well as other legions. Coupled with the lack of cooperation from many local officials, the Eighteenth Legion was not very effective in defending against the invasion of the territory by the Iberian natives.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now that Bagule has become the new chief of the region, he will intensify the management of the territory and eliminate unqualified officials. In addition, a border corps will be added to the southern Iberia region. The 18th, which has always been in a defensive posture, will The Legion finally had a good opportunity to counterattack.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Unfortunately, at this time, Chalcedis was transferred back to Thurii, which may become a big regret for him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not long after, the Ministry of Military Affairs also announced the names of the commanders of the two border corps being formed that the generals had long awaited.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   One is Stepophos, who was the captain of the corps during the Western Mediterranean War, but his military exploits were not as dazzling as those of his good friend Patroclus. Therefore, he was promoted to corps commander two years later, but because there was no vacant position, he has been unable to do so. Responsible for training team officers at Turiyi Military Camp, and now there is finally a real vacancy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although in the eyes of many Theonian generals, the soldiers of the Border Legion are all composed of free people and seem to be lower than the existing legion, but according to the regulations of the Ministry of Military Affairs, its legion commanders and team officers at all levels The level is the same as that of other legions, and at this stage they are all held by regular officers of the kingdom (the squad leader does not count as an officer).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The name of another legion commander surprised the generals: Hasdrubal, who was once the main force against the Theonian army in the Western Mediterranean War and a main member of the Magonid family.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Why him?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ...Many generals were confused, and some even quietly asked the Ministry of Military Affairs.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The public reason is: Hasdrubal is the patriarch of the kingdom and a senior officer of the kingdom (after southern Iberia was merged into the Kingdom of Theonia, the Iberian army originally commanded by Mago was ordered to disband, but considering In view of Hasdrubal's prestige among the local people, and in order to make it easier to form a new legion in Iberia, Davos specially created a senior military position for him - military training commander of southern Iberia. In fact, It was hoped that he could call on the local people to actively participate in military training. The real and specific affairs would be completed by a group of military training officers under his subordinates. However, Hasdrubal obviously did not take this position seriously. The double blow of defeat and surrender and the inability to Holding real military power made him decadent for several years, but he was never removed from this military position).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, he followed Mago to fight in Iberia for 10 years. He has rich combat experience in fighting fierce natives in the mountains, which is exactly what he needs to draw on in the subsequent border defense operations.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The real reason why Davos appointed him as the commander of the Border Army is: after transferring several important members of the Magonid family such as Haka and Hasdrubal away from southern Iberia, the kingdom will have to deal with this issue that has not yet been completely resolved. The areas under the rule should be reorganized with emphasis, not only on civil affairs but also on the military. Therefore, Hasdrubal should be made the commander of the kingdom's army and he should be willing to serve the kingdom in order to take advantage of his weakening influence. The hostility of the former Iberian army officers and soldiers living in that area towards the kingdom gave them renewed hope and thus ensured the stability of the region.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, Hasdrubal is indeed a military talent, which is an important reason why Davos is willing to re-enable him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, Hasdrubal was not familiar with the military system and tactics of Theonia. He must also be deeply involved in the recruitment and training of free people to truly become a commander of the Kingdom of Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the banquet that night, during the frank conversation between Davos and him, he finally seriously expressed his willingness to make efforts in this area.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
