   Chapter 1131: Friendly Breakup&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos just nodded to express his understanding, then turned to look at Xenophon, and said with relief: "As a guest, it seems that Xenophon can become the envoy of Sparta. You are indeed doing well in Sparta!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He patted Xenophon on the shoulder again, turned and walked towards his throne, and asked at the same time: "Why did you come to Theonia as an envoy this time? Why? Renewal of the friendship agreement? I remember that it will not expire for several years."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Gesius opened his mouth to speak, but Xenophon quickly stopped him, and then said carefully: "Since the war broke out between Thebes and Sparta, It has lasted for several years, causing great damage to both the Peloponnese and Central Greece. In order to restore peace to Greece, Sparta decided to negotiate peace with Thebes and Athens.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But these two sides They have been fighting each other for years, with many casualties and deep hatred. It is not easy to successfully negotiate a peace, so it is best to find a powerful country to persuade both parties to sit down and negotiate-" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So Sparta chose to come to us. Theonia." Davos, who had returned to the throne, leaned forward and interjected with interest: "It seems that the friendship between the two of us for more than 10 years has not been in vain!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Xenophon and Gesyllus both A look of embarrassment appeared on his face.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Xenophon coughed twice and whispered: "Uh... that... Sparta did consider inviting Theonia as a mediator, but although Theonia is powerful, it has no influence in mainland Greece. It is difficult to deter the rebellious Thebes and Athens. And Sparta happened to find out that Athens and Thebes sent envoys to Persia&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   one after another... You also know that the last Corinthian War was finally able to cease the war and reach an agreement. Persia played a big role in it. In order to prevent Persia from turning to support the enemy, Sparta had to send envoys to Persia -" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Theonia has little influence in mainland Greece. Isn't it because of us? Have you strictly abided by the friendly agreement signed with Sparta? Although it is so close to the Greek mainland, our Theonia has not interfered with the political situation of the Greek mainland for more than 10 years. Now Sparta blames us Theonia. There is no influence in mainland Greece!" Antaolis, one of the auxiliary ministers, couldn't help but interjected and complained: "On the contrary, Sparta secretly did some things in the Western Mediterranean during the agreement, giving us Theonia Adding some trouble!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I also have a question for the Spartan envoy. As we all know, Sparta has been supported by Persia in these years, so the 'King's Contract' was signed and it became the main island of Greece again. Leader of the city-state, this time if Sparta wants to cease war and negotiate, shouldn't it first seek support from Persia? Why did the envoys of Athens and Thebes get ahead because they have to consider our Theonia first? ?" Another auxiliary minister Sipulos also raised his own questions, trying to expose some lies in Xenophon's words.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Facing the questions from Theonian ministers, Xenophon, although he had been prepared before, could not help but feel a little nervous at the moment: "This... Theonia's performance of keeping his promise is very respected by the Spartans!... And because You defeated Carthage and became stronger...and...and very close to the Peloponnese, so Sparta did first think of asking Theonia for help, but the reality is-"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   " Okay, needless to say any unnecessary explanations. Since Sparta has decided to seek support from Persia, why did it send you to Theonia? Did Persia reject Sparta's request?" Davos smiled half-heartedly. asked.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Xenophon came into contact with Davos's profound eyes, he had a vague illusion. It seemed that the Theonian king had known the whole matter. Suddenly, he was so blessed that he no longer defended himself and said directly: "Persia Promise to support Sparta, but ask Sparta to sever friendly ties with Theonia, otherwise they will turn to support Athens and Thebes, giving Sparta an unprecedented failure! So Sparta I was sent here as an envoy just to end the friendly agreement with Theonia that has lasted for more than 10 years..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Xenophon's words immediately caused quite a commotion in the hall.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "In order to gain the support of Persia, Sparta did not hesitate to sever friendly ties with our Theonia. Isn't it afraid of offending our Theonia and triggering a new war?!" Military Minister Alexis asked sharply.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Gaisylus, who had been silent before, couldn't help but said loudly: "Before leaving, King Agesilaus once told me that it was really necessary to end the friendly agreement with Theonia this time. Wait until the armistice contract is signed. After that, we Sparta will resume contacts with Theonia and sign a new friendship agreement, please don't worry!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It's okay if he didn't say this. After saying this, the whole hall was like a frying pan. Even Haka, who is usually mild-mannered, said coldly: "What does Sparta mean? Do we, Theonia, look so easy to bully! If you want to break the contract, break the contract, if you want to renew the contract, renew it! You have to know this It is the Western Mediterranean, and Theonia is the only king here. Any city-state and force is rushing to attach itself to Theonia, and is proud to join the Theonia Alliance!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   With the current strength of Theonia, it is already very Don't sign reciprocal agreements with other city-states. Since you Spartans don't think this friendly agreement is precious, then after this agreement is torn up, you Spartans will deeply feel the consequences of the Corinthian War and the The kind of terrible pressure that you can't feel in the Theban war!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Gaisylus finished speaking, Xenophon knew that something was going to happen. Seeing that Gaisylus wanted to refute, he quickly stopped him and subconsciously said to him Davos cast a pleading look.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay." Davos raised his hand and suppressed the anger of the important minister. He said sternly: "We Theonians regard promises as life. Once the agreement is signed, no matter what happens in the future, it will be fulfilled. Agreement. But perhaps for Sparta, the agreement was signed with the intention of tearing it up. The Peloponnesian War achieved an armistice, but the Corinthian War broke out within a few years. Not long after the King's Peace was signed, another war broke out. In the Theban War, Sparta was not the first to break the agreement and provoke the war. Therefore, we have already been mentally prepared for this friendly agreement to be canceled by Sparta. If it is canceled, just cancel it, but it is easy to cancel. It will be difficult to regain it again. You must know that many Tarentums and Carthaginians still regret it."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Xenophon was shocked after hearing Davos's meaningful words.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos emphasized his tone and asked word for word: "I am now formally asking you Xenophon, are Sparta sure to cancel this friendly agreement?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Xenophon quickly replied: "Yes! In order to do it as soon as possible Sparta has no choice but to reach an armistice and restore peace. But I can guarantee that even if the agreement is cancelled, Sparta will still maintain peace with Theonia!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is not up to Sparta." Diver Si smiled slightly: "Now it seems that the King of Persia is very resentful towards our Theonia. But for the sake of you Xenophon, our Theonia will not go to Si because of this breach of contract. Trouble with Bada!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Xenophon was overjoyed and immediately said gratefully: "Thank you, His Majesty the King! The Spartans will keep your goodwill in mind and are willing to maintain peace with Theonia and will never be manipulated by the Persians!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos disagreed. He blinked, held the back of the chair with both hands, and said with a smile: "Now that the business is done, let's talk about private matters. Tonight I will hold a banquet for you in the palace, and I will invite some of the people who worked with me in Persia. My mercenary friends who fought in the battle came to share my feelings of farewell."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Having successfully completed the task assigned by Sparta, Xenophon was now in a relaxed mood and immediately said: "I am very happy to attend this dinner and have a good time with my former comrades. Let's have a drink to make up for the regrets of the past."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos smiled and looked at Alexis and Secretary of Commerce Marij: "You two are indispensable for tonight's banquet, so I will extend an invitation to you first."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alex Sis and Mariji quickly expressed their willingness to participate.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Xenophon and Geselus exited the palace, Antaolis, who could no longer hold himself back, immediately asked: "Your Majesty, are we just going to forget about Sparta's wanton breach of the agreement?!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then you What else do you want?" Davos looked at him and asked calmly: "Declare war on Sparta?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "At least we should find a way to punish them for this rude behavior, otherwise other city-states will think that we are Dionis You are too weak to be bullied!" Antaoris' tone was still tough.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked at him, then at other ministers with different expressions, and said thoughtfully: "Just punishment will not cause much damage to Sparta, but will arouse their vigilance. The Persians want to serve as mediators , to reunify the Greek city-states that have been in constant war, I am afraid they want to cause trouble for us Theonia... The Spartans want to use the support of Persia to become the leader of the Greek city-states again... They all want to It's great, but I think things may not be as smooth as they imagined..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What do you mean, Your Majesty?" Sipulos was moved in his heart.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos did not respond directly, but smiled slightly: "What we need to do now is to pay close attention to the development of the war situation in Greece and wait for a favorable opportunity to arrive&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  ---&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Considering that some former mercenary veterans were still serving in other places, the dinner that night was not held but was postponed to two days later.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During these two days, Davos specially sent someone to accompany Xenophon and visited most places in the Turiyi region, allowing him to have a deeper understanding of the situation in the Kingdom of Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
