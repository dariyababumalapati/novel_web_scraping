   Chapter 1072 Visiting Melses&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Sedorum, others also agreed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "In this case, after obtaining the consent of Haka and Hasdrubal, Lysias will submit the bill to add a rotating president to the Senate for discussion and approval."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, Your Majesty.&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Everyone secretly breathed a sigh of relief.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, Alexis asked: "Your Majesty, your newly divided areas are not consistent with the troop source areas of each legion. Will this affect citizens' participation in military training and expeditions? Is it necessary? Adjust the troop sources of each legion?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I don't think it's necessary." Davos said simply: "The army is an army, and a region is a region. The two sides do not interfere with each other, but they must cooperate with each other. Especially when a war breaks out, each town and region must vigorously Coordinating the legionnaires' expeditions and aftermath issues are stipulated in the Theonian Laws, and I don't think any official at any level would dare to obstruct or violate them!&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After answering Alexis's question, no one asked any more questions for a while, so Davos continued: "Let me talk about some adjustments to the levels of the kingdom's officials after the division of regions and the addition of the post of regional administrator.&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Everyone pricked up their ears again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The rotating president is still the highest-ranking official in the kingdom, followed by the ministers of each department. The regional administrators are at the same level, but they must be elected by the Senate; the city administrators are at the same level as the junior officials of each department. This Intermediate officials will no longer be elected by the Senate, but directly decided by the Kingdom's Administrative Council..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty's decision is so right!" Hormone praised loudly: "There are now more than 100 large and small towns in the kingdom, and city chief executives arrive almost every 3 or 4 days. The Senate is busy selecting successors every day. Where is the extra time to do other important things!&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Others also felt this, and senior members of the Senate such as Lysias and Cedorum thought more: Since the kingdom's administrative meetings were held frequently, many of the kingdom's internal affairs issues have been resolved here, and even many laws have been passed. It is also discussed here first, and after a resolution is formed, it is then taken to the Senate meeting for approval. Since the five rotating presidents and ministers from various departments are all important members of the Senate, it is easy for the proposal to be passed when they have reached an agreement. In this way, the affairs of the Senate have been reduced a lot. If it is further The matter of selecting chief executives of various towns has also been cancelled, and the role of the Senate has been greatly weakened!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Lysias looked at Davos who was thinking about what to say, and thought a lot for a while.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Next is the Demo chief executive of each town, and then the village chief... This constitutes the most basic level 5 administrative officials in the kingdom. The levels of officials in other departments will be adjusted accordingly according to this standard. Oh, by the way ! The city chief executive of each district government should be half a rank higher than the ordinary city chief executive... Also, the powers of the district chief executive are not exactly the same as those of the wartime governor we previously appointed. He has the authority to manage the entire region. He has administrative power, but does not have the power to use the army, nor the power to enact local laws. However, although he does not appoint the chief administrators of cities within the region, he can recommend various Demo chiefs..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Everyone thought deeply about every word Davos said, because it was likely to be closely related to their future. However, Archibedes couldn't help but interjected: "Your Majesty, after the kingdom's territory is divided into regions and the chief administrators of each region are appointed, other officials must be assigned to them, right? This adds up to a lot of people, and the level If it's not low, it will be a huge expenditure for the state treasury.&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This is inevitable." Davos comforted him and said: "The larger the territory of the kingdom, the more problems there will be and the more complex the difficulties will be. This requires our governance to be more precise and efficient. Of course, we must We can discuss together what officials should be deployed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   For example, the population of each town used to be small, and one or two clinics and hospitals could solve people's disease problems. Therefore, most towns did not have medical department officials, but now they have established regions to prevent and treat epidemics and supervise the health of the entire region. In case of illness and disease treatment, medical department officials are required to ensure the health of the people in the area.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Another example is whether it is necessary to set up construction department officials in the region, because each subordinate town has its own construction personnel. When the entire region needs to build large public buildings, the local chief executive can completely gather the construction personnel from the subordinate towns. To plan and build&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos and the ministers discussed the issue of the regional administrator until dusk, and finally came up with a clear and clear plan.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After everyone left, Davos stared at the big map and thought for a while before letting Henipolis put the map back.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Henepolis returned to the palace hall, Davos said to him: "Henepolis, don't be in a hurry to go home. Come with me to visit Melses."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, Your Majesty.&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Under the protection of the guards, Davos left the palace. The passers-by he met along the way stopped to say hello to the king, and Davos responded with a smile.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Merses's mansion is not too far from the palace, just at the northern foot of the Hill of the Gods. Compared with the residences of other important ministers and senators, its appearance is very magnificent and conspicuous.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A tribune once reported him, claiming that he lived a luxurious life and suspected him of corruption, which caused a great disturbance.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Ministry of Supervision also specially sent officials to conduct an investigation. It was found that not only did Melses not embezzle money from the treasury, but during the Western Mediterranean War, when the treasury was most stretched, he also used the money he earned from his business to purchase a batch of military supplies. , transported to the front line.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the news was announced, not only the people were in an uproar, but even the officials were surprised, which greatly changed their impression of the miser of the kingdom.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But what I didn't expect was that Melses began to fall ill a year after the war ended. After many active treatments, his condition recurred for more than two years. He finally fell completely ill at the beginning of this year and was unable to govern. Des succeeded him and took charge of the finance department.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Davos walked to the living room, Melses had already come out with the support of two slaves.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, his whole body was too bloated. Although he was covered by a wide white robe, you could still see his swollen legs and bloodshot ankles when he walked around. His face was also dark brown, and his energy was a little listless. , seeing Davos, his spirits lifted a little, he tried his best to smile, and said in a hoarse voice: "Your Majesty, you finally came to see me!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What a forgetful thing, Mercis! I just came to see you once last month!" Davos cursed softly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Visiting once a month is too long... It's better to come every two or three days..." Melses said shamelessly, urging the slave next to him: "Hurry up... help me to your Majesty In front of me...it saves effort to speak like this..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos hurriedly tried to dissuade him: "You are not in good health now, so don't come out. Be careful of catching a cold! Let's go to your bedroom."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty..." Probably after walking for such a long time, Melses also felt powerless and did not persist.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty!!&#226;&#128;&#157; Melses' wife and three concubines also came over, respectfully saluting and saying hello.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Davos returned the gift, he expressed his gratitude to them: "Thank you for your hard work during this time!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What's so hard about it? They cry and cry all the time... It annoys me so much that I want to drive them all out..." Melses cursed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I see that you are recovering at home, and your temper has grown a lot!" Davos said in a scolding tone.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I'm stuck at home every day... I can't scold my colleagues... I can only scold my family...&#226;&#128;&#157; Merses was very calm.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You, you..." With Merses's rogue appearance, Davos shook his head repeatedly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Arrived at the bedroom, the servant carefully helped Melses lie down on the bed, and the big hardwood bed creaked under his pressure.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, Davos saw that Mercis's feet were red, black, and shrunken. While he was shocked, he also felt a strong sadness, which reminded him of Helps not long ago. A pessimistic assessment of Melses' condition.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Melses covered his body with a quilt, he drove out his wife and slaves, leaving only Davos, Hernepolis and Martius in the house.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then, Melses asked: "Your Majesty, you came to visit me today...isn't there something important?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos motioned to Martius to close the door, and then said softly: "Tell you good news, but keep it secret!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mersis saw Martius's actions and nodded solemnly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The kingdom is preparing to increase taxes on the people!&#226;&#128;&#157; Davos said one word at a time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It should have been like this a long time ago!" Merses perked up, then thought of keeping it secret, lowered his voice, and emphasized once again: "The kingdom should have increased taxes a long time ago!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos smiled, then briefly explained the reasons for the tax increase, and then asked seriously: "How much tax do you think should be increased to not only solve the military expenditure problem, but also ease the country's finances and at the same time allow the people to Can you bear it?&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Of course it's 10%!&#226;&#128;&#157; Melses replied without hesitation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Be more serious!" Davos's tone became stern.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mersis was stared at by Davos's majestic gaze and did not dare to say any more nonsense. He thought about it carefully, and then said with some reluctance: "I think... 5% may be more appropriate."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as money was mentioned, Merses became energetic. Not only did he speak more fluently, but his thinking also became sharper. He explained in detail why he chose this tax rate. As expected, it has been since the establishment of Theonia. A man with financial power, Melses conducted detailed analysis on all aspects of the kingdom, and collected various data at will.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
