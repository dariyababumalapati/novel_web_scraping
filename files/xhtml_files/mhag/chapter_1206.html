   Chapter 1206 Prelude before the war (1)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, today, the Spartan warriors were surprised to see that the Lagnia Bay was filled with densely packed ships, and heavily armed Theonian soldiers continued to get off the ships. The entire coast of Bada is crowded with people. How many soldiers are there?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The shock in their hearts could not be greater. They had seen tens of thousands of Theonia's troops before, and they deeply felt the huge gap in their numbers. They did not expect that this time there would be more Theonia soldiers, and they were by no means just filling the numbers. , because in the eyes of these battle-hardened Spartan warriors, these Theonian soldiers are not only well-armed, but they are also orderly and disciplined, and should have a certain degree of combat effectiveness.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Among the Spartans who saw this scene was Agesilaus. At that moment, his heart suddenly hit the bottom. Despair drowned him like a tide. His body was shaking and he was about to collapse. , was supported by Xenophon, who had quick eyes and quick hands beside him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Don't worry... there is still hope..." Xenophon comforted in a low voice.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus looked at the dark coast and was silent for a long time before he let out a hoarse sigh: "I hope Zeus will bless you..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Xenophon also looked at the bustling coast, although he had already seen Dio. The prosperity of the center of the Kingdom of Theonia, but at this moment he witnessed the power of the Theonia army again, and his mood was also very uneasy. He suddenly remembered what Davos said when he parted with him decades ago. , "He wanted to establish a brand new country in the Western Mediterranean and invited him to join"... Xenophon disagreed at the time, but now it seems that Davos has indeed fulfilled his promise.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, Xenophon suddenly felt a little regretful...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Spartans watched the arrival of the Theonian reinforcements in fear, while Crotokatax, Printors and other stationed generals Happy to welcome the reinforcement generals headed by Patroclus into the city of Sparta.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a general tour of the main sights in the city, a group of people entered the heavily guarded meeting hall and held a military meeting.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotocathus originally wanted Patroclus to sit at the top of the list, because he was the commander-in-chief of this supporting army appointed by King Davos, and the number of soldiers in the reinforcements far exceeded that of Davos stationed in Sparta. Onian army, and they also shoulder an important mission.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Patroclus should be the youngest army commander since the establishment of the Holy Kingdom of Theonia. During the Gallic War, the Roman regional administrator Asistes once commented on him privately, saying that he was "militarily talented. But when you are young and successful, you are inevitably too arrogant and tend to ignore others."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, Patroclus, who has been training in the Po River area for several years and has already passed his thirties, is obviously much calmer than when he first became the commander of the Fourteenth Army. Moreover, after he was transferred back to Thurii, Cynthia, who was in the throes of losing her brother, warned him solemnly many times to make him understand that the current Crotocatacus was no longer the middle-ranking member of the kingdom who worked quietly and hard in Rome. He was an official, but the successor that King Davos was paying attention to, and he was working hard to cultivate his prestige in the military... So he politely rejected Clotokatax's suggestion and insisted on taking the second seat.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After everyone sat down, Crotokatax coughed lightly and said loudly: "First of all, on behalf of the soldiers stationed in Messenia and Laconia, I would like to extend a warm welcome to your arrival! This paragraph Over time, the Greek coalition forces continued to attack us. Although the soldiers held the defense line firmly, they were still under a lot of pressure. Your arrival enhanced their confidence!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax paused and took something from his arms. He wrote a letter and said seriously: "Commander Patroclus handed me a letter written by His Majesty. In his heart, His Majesty praised us for our outstanding performance in the previous battles and for being able to conquer the Greek overlord in such a short period of time. Sparta is a great achievement!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hearing this, Printors, Olivers, Trotilas and others all straightened their chests subconsciously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax's eyes swept across their faces, and finally fell on the somewhat absent-minded Ctissus. He continued in a gentle tone: "His Majesty also mentioned, 'Although we achieved the expected goal, The expeditionary army still paid a high price, but this was inevitable. After all, we were fighting Sparta, which dominated Greece with force, not the weak Tarantum. Many soldiers died in the battle. But this is war!'... His Majesty has experienced hundreds of battles and will not blame anyone for this! On the contrary, he encourages us not to have any worries, continue to unite and fight with all our strength, and ultimately achieve the strategic goals set by the kingdom!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crowe Tokartax's words made the garrison generals feel greatly relieved, especially Ctissus, whose face instantly looked much better.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotocathax saw that what he said had an effect, and he was also happy. He knew very well that the death of Adoris was not only for him, but also for the generals who fought in the Peloponnese. A big stone weighed on his chest, especially Ctissus, whose self-blame was displayed on his face almost every day.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax had no resentment towards Cutissus, only sympathy: when the war situation suddenly changed, he, as the coach, was panicked, but Cutissus was able to take the correct response in a relatively timely manner, thus ensuring that The First Army was not defeated by the Spartans, laying the foundation for the final victory of the battle.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   For this reason, he once talked with Ctissus privately, but the effect was not obvious.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Fortunately, Davos wrote this letter in time. Although the letter did not directly mention Adoris' name, it also made Ctissus feel his understanding and encouragement. Therefore, Ctissus's entire mental state All changed by it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Patroclus watched the scene in front of him silently. When he received the news that Adoris had died in battle, he was indeed shocked and sad, but not as sad as his wife. After all, the relationship between him and Adoris The relationship was not very good. Adoris had an inexplicable hostility towards him, so the two had less contact with each other.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, what surprised him was the change in Clotocathus. A few years ago, when he was the commander of the legions in Rome, he had a close relationship with Clotocathus. In his impression, this young prince He has a gentle, serious, diligent and approachable personality, but when I saw him again today, his words and deeds had a bit of the majesty of a superior.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Commander Patroclus." Clotokatax looked at his brother-in-law and said loudly: "Next, please tell us about the follow-up military plan discussed and formulated by His Majesty and the Ministry of Military Affairs!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Patroklos !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ross came back to his senses, looked around, and said loudly: "Everyone who has been fighting here for more than three months, according to the latest military plan drawn up by His Majesty, you still need to support yourself here for a while, because the army I led The army is not here to reinforce you&#226;&#128;&#148;"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What?!" Upon hearing this, Olivers, Tagetinos and other generals were surprised, while Printors was thoughtful.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Without waiting for them to ask, Patroclus continued: "The Ministry of Military Affairs once conducted a deduction. The Peloponnese Peninsula is not large but has many mountains. If we confront the enemy head-on in Messenia and Laconia, In the battle, the superior force cannot be fully deployed. Although it can repel them, it cannot annihilate them better. On the contrary, the defeated Greek coalition forces retreat to their own city-states, which will inevitably greatly extend the time for us to conquer Greece.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And our army wants to Landing on the flanks of the Greek coalition forces and carrying out a pincer attack on them. Only Ellis is suitable for large-scale landing operations, because our previous conquests of islands such as Zakynthus and Keralonia have already enabled them to strengthen the coast. We have to be prepared, and the Greek coalition forces are just south of Ellis, and reinforcements can arrive at any time. The landing operation there will undoubtedly cost us a lot, and it may not be successful. In&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   addition, the Ministry of Military Affairs has also received intelligence that the Greek coalition forces have strengthened In order to defend the coasts of Attica and Boeotia... But it is useless for them to do this. His Majesty has already set the target of our raid-"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Patroclus emphasized his tone with an expression of admiration. Said: "That's Thessaly! It is reported that among the Greek coalition forces, Thessaly's soldiers account for more than half, and their combat effectiveness is also the strongest. They are the absolute main force of the Greek coalition forces! We must take advantage of the emptiness in its rear to If we send a large army to quickly raid and occupy all of Thessaly, then the Thessalian army that is still fighting here will inevitably collapse without a fight. The Thessalians will retreat, and the Greek coalition will naturally collapse..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Olivers and other generals It dawned on me.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Printors showed a look of understanding and cautiously reminded: "The Greek coalition knows that they are strengthening the defense of the coast in Central Greece, so they will not ignore Thessaly." "Is&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Master Printors right? Yes, the Ministry of Military Affairs has received news from Philae, and Jason has indeed sent troops to strengthen the defense of the southern coast of Philae." For this wise and meritorious chief of staff of the Ministry of Military Affairs, Patroclus Not daring to underestimate him, he explained seriously: "However, our main landing site is not in the east of Thessaly, but in Peleus, the Macedonian territory to the north, and Lamia to the south.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Macedonia did not join the Greek Alliance, But it has lent troops to Sparta and Athens (actually hired), and it is also our enemy of Theonia. The Lamia region was forced to rely on Jason not long ago, and Peleus was far away from the center of Thessaly , they are not strong, and they are not very loyal to Jason, and so far they have not been found to have strengthened their defenses on the coast..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Printors listened while thinking about the geography of the east coast of mainland Greece. After pondering for a while, he asked: "How many soldiers are participating in the landing operation?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "There are the Second Army, the Third Army, the Fifth Army, the Ninth Army, the Tenth Army, and the Eleventh Army. The 12th Legion, the 13th Legion, the 2nd and 3rd Cavalry Legions, the Gallic Brigade (including 6,000 Gallic warriors and 2,000 Gallic cavalry), 2,000 Balearic slingers... they will directly land for combat The number of soldiers reaches 80,000." Patroclus said, and suddenly remembered something: "By the way, including the fleet infantry of the three fleets that escorted us, there are nearly 100,000 combat soldiers in total!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Patroclus After Ross finished speaking, the generals present widened their eyes: 100,000 soldiers were dispatched at once, what a grand scene it would be!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
