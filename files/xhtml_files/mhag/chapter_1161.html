   Chapter 1161 When the brothers&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   said this, Leoticides sneered: "Perhaps in the eyes of the Arcadians, no matter how vicious the Spartans are, they are also their own family; regardless of what we Theonia said What have they lived and done, but they are foreigners from outside. They will be wary of Sparta, but they will be more worried about the true intention of us Theonians suddenly breaking into the Peloponnese..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Krotoka Tuckers pondered for a while and then asked uncertainly: "General, do you think that when Sparta takes the initiative to sue for peace, the Arcadians will reunite with the Spartans and fight against us?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   " This is a conjecture of mine. Otherwise, several days would have passed and the Arcadians still had not sent an envoy... However, the situation in Peloponnese was already very complicated, and I left here for dozens more In 2008, I didn't know much about the current Arcadia region, and my judgment may not be accurate. It is also possible that the Arcadians are willing to cooperate with us and hope that we can help them get rid of Sparta completely." Leoti Chides said cautiously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotocathacus began to feel a little worried: "What if the Arcadians really reconcile with Sparta and don't allow our troops to pass through their territory?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It's simple, ignore them, We directly led the army to force the passage. With such a powerful army, they did not dare to stop us."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides' answer was very firm, but Clotokatax frowned: "But this will arouse the anger of Ah. The dissatisfaction of the Cadians."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "As outsiders, our forcible invasion of the Peloponnese Peninsula has long aroused suspicion and dissatisfaction among these conservative Peloponnesian people. But as long as Sparta is completely defeated, Peloponnese will No matter how dissatisfied the other Pennesian city-states are, they will be overwhelmed by our strength." Leoticides' flat tone was full of disdain.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotocatacus did not quite agree with what Leoticides said, but he did not object vocally, but continued to listen carefully.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Even though Sparta may receive reinforcements from the Persians, it is still relatively easy for us to defeat it head-on with our existing forces, not to mention that your highness has brought a multi-legion group..." Leoticides said straightforwardly asked: "Is this large number of troops just to deal with a Sparta that has greatly declined in strength?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotocathax hesitated for a moment, and quietly glanced at Printors next to him. Linthos nodded slightly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So Clotokatax said frankly: "Defeating Sparta is only our preliminary goal. His Majesty hopes that we can use this victory to unite the Greek city-states, dominate the political situation of the entire Greece, squeeze out the Persians, and make Greece Truly become a powerful barrier for the kingdom!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What Crotokatax said was unexpected by Leoticides. He said seriously: "If the kingdom wants to replace Sparta and become the leader of Greece, it is not So easy. These powerful countries in Greece will not surrender easily, especially Athens. The Athenians, like the Spartans, regard Greece as their own and will not allow external forces to compete for it. Therefore, if they want to complete the tasks assigned by His Majesty , we must make Athens surrender first.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition, we must be careful of the Thebans. Although they are our allies, they will not necessarily support us in controlling Greece... In short, Athens, Thebes, Argos, Corinth... ...etc., including Ellis, don't trust them too much. Your Highness, the only thing you can trust is the powerful army you lead. As long as you win a few more battles, your goal will eventually be achieved."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kolotoka Tuckers was deep in thought for a while before he nodded solemnly: "Thank you, General, for your reminder. I will keep it in mind!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before I leave, I hope your Highness can agree to my request."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Please tell me."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   " My eldest son Tertotis is 17 years old this year and is not yet a minor. This time he came to Messenia as my personal soldier. Originally, I planned to take him to the Spartan territory... But now I can't do it." There was a rare trace of regret on Leoticides's face: "But after he learned about his life experience, he is now unwilling to leave with me and insists on seeing with his own eyes what he called Motherland... So I hope your highness can keep him and satisfy his needs-" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There is no problem. He can stay as my personal soldier and enter Sparta with me in the future." "Klotoka Tuckers agreed immediately.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After seeing off Leoticides, Clotokatax looked at the chief of staff: "Lord Printors, what do you think of what General Proseus said?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Your Highness." Prinn Thors said seriously: "General Proseus not only has strong commanding skills, but also has excellent political capabilities. Whether it was the pacification of the Sikelians or the series of military campaigns in the conquered areas after the conquest of Alpine Gaul, The disposal arrangement quickly stabilized the situation and was consistent with the laws of the kingdom... In addition, he grew up here and has a deeper understanding of Greece than we do. What he said should attract our attention! As he said, since we have no roots in Greece, if we want to dominate the situation in Greece, we will probably have to make more military efforts."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax was thoughtful.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the evening, Adoris came to the camp tent.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax himself came out to greet him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, when Adoris saw him, he immediately performed a military salute: "Adoris, the captain of the third battalion of the First Legion, pays homage to the commander!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax said quickly: "Brother, it's just the two of us, you Stop teasing me!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The kingdom's army is very disciplined. If I see the commander being casual, I will be ridiculed by my colleagues and soldiers tomorrow, and even impeached by the military judge!" Alris He said seriously: As a commander, you must also have the majesty of a commander!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Klotokatax blushed for a while and quickly returned the military salute solemnly. It wasn't&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   until he entered the big battle that Adoris relaxed a little. He looked at the empty military tent and saw the banquet placed in the middle. Said: "Klotto, you asked me to come to the banquet?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I have been in Rome for the past few years, and we brothers haven't seen each other for a long time!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Let's have a good gathering today!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Klotokatax said emotionally.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It's okay to have a party, but we must first agree not to drink.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Adoris reminded.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Don't worry, as the commander, I will not take the lead in making mistakes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   " Clotokatax smiled and invited Adoris to sit at the table.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I really didn't expect you, Croto, to become the new commander! I have been in the army for so many years, and I haven't become the commander of the army yet!" Adoris sighed after sitting down.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I didn't expect that I would become the commander!" Crotokatax responded with some embarrassment: "Maybe my father had his own considerations... Anyway, it was Chief of Staff Printors who actually made plans and issued orders. and several legion commanders, so don't worry..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Croto!" Adoris looked at him and said angrily: "Since you are already the commander, you must shoulder the responsibilities of the commander. The lives of thousands of soldiers are in your hands. This is no child's play. You must cheer up, seriously consider their suggestions, and carefully issue correct orders. Only then can you live up to your father's expectations!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Big Brother taught me a lesson !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Yes!" Clotokatax quickly admitted his mistake: "I will try my best to be an army commander, but I hope to get your support, big brother!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Of course I will support you!" Adoris answered without hesitation : "As long as you don't mess around, I will mobilize all the soldiers of the First Legion to support you!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Thank you, brother!" Clotokatax scooped a bowl of chicken soup for Adoris and asked: "K General Tissus became the commander of the First Legion. How is the situation?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The Ministry of Military Affairs appointed the right candidate!" Adoris took a sip of soup and said slightly excitedly: "Two hours ago Keti Suess went to the headquarters of our First Army Corps and convened a meeting with team officers above the level of company captain. The scene turned out to be lively! Did you know that more than half of the 8 captains and 40 company captains were his subordinates back then? Soldiers, everyone gathered around him and called him "Sir"... It was only the first time they met, and the First Legion was already under the control of Ctissus."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax saw his envious look and thought for a moment Then he asked: "How is the morale of the soldiers now?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Very good... not very good either." Adoris gave this contradictory answer, and then explained: "The soldiers of the First Legion are We were very eager to compete with the Spartans and prove that our First Legion was the most powerful warrior in the Mediterranean. But when they landed in Messenia, the Spartans retreated, which disappointed the soldiers. They were eager to invade Sparta's territory and conquer the city-state that had dominated Greece for decades, but now they have stayed in Messenia, helping the Messenians build cities and houses... despite getting Messenia People are grateful, but the soldiers still have a lot of complaints in their hearts..." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I believe that their wishes will come true soon." Clotokatax said, remembering something, and took something from his arms. Send out several letters: "This is a letter from my sister-in-law and sister (Cynthia). They have been going to the main temple of Hades to pray every day during this period. They hope that Hades will protect you and return safely."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Adoris took the letter. Without looking, he stuffed it into his arms and said seriously: "Klotto, there is something I must remind you. You can't refuse to send me important military missions just because I am your brother. I led the company to the battlefield... If you want to do that, I will not recognize you as a brother!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thanks to Windblown Summer for the reward!&#13;
