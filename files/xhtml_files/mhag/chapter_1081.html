   Chapter 1081 Promotion and Authorization&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I think Patroclus will make more use of the 500 mountain reconnaissance brigade soldiers in his hands. They are the key to the decisive victory."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The officers watching the battle were talking quietly, while the two protagonists on the scene were still staring at the map and thinking hard.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, Tormid said again: "I declare that the tactical assessment has officially begun!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Dang!" A crisp bell rang, and the two protagonists stood up at the same time and took a few steps back. Ten soldiers carried several wide wooden boards into the field, and erected them on top of the wooden map, blocking the two from seeing the whole picture. Of course, Sextus has the advantage of defense. He can see a wider area of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;the map, while Patroclus's sight is limited to the southwest corner of the map.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Several tactical executors also stood next to the two protagonists holding tactical chess pieces. These tactical chess pieces were small wooden sculptures such as heavy infantry, light infantry, javelinmen, and cavalry. When they were placed on the map, they made serious people look at them. The tactical assessment has a bit of game fun.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, Matonis picked up two dice and rolled a "7". After the referees picked up the form for comparison, they loudly said: "Day 1, heavy rain!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After listening, the two protagonists thought about it and used white pens to write down the measures they took on the first day on the small wooden boards they carried with them. Then the executor took their wooden boards to the referee's seat.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The referees read the order given on the board and ruled that it was feasible.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So, the executioner followed the orders on the board and began to place tactical chess pieces on the map.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mattonis rolled the die again, then glanced at Patroclus and said loudly: "Heavy rain on the second day!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There was a small commotion among the surrounding officers watching the battle, but Patroclus's expression did not change. After thinking about it, he wrote down his decision again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just when most of the officers in the Turiyi Military Camp gathered in the tactical drill room to watch the two men conduct an assessment, King Davos, accompanied by Alexis, the Minister of Military Affairs, came to the Turiyi Military Camp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After receiving the news, the commander of the First Army, Leotychides, hurried to greet them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After learning that a tactical assessment was being conducted in the military camp, Davos asked Leotychides not to inform them for the time being, and he took the guards to the military conference room to wait.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Proseus, who do you think will win?&#226;&#128;&#157; Davos chatted with Leotychides while they were idle.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Patroclus has a flexible mind and decisive and bold actions; Sextus is careful, steady and calm. Both of them are excellent officers. According to the information I have received, in this assessment, Sextus Stus is in charge of defense and Patroclus is in charge of offense. This distribution is in line with their fighting style. However, when fighting in mountainous areas, defense has an advantage. If Patroclus wants to win, I am afraid he will need a little luck."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, in war, luck is an important factor in determining victory or defeat, and it has to be decided by the gods. But in the assessment, it has to be decided by the luck of the dice referee..." Davos said jokingly He said a sentence, and then changed the subject: "What do you think about whether to send legions to the border to build fortress defense this time?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, I think there is no problem in sending various legions to take turns to station at the border for more than half a year. In fact, each legion does not stay at the border for a long time, and there are nearly 20 legions in the kingdom. It takes at least a few rounds to take turns. Years later, besides, these legionnaires have multiple slaves at home, and their families have enough labor to take care of the housework..." Leotychides answered without hesitation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Henepolis curled his lips aside and cursed in his heart: Of course you, Proseus, would say that. In your eyes, is there anything else besides military affairs? Since you became the commander of the First Army Corps, the citizens of the entire Turiyi Region have been complaining about your harassment, and they have nicknamed you "Iron Man"...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked like he was listening carefully and nodded from time to time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The two chatted for a long time. Davos seemed to remember something and asked, "Proseus, you haven't been back home in the past six months, have you?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leotychides was stunned for a moment, then replied: "Your Majesty, I have just taken over the First Legion and want to get familiar with this legion as soon as possible, so..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos waved his hand and persuaded with concern: "Don't be too anxious. Judging from the current situation, there will be no major war in the kingdom in a short time, and the First Army will not be sent to the battlefield in a short time. You have plenty of time to get familiar with the First Army. You still have to take time to go back and spend time with your family! Your home is in the city of Turii, not far away. You haven't even gone back to visit it once in half a year. Your family has Went to the Military Affairs Department! Those who don't know the situation might think that it was me, Davos, who imprisoned you here. I don't want to suffer this injustice!&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos said jokingly, then patted Leotychides on the shoulder, and said in a gentle but irresistible tone: "Tomorrow you can go home and rest for a few days to relax yourself. , and let the soldiers relax, okay?!&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides hesitated for a while, then reluctantly said: "Yes, Your Majesty."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "That's right, you have to know how to combine work and rest!&#226;&#128;&#157; Davos smiled.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hennepolis's lips curled up slightly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While the two were talking, Martius, the palace guard chief, walked into the military conference room: "Your Majesty, the tactical assessment has ended."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Who won?&#226;&#128;&#157; Henipolis asked curiously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Sextus won." Martius reported to the equally curious Davos: "Patroclus had bad luck. It rained heavily for several days before the battle began, which prevented his army from crossing the river. , but he still insisted on letting the engineering camp build the bridge to attract Sextus' army to block it on the other side. However, he secretly divided some troops to build rafts in the upper reaches of the river and risked forcibly crossing the river.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Sextus arranged many sentries to monitor the upper river bank and discovered this situation, and he quickly sent troops to stop it, the referee's bench ruled that due to the distance, Sextus' army Couldn't get there in time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Patroclus's army successfully crossed the river, many soldiers drowned due to the swollen river water. Sextus decisively led the army to retreat back to the mountains. Patroclus immediately established a defensive camp on the other side of the river, and it took several days for the entire army to cross the river. In the process of marching towards the mountains, his army was constantly harassed by the Samnite light infantry sent by Sextus, which slowed down their advance.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sextus used this time to build a simple defensive fortress on a dangerous terrain on the only way, and hoarded heavy troops. The two sides launched a fierce offensive and defensive battle here. Due to the narrow mountain road, Patroclus' superior force could not be fully deployed. Moreover, at the critical moment, heavy rain was thrown many times, seriously affecting Patroclus's attack, so the time When it ended, his army still failed to break through the blockade.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, he secretly sent 1,000 soldiers, mainly composed of mountain reconnaissance soldiers, to sneak attack the main camp of Sextus' army by climbing mountains and going around trails. However, because Sextus' main force was still there, Patlock Rose's rations had been exhausted, so the referee's bench finally ruled that Sextus won... However, based on the performance of both sides, the referees unanimously ruled that both of them passed the tactical assessment. "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After listening carefully, Davos said with emotion: "Although it was just talk on paper, it also made them realize the difficulty of fighting in the mountainous area! ... However, since this tactical assessment is based on the Samonai Mountains as the background , then have the magistrates considered that sending troops to fight should avoid the spring rainy season?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I asked Tormid and he said that the combat time is set in summer. Therefore, when designing the form, only two of the 12 weather options were related to rain, namely light rain and heavy rain. However, during the assessment, many The worst of the three throws."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Martius finished speaking, Davos was also a little surprised. After a moment, he shrugged and said: "This just shows that the vagaries of war are beyond our control. I think today's tactical assessment is very good, very good Taught them a lesson..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As Davos was talking, noisy footsteps could be heard outside the door.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos stopped talking, took his exclusive helmet from Henipolis, and put it on his head.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Minister of Military Affairs Alexis led Chief of Staff Tormid, Commander of the Second Army Matonis and other generals into the conference room. After saluting Davos respectfully, they stood aside one after another.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then Patroclus and Sextus came in. They already knew what was going to happen next, so they looked very excited. After saluting Davos, they stood upright.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked around the room, and then said solemnly: "Let's get started."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alexis, the Minister of Military Affairs, took a step forward, unfolded the papyrus scroll tied with a black cloth strip in his hand, and read aloud: "In view of the fact that Patroclus and Sextus have outstanding military exploits in the past and passed the general's examination with excellent results. After the official assessment, His Majesty King Davos and the Ministry of Military Affairs discussed and decided to promote the two to the rank of legion commander!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as his voice paused, there were cheers all around, and Patroclus also had smiles on their nervous faces.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alexis continued: "And Patroclus was appointed commander of the fourteenth legion (mainly the Latium region), and Sextus was appointed commander of the eighteenth legion (southern Iberia), and they immediately went Go to your post without delay!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Felicius and others on the side were a little surprised: it was reasonable for the two of them to be promoted to legion commanders, but it was rare in recent years to be given practical duties immediately after promotion!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
