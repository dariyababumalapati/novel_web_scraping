   Chapter 1156: Heart-to-heart talk between father and son&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   . Antbris had no choice but to shut up in embarrassment.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Unexpectedly, Kristoya's roar frightened Crotokatax's little son, who was only over one year old, and he burst into tears.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Mother, can you speak softer?!" Dido, who was feeding the child, suddenly said dissatisfied.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   If Dido had always spoken to her in this way, Christoya would have been dissatisfied, but now seeing her beloved grandson crying, she suddenly felt guilty and quickly said with concern: "Be careful. Don't let him choke!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Eunice burst into laughter.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kristoya turned to look at her: "You are a married woman, and you are not serious all day long!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Mother, what you said is wrong! I have been busy in the Chamber of Commerce during the day, and I am exhausted. , I finally relaxed while having dinner, and I still have to be criticized by you. It's too stressful. How about I quit from tomorrow and enjoy myself at home?!" Eunice immediately expressed her dissatisfaction.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kristoya was speechless for a moment, and turned to look at Anteblis: "How old are you, and you are still single! At your age, your eldest and second brothers are already married and have children! How many senior ministers have come to visit? I proposed marriage to you, but you rejected me. You train and train every day. Do you just want to get married with rugby?!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Grandma, my classmates at school said that my brother-in-law is very good at playing rugby, and they admire him very much!" Cynthia The eldest son interjected loudly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Stop talking and eat well!" Cynthia quickly scolded her son in a low voice.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Anteblis was very proud of being praised by the younger generation, but when he saw Crystal glaring at him, he quickly acted aggrieved: "Mother, I don't always follow your request. Have we met? However, it is true that I was not hit by Eros' golden arrow. There is nothing I can do about it. Besides, I am not the only one who is not married. Aviya is not young either. Isn't she also married? !"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aviya, who was having a quiet meal, suddenly blushed: "Third brother, you-I...I..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Little Ant, you bullied Aviya again!" Eunice immediately scolded loudly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Hey, I told you, don't call me that!" Briantes yelled dissatisfied.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Are you two done?" Clotokatax finally couldn't help but said loudly: "Can you have a quiet meal?! If anyone messes around again, he should go out first!" The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   restaurant suddenly became quiet, especially Nice and Briantes both bowed their heads to eat in a dignified manner.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked at it and nodded secretly in his heart: several years of hard work have made the eldest son who was once gentle in character become majestic.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You also go back to your seats and finish your dinner properly." Clotokatax said to the children gathered around Briantes. Although his attitude was gentle, except for His own child, Christophe, the other children paid no attention to.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, Apox said to them: "Hurry up and finish your dinner. I will let Uncle Ant continue to tell you his story later, okay?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay!!" The children immediately ran back to themselves. seats.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Second brother, you are still awesome." Clotokatax praised.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Apox smiled: "Brother, you have been away from Turiyi for many years, and the children are not familiar with you. As time goes by, they will listen to you."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The two looked at each other and smiled.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After dinner, just when the moon was rising and the stars were twinkling, Christoya asked the servants to light candles in the yard and chatted with Agnes, Cynthia, Eunice, Aviya, and Nelia. (Apox's wife) and Molina were chatting in the pavilion in the garden, while the children gathered around Briantes and listened to his vivid stories... The whole yard was laughing constantly, creating a harmonious and lively scene.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Apox returned to his mansion alone and continued his research during the day.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotokatax was called to the study by Davos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I haven't had a good chat with you since you came back." Davos motioned for his son to sit down, and then asked pleasantly: "Have you been getting used to the past few days since you returned to Turiyi?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Can you come back ?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Dido and I are very happy to live with you, your two mothers, and your brothers and sisters at home." Clotokatax paused and said frankly: "It's just that I feel a little too idle. I feel a little uncomfortable."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It seems you still have some complaints." Davos said in a serious tone. Seeing that his son was eager to explain, he waved his hand and said with a smile: "I originally wanted you to rest for a few days. After a few days, assist me in managing state affairs, but today Henepolis gave me a proposal..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotokatax saw Davos suddenly silenced, and did not ask in a hurry. After a while, he saw Davos Still silent, he asked: "What is the suggestion?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos did not respond immediately, but asked instead: "What do you think of the kingdom sending troops to the Peloponnese?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotokatax was serious. After thinking about it for a while, he said calmly: "Although this time is different from previous wars, we took the initiative to send troops, but in fact Sparta has been hostile to us for a long time. During the Western Mediterranean War, the entire Apu The invasion of the Spartan region was caused by the Spartans secretly. Taking advantage of the favorable opportunity of the decline of the Spartans' power, we sent troops to completely eradicate this hidden danger, which is good for the security of the kingdom.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "And although Sparta is The overlord of Greece itself, but Greece has always been prone to frequent wars, and it is the culprit.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Greece and the Kingdom are separated by a small Adriatic Sea. In the long run, Greece with constant wars will not be of any benefit to the Kingdom. By conquering Sparta this time, we can gradually intervene in the political situation of Greece and eventually dominate Greece. To restore peace and prosperity, thereby thwarting the Persian conspiracy, and making Greece a powerful barrier to the east of the kingdom..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos was very happy after hearing this: "That's very good!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It seems that you have not only been immersed in heavy tasks in recent years, but also paid close attention to the situation around the kingdom, and have thought carefully and have your own opinions, which is good!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotocatacus was a little embarrassed: "In Rome, I was sometimes invited to attend banquets by Lord Asistes, and I learned a lot from him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It's also good to be good at learning from others, and then transforming useful things into your own!" Davos nodded appreciatively, and then asked: "Do you think we can defeat the Peloponnese this time? Sparta?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotocattak answered without hesitation: "We can definitely return in triumph!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Oh, so confident?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Father, the Gallic army invaded Etrunia a few years ago. At that time, the people in Rome were in panic, and so was I. But not long after, not only was the Gallic army wiped out, but even the entire Gaul region in the mountains was conquered by us." Crotokatax said passionately: "Although Pa Brother Troclus played a big role in the entire war, but at that time I was in Rome collecting food and supplies for the army, and I became more deeply aware of how powerful the kingdom was. At the beginning of the war, the&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   food and armaments shipped from the south Supplies quickly filled the warehouses of the city of Rome, and an army of 100,000 troops was quickly formed and transported by countless ships. They successfully landed in the territory of the Gauls. The Gauls, who were feared by the various forces in central and northern Italy, came within a short time. They were conquered by us in just a few months...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So although the Spartans' bravery has long been famous in the Eastern Mediterranean, their territory is far less than that of the Gauls, and their population is far less than that of the Gauls. We and Sparta's war is more like a duel between adults and children. How long it will take to conquer it depends on how much power we invest." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Yes, the key to winning or losing a war depends on the strength of the country!" Dai Firth was a little surprised. He didn't expect that Crotocactus had glimpsed the essence of war through the Gallic War. This made him greatly relieved and felt that his previous decision to take root in Rome was correct.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, the smile on his face became even brighter and he said: "Henepolis suggested that you be the commander of the expedition to Greece. What do you think?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotokatax asked in surprise: "The commander of that army is not Proseus?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Proseus is the son of Agis, the former king of Sparta. After Agesilaus succeeded to the throne, he fled to Theonia to hide his name. This time he led the army to go to war. , was recognized in Messenia, and all the generals and soldiers in the army knew about it. Now the morale of the army is fluctuating. He himself also proposed to me that he wanted to resign as commander. Soon the Ministry of Military Affairs will transfer him back to Tu. Lii."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Father, General Proseus has lived in the kingdom for more than 20 years and has made great military exploits. You cannot treat him just because he is a prince of Sparta-" "Don't&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   worry, Proseus' Everything has its own conclusion. What we are talking about now is your business, don't change the subject." Davos said unceremoniously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotocatacus had to face the problem directly. He hesitated for a while before he said frankly: "Father, the only time I have been on the battlefield was when I conquered Rome many years ago. Until now, I have not even been able to go to war." I have never been a captain, how can I command tens of thousands of soldiers and convince them? Father, I am not you... I do not have the ability to command an army to win every battle, and I am not suitable to be the commander-in-chief of the army. This will make the people What a joke."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos listened carefully, and when his son finished speaking, he said in a gentle tone: "I will tell you a story... There is a vast kingdom in the far east, but due to the incompetence of the king, this There was civil strife in the kingdom, and two forces came to compete for the throne. The leader of one force was a victorious general, while the leader of the other force was a rogue man from a peasant background. Every time he led his army and fought against The general failed in all battles, but in the end he defeated the general's forces, became the king, and established a more powerful kingdom..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
