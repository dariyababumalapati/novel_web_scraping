   Chapter 1159 The new commander,&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotocathax, who was entrusted by Davos, obviously did not have this idea. He first walked up to Leoticides, solemnly gave him a military salute, and then spoke sincerely. said: "General Proseus, thank you for your contribution to the kingdom! My father understands your request to resign as commander and hopes that you will not take it too seriously! He also asked me I bring you a letter written by him."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After saying that, he took out the letter from his arms with a slightly exaggerated movement and slowly handed it to Leoticides.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This scene was seen and heard by the people around him, especially the army generals who immediately understood one thing: even though it was confirmed that "Proseus was the prince of Sparta", he still He did not lose the respect of King Davos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the visit of Agesilaus, with the connivance of some people, some news spread in the army, which made the morale of the army somewhat unstable. Even if Leoticides tried his best to rectify it, the effect was not very good, because There are rumors that Proseus will be removed from his position as commander and return to his country to undergo investigation and punishment.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now it seems that this rumor is only half correct. General Proseus still has the respect of His Majesty the King, which can at least reassure the soldiers of the First Army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There was a slight fluctuation on Leo's dull face when he mentioned it. He took the letter and said, "Thank you for your majesty's trust! I hope everything goes well for your majesty in the next battle!" "The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   general has outstanding achievements and is familiar with the Peloponnese. Regarding Caesar's situation, I still have many things to ask the general for advice!" Clotokatax said sincerely.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay." Leoticides nodded politely.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax turned to the commander of the Fourth Army and said with the same sincerity: "Uncle Olivers, this is my first time as commander. I hope to get your help!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Agesilaus's visit, Olivers saw a glimmer of hope that he could take over as commander, but when the envoy from the Ministry of Military Affairs arrived in Messenia before the fleet and announced the new appointment to everyone, the commander of the legion, who was a friend of Davos in adversity, immediately understood I understood His Majesty the King's intentions and quickly adjusted my mentality.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, he said with a smile: "Don't worry, Your Highness Cloteau, I will try my best to assist you!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Thank you, Uncle Olivers!" After Cloteau Kataks expressed his thanks, he turned to the sixth Legion Commander: "Commander of Trotilas Legion, I am very happy to fight alongside you -"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before Crotokatax could finish his words, Trotilas quickly performed a military salute and said loudly: " Your Highness, please rest assured that I will strictly abide by military laws and carry out your orders!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Trotilas was also one of Menon's mercenary soldiers back then, he was not in the company to which Davos belonged, so he did not have the same skills as Hilos and Martonis and Olivers also established a deep friendship with Davos during their time in Persia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, he himself is very content. He believes that compared to those comrades who died, were disabled, and retired, being able to have his current status is the greatest blessing Hades has given him. Even when Geogris retired and military affairs When the ministry wanted to promote him to commander of the Fifth Army, he refused and stayed in Xiliting.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Nowadays, he doesn't have much idea about the position of commander. Even if the commander is Clotokatax, who has no military experience, he firmly believes that King Davos, who has led them to fight countless victories, is definitely not the commander. This appointment was made indiscriminately.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After receiving the face-to-face promise from the two commanders of the expeditionary force, it would be much easier for Crotokatax to take over the army. He walked towards Tisias in a happy mood.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Tisias saw Clotokatax approaching, he immediately bowed respectfully and saluted: "Your Highness!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax quickly supported him: "Thank you for your hard work, Lord Tisias! Father, let me I brought him a message, and these were his actual words, 'After you arrive in Messenia, you must go to see Tisias and tell him that he has done a good job in the tasks assigned by the kingdom! I hope he will lead others. The citizens of Theonia continue to work hard to make Messenia develop faster and better, so that it will not only become Theonia's strongest ally in Greece, but also a very powerful ally! If it can If you do this, the kingdom will not forget their contribution!'..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Tisias turned around and said excitedly to everyone: "Did you all hear that, this is what your Majesty has done to us? Affirmation of our achievements! His Majesty also encouraged us to build Messenia even better!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The King of Theonia is victorious!!" The parliamentarians of the former citizens of Theonia shouted excitedly, which also attracted those local people. Messenian MPs echoed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While the Messenian parliamentarians headed by Tisias enthusiastically reported the situation in Messenia to Crotocatacus, Olivers and Trotilas also communicated with Ctissus and Pluto Erns, the commander of the 1st Cavalry Corps, Cuccius, and the commander of the 7th Corps, Tagetinos, met.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Printoles, I will be entrusting you with assisting His Highness in handling military affairs." Although Printoles is the chief of staff and is higher in rank than Olivers, Olivers considers himself a veteran in the army. Therefore, the words have a preaching tone.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Printors did not seem to be dissatisfied with this, but said humbly: "No, Master Olivers, I can't do it alone. This requires all of us to discuss and work together to finally achieve the goal." Victory in this expedition to Greece!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Olivers was startled, his face slightly red. Previously, the Ministry of Military Affairs sent a new appointment. After he learned that Chief of Staff Printols had become the temporary staff officer of this army, he understood that it was obviously His Majesty. If he was asked to escort Crotokartax, he would inevitably feel a little jealous.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, this senior official of the Kingdom's Ministry of Military Affairs, who was more than ten years younger than him, not only took the initiative to discuss with everyone, but also showed respect in his address in accordance with the requirements of military law. This made Olivers himself too stingy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just when he was still hesitating whether to make up for it, he heard Printors say again: "Although His Highness lacks military experience, he is very smart and calm-minded. With the blessing of Hades, he has the ability to become a leader." The talent of an excellent commander. And before leaving, His Majesty repeatedly told me that I can provide various suggestions to His Highness and even criticize and correct the orders he wants to issue, but it is best not to exercise command power on his behalf!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Oliver !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Si's heart trembled, and he was silent for a moment. He glanced at Printors and said to the person behind him: "Ctissus, I didn't expect that you would be the one to take over as the commander of the first legion!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Neither did I. To think that I have already retired, but I was called back by the Military Affairs Office to become the commander of the First Army! Mr. Olivers, you know, I am not willing to be the leader of this army. There are too many troubles. Fortunately, it is just Temporary." Ctisus spread his hands and said with a teasing smile: "But I am still very happy to be the commander of the first legion, in front of you."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The reason why Ctissus dared to joke like this was because he had a good relationship with Olivers. In his early years, he was under the command of Martonis. He was lazy by nature, which troubled the strict Martonis, and he had always been against Martonis. From time to time, Olivers quietly sent people to encourage Curtisus to continue doing this...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Olivers actually laughed and cursed: "Well, you Curtisus, a temporary commander of the First Army will make your tail rise to the sky. La! With your retired body, can you lead the First Legion well?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You are two years older than me. If you can, of course I can too." Ctissus retorted.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You kid...you are so stubborn right now, wait until I catch you up tonight and see if I don't win you over!" Olivers scolded with a smile.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ctissus stopped talking because he was too drunk.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Lord Olivers, am I included in the banquet tonight?!" Tigetinos, commander of the Seventh Army, interjected.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the Western Mediterranean War, Tagtilos led the 9th Army to conquer the entire island of Sardinia. Although the 3rd Fleet played a big role in this, Tagtilos still played an indispensable role, so after the war Davos had planned to transfer Tagtilos to the Ministry of Military Affairs to replace the aging Hieronymus as the military training officer, but he refused. He preferred to stay in the army, so Davos had to Promote him to a higher-ranking legion as much as possible (according to the kingdom's military tradition, the higher-up the legion commander's status in the army, of course, this does not mean that the combat effectiveness of his legion is higher), At this time, the commander of the Seventh Army, Zantiparis, died of illness, and Tegtilosje took over.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Soon after, Geogris was persuaded by Davos to serve as quartermaster, and the position of commander of the Fifth Legion was vacated.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Ministry of Military Affairs once again issued a document asking Tagetinos to take over, but he refused. He said: When I first arrived in Lochry, the soldiers were transferred away before they recognized their true identity. It was like being a deserter. I'll talk about it after I've decided to be the commander of the Seventh Army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the end, the Ministry of Military Affairs had no choice but to let Melishanda, the former commander of the Tenth Army, become the commander of the Fifth Army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Of course I have you, how could I miss this barrel of yours!" Olivers smiled, and then turned to Trotilas and said: "This time is really rare. The four army commanders gathered in Messenia are all Comrades who were in Persia back then, the four of us will have dinner and drink together tonight to talk about the past!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Trotilas glanced at Crotocathax, who was chatting with Tisias not far away, and said softly Said: "It's okay to have dinner together, but it's best not to drink. Although the army is not fighting during this period, we are still in a state of war. Drinking is prohibited. What's more, just after His Highness arrived, several of our army commanders gathered together to drink. This I'm afraid..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
