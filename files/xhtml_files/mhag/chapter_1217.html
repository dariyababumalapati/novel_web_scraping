   Chapter 1217 The Surrender of Pharsalus&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Polydorus had a gentle and steady personality and a kind attitude towards the soldiers. The citizen soldiers recognized him as a commander. His death was very strange, which made the soldiers suspicious.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Asidamas and the other six ministers were all very famous people in several large city-states in Thessaly. They were specially selected by Jason to help him unify the entire Thessaly region. Polyfulon was killed on an unfounded charge. How could this not make the citizen soldiers from various city-states angry? They were just afraid of Polyfulon's power and temporarily tolerated it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the fierce and fast attack of the Theonian soldiers led to an unfavorable situation in the battle, the Thessalian soldiers who had no strong fighting spirit quickly gave up the fight and chose to escape. There were even Philae citizen soldiers who were dissatisfied with Polyfulon's actions and rebelled against the army. Killed Polyfulon who was also fleeing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The whole army in Thessaly was defeated, and the soldiers had no restraint, and each wanted to escape back to their home state. They fled in all directions, causing the entire area to be full of defeated troops, which seemed to be somewhat detrimental to the post-war pursuit of the Theonian army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Matonis and Lizaru did not expect that the Thessalian army would be defeated so quickly, but they both thought that the victory in this battle would help them capture the city of Philae as soon as possible, which may have been completely empty of defenses, and completely eliminate Dio The problem of food supply for the Nian army was originally the purpose of their march eastward, so the two ordered the light armored soldiers, light infantry brigade and cavalry regiments who did not contribute much in the battle but were still physically strong not to pursue the defeated troops, but to hurry up. Towards Philae.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While the armies of Martonis and Lizaru were fighting with the Thessalian army in the northern plains, Patroclus had already led The army crossed the mountains and entered the equally flat southern plain of Thessaly. Regardless of fatigue, the soldiers continued to march toward the hilly areas in the northeast, and by the afternoon they arrived at Pharsalus, the center of the southern plain.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before the Theonian army landed in the Gulf of Mariakos, the Lamians had sent messengers to ask for help from Pharsalus. Therefore, the Pharsalus were somewhat prepared for the arrival of the Theonian army. They even He also sent a messenger to Philae for help, but by the time the messenger arrived at Philae, Polyfulon had already led his army to Larissa, and what he got turned out to be "Assi, which was respected by the people of Pharsalus." The news that Damas was killed had not yet been sent back to the city-state.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The people of Pharsalus did not expect that the Theonian army would come so quickly and in such large numbers. The citizen soldiers looked down from the city and could only see the endless black surging, which was frightening. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The city of Pharsalus was built on a hill. It had already been prepared in advance, and it was already late. In addition, the Theonian soldiers had been marching for a long time and lacked physical strength, so Patroclus ordered the army to be close to France. They camped and rested less than a mile from the city of Salus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   With such a close distance between the two sides, it was easy for them to be attacked, but Patroclus, with his overwhelmingly superior force, not only did not worry, but was happy to see the outcome.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But just when the soldiers began to dig trenches and build camps, he received a report from the reconnaissance cavalry: there were many Thessaly troops in the north.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Patroclus thought for a moment, he immediately issued an order: let some of the troops who were building the camp immediately surround the city of Pharsalus to prevent any broken troops from escaping into the city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, cavalry legions, light infantry, and light armor troops were sent to hunt down Thessaly's defeated troops.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   These Thessaly troops who had been running away for several hours thought they had escaped the pursuit of the Theonian army, but unexpectedly they ran into another huge Theonian army head-on. This extremely tired pair of them It was a big blow to them, and many of them simply chose to surrender.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before dusk, the pursuit was coming to an end. The Theonian army captured nearly 2,000 Thessalian soldiers, most of whom were Pharsalus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Through interrogating them, Patroclus learned about the general actions of Martonis and Lizaru's troops in the north in the past few days, which not only helped them successively attack Peleus and Larissa, but also defeated the main force of Thessaly. He was happy with the results, but also reminded himself to speed up military operations to avoid the loss of his prestige due to too few achievements when the two armies met, even though he had taken the initiative to land on the most difficult southern coast.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, Patroclus selected 5 prisoners with higher status and certain reputation from the captured troops of Pharsalus. He first gathered the army and asked these prisoners to follow him to inspect the tens of thousands of high-spirited soldiers. soldiers, and then called the guide to Lamia to explain to him that "the Theonian army has occupied Lamia, Heraclea, and Thermopylae in the south.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After that, Patroclus then Officially talk to them and tell them clearly: Theonia has sent 100,000 troops to attack Thessaly. The main force of its army is far away in the Peloponnese. The city-states of Thessaly will definitely be difficult to resist, but as long as France Salus surrendered to Theonia. He could swear in the name of Hades, the protector of the Kingdom of Theonia, that the Theonia army would not harm the people of Pharsalus and would not plunder the people's property at will. But if Pharsalus still refuses to surrender before dawn, he will execute more than 2,000 Pharsalus prisoners, and then lead the army to attack the city of Pharsalus. After capturing the city, all the Pharsalus people will Become a slave of Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Soon, Patroclus let the captives who served as messengers enter the city of Pharsalus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The captives hurried to the Pharsalus Council to express their gratitude to the MPs who had not yet left. Conveyed the request of the Theonians, and also told them what happened in Thessaly these days.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The members of Pharsalus were shocked after hearing this: The Theonians actually sent a mission to conquer Thessaly. An army of 100,000 people came (although the captives answered in the affirmative based on the number of Theonian troops they saw in the southern and northern plains of Thessaly, the MPs still had doubts about such a huge number. There is some doubt), and has captured Peleus, Larissa, Lamia, Heraclea, and Thermopylae (this information is less doubtful). As for the Thessalian League, not only did Polidolu, the temporary commander-in-chief, He was murdered, and the only defensible army in Thessaly had just suffered a disastrous defeat in the battle. What made the Pharsalus people even more angry was that their backbone, the respected Archidamas, was actually killed by Polyfulon. Executed as a traitor...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The invasion of the Theonian army has become irresistible, and the Jason family is not trustworthy. Where should Pharsalus go?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At dusk, the bells in Pharsalus rang, and the MPs urgently A citizens' meeting was held. As one of the most powerful states in Thessaly, there were less than 2,000 citizens participating in the meeting, and less than 500 young and middle-aged citizens. Most of its citizens have either become prisoners of Theonia or are still in Ia. In the army led by Song.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, the citizens of Pharsalus had been frightened by the huge Theonian army outside the city, and now they learned that the enemy was stronger than what they had seen, and We are already isolated and helpless, so the vast majority of citizens agree to surrender to Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The citizens' assembly quickly passed a resolution. They declared to the outside world that the reason for passing the resolution was to save the lives of compatriots outside the city, and to prevent the destruction of Pharsalus (after all, the Tegeans betrayed the covenant and were eventually defeated by Dionysus). The tragedy that Asia was completely destroyed and turned into an empty city has spread throughout Greece due to the efforts of thoughtful people, and the people of Pharsalus do not want to repeat the same mistake).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   That night, Pharsalus sent an envoy out of the city to discuss surrender with the Theonian army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Among the powerful states in Thessaly, Philae is relatively special. It is surrounded by rugged hills and is limited by the terrain. Its urban area is not large, and there is no flat and fertile land in its territory. The reason why it is rich depends on maritime trade. Especially after Jason became the tyrant of Philae, he vigorously expanded the port, making the port area even larger. It accounts for almost half of the entire city, so it is difficult to completely separate it from the main city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There were more than a dozen cargo ships moored at a pier in the port. A fat middle-aged man staggered towards the pier. While burping with wine, he greeted the owners of nearby merchant ships until he approached. When he reached the innermost ship among the dozens of cargo ships, he stopped and pretended to be drunk. However, after taking the opportunity to scan around quietly and finding nothing unusual, he staggered and jumped. Got on the boat and wandered into the cabin.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Compared to the crew members lying on the deck who were sleeping soundly, there were three people sitting in the small cabin, discussing something in a low voice.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Captain, I'm back!" the sailor who jumped on board whispered.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The man called the captain is about 40 years old, with an unusually burly physique. There are several conspicuous scars on his face and body. He exudes a Hittite aura in his movements. He is the mountain range of the Sacred Kingdom of Theonia. The current captain of the reconnaissance group&#226;&#128;&#148;Tegtus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Why did Tegetus, who was supposed to fight in the Peloponnese with Crotokatax, appear in the port of Philae?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It turns out that the Mountain Reconnaissance Brigade was an important part of the military plan formulated by the Ministry of Military Affairs for the landing and assault on Thessaly. Since the landing army must capture Thessaly as soon as possible to alleviate the problem of tight food supply, how to successfully capture Thessaly? Philae, the center of the country, became a top priority.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sending a small group of troops to infiltrate in advance and cooperate with the main siege force inside and outside is an important means for the Theonian army to capture the city in previous wars, and the Mountain Reconnaissance Brigade happens to be the best at this tactic. It has made many decisions because of this. This was a military achievement, so he was assigned the responsibility of infiltrating Philae.&#13;
