   Chapter 1197: Traveling around Sparta.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Moving forward, there are fewer and fewer thatched mud houses and more and more traditional Greek courtyards. However, their outer walls have no gorgeous decorations and appear to be very simple. Each one depends on the terrain and streams. , well-proportioned, without feeling crowded at all.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Moreover, various trees, wildflowers, and grasses should be deliberately planted in front of most houses. In this spring season, birds are chirping, streams are gurgling, grass is green, flowers are in full bloom, bees and butterflies are flying, and the air is filled with The intoxicating aroma of vegetation...these houses are submerged in a patch of colorful vegetation. Perhaps this is the unique aesthetics of the Spartans, full of pastoral vitality.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This is the city of Sparta, it's just like a village!" Tertotis, the eldest son of Leoticides and now a follower of Crotocathax, showed a disappointed look on his face.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Tertotis grew up in Theonia, and for some reason, Leoticides never told his children about Sparta, so he did not have any special feelings for Sparta. , was very repulsive after learning about his life experience, feeling that this life experience would make him look strange among the citizens of Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax agreed to Leoticides' request and let him stay with him. In fact, he did not use him as an orderly. On the contrary, he treated him as well as he treated his own brother.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Because after this period of getting along, Clotokatax felt that Tertotis and Briantes had similar personalities and ages, so when he entered Sparta this time, he specially brought Tertotis with him. He was with me out of good intentions to let him see his hometown. As a result, the young man who was used to the prosperity of Thurii obviously did not like the simple and simple Sparta.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Hey, boy!" Olivers showed a weird smile: "When I have the opportunity, I will take you to the Lagunda Pass from Mount Taygetos to Messenia. I heard that there is an unfathomable canyon there. , the Spartans threw the newborn babies who were not strong enough into the canyon. Over the past hundred years, I don't know how many babies' bones have accumulated in it..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Tertotis glared at him fiercely and shook his head. Go ahead and ignore him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Commander Olivers, saying such disgusting things at this time affects our mood too much." Printols said half-jokingly, half-complainingly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The disgusting things the Spartans did are far more than this. Fortunately, the kind Hades let us come." Olivers sighed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Tertotis listened, and his disgust for Sparta increased in his heart.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "That should be the acropolis of Sparta." At this time, Clotokatax asked loudly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Following the direction of his finger, a not too high hill rose up among the low houses in front. On the hill stood several tall temples with walls made of dark red marble. As he approached Looking up from below, the temple looked majestic and majestic, but there were no walls around it, so Crotokatax was not sure.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "That can be regarded as the Acropolis of Sparta, the Temple of Athena-Chuckorok." Sekerian replied.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The acropolis of a Greek city-state was not only the center of faith and sacrifice for the people of the city-state, but also the last fortress in the face of invasion by foreign enemies. It was generally surrounded by stone walls as a protective barrier.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But since the Spartans can be confident that they don't need a city wall to defend the city, they might as well not build the acropolis wall in the future, but I'm afraid they regret it now... Crotokas thought to himself, he couldn't bear it. The resident raised another question that puzzled him: "Don't the Spartans worship Zeus and Hercules? But why is Athena worshiped in their acropolis?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian shrugged: " There is a relatively small Temple of Heracles on the top of the mountain, but the Acropolis is indeed dominated by Athena. As for why this is so? I can't answer it. Maybe I'll catch an old Spartan man and ask him some other time. ?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Spartans advocate war, and Athena is the goddess of war wisdom. I'm afraid it has something to do with it." Printors mentioned.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Since Spartans like to fight, it may be more appropriate to worship Ares, the god of war." Olivers also interjected.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Actually, the Spartans are very particular about strategy in war and generally do not act recklessly, which is consistent with the domain of war wisdom that Athena is good at. However, the barbaric and ferocious Ares is not popular among the Greek people, and there are few The city-state worships him, and I heard that he is highly respected among the Thracians in northern Greece..." Crotokatax couldn't help but express his speculation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As they talked, a group of people walked around to the front of the Temple of Athena. The place was completely paved with large flat stone slabs and steps, extending up to the temple step by step. It was completely different from the bumpy dirt road before.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Commander, do you want to go to the temple to see it?" Sekerian made an invitation gesture.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax hesitated, then shook his head.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotokatax graduated from Thurii School with honors, and he knew very well that the Acropolis temple of the Greek city-state was different from that of the Kingdom of Theonia in that ordinary people were not allowed to enter the main temple casually. (Only priests who can communicate with gods can enter), so the temple gates are usually guarded by guards. However, now that the Spartan people have become prisoners, it is impossible for anyone to guard their acropolis.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It's just that although he entered here as a winner, he was not prepared to blaspheme the Spartans' beliefs with an arrogant attitude.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotokatax didn't go up, and other generals were too embarrassed to go up.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Temple of Athena is already in the center of the Spartan city. Walking forward on the flat stone road, you will be surrounded by either tall bronze sculptures or magnificent buildings: an open-air sports arena, a theater-like civic venue, a few-year-old A ten-meter colonnade-style open building - a public canteen, altars of various gods and heroes, and a victory column with statues of famous Spartan kings as top decorations, which are mainly used for citizens' daily life. A square for training and gathering during war...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Here, the city of Sparta finally showed a Greek hegemony that was far beyond what a village could match.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Presumably there used to be many Spartan people wandering in this area every day, and there were also many Spartan citizens, old and young, naked and exercising and fighting here. It must have been very lively... But now except for a team The Theonian soldiers patrolling in the team could no longer see anyone else and looked very lonely.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax couldn't help but ask: "General Sekerian, where did you imprison the Spartan people?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Some of them were imprisoned in the Spartan warrior training ground in the southeast, mainly women and Young children; and some are at the port, helping us load and unload supplies. Both places are heavily guarded, and it is impossible for them to escape."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax nodded, and then he saw a bronze statue about 10 meters high standing not far ahead. The statue was a fully armed Spartan warrior, with his head held high and his eyes firm. , holding a shield in his left hand, and punching the ground with a spear in his right hand, giving people a firm and unyielding demeanor.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Various wild flowers are planted around the statue. They are blooming at this season, giving the cold statue a little more life.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This is the cemetery of King Leonidas of Sparta." Sekerian pointed at the statue, and his relaxed expression calmed down.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The one who died at Thermopylae?!" Tagtinos asked excitedly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, that's the hero." Sekerian responded in a deep voice.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Everyone's expressions suddenly became solemn.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Spartan king Leonidas led 300 soldiers to garrison at Thermopylae to resist the hundreds of thousands of Persian troops. The story of them being unable to advance for a time, but eventually all of them died in battle due to betrayal by traitors has long been a household legend in Greece. Hundreds of years have passed. Still durable.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Spartans erected a special statue for people to worship this king who won great reputation for the city-state. I am afraid they also hoped that his brave and fearless spirit of sacrifice could be passed down among the citizens.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Crotocathax and the others were enemies, they paid their respects to the Spartan hero from the bottom of their hearts.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a moment, everyone turned and left, and Sekerian suddenly sighed proudly: "Unfortunately... the era of Sparta is about to pass! Maybe the story of our Theonian hero will be spread among the Greek people in the future! "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Many of these stories must be about you, Sekerian," Olivers quipped.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I think this day is not far away!" Clotokatax immediately took over and encouraged everyone.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Under the guidance of Sekerian, everyone strode towards a majestic building not far away that was also made of red marble and looked heavy and solemn. This was the Assembly Hall, the highest center of power in Sparta.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It was the seat of the Council of Elders and the five censors, but now it will become the place where Clotocathus and the generals discussed how to deal with Sparta.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hundreds of years ago, a group of Dorians who came south from northern Greece occupied the Eurotas River plain and established many villages. They were called The Lacedaemonians called this land Laconia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As time went by, one of the villages arose and won the right to rule over four nearby villages, thus uniting to establish a town, known as "Sparta", and having its own king.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Soon after, they began to wage war against other Lacedaemonian villages, but during the same period, several towns also sprang up elsewhere in Lagoria, and Sparta was not strong enough to complete the war against the entire region. Its conquest caused other villages to unite to fight against it.&#13;
