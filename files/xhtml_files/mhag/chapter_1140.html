   Chapter 1140 Declaration of War on Sparta (3)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Then notify the chief administrators of these two towns and arrange as soon as possible for these prestigious citizens of the kingdom who were born in Messenia to come to Thurii and come to the palace together. Discuss how to rebuild Messenia. Lord Lysias, you are responsible for arranging this matter."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Lysias opposed Theonia's involvement in the Greek war, he did not respond to the order given by Davos. Not daring to disobey, he replied with some reluctance: "Yes."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked at him, and then turned his gaze to another person who had remained silent so far: "Proseus, you, the king of the kingdom, The ever-victorious general is from Argos, so he should be familiar with Sparta. What suggestions do you have for the next military action the kingdom will take?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides was a little surprised, and then his expression became indifferent. , said: "Your Majesty, I have no objection."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In Davos's impression, although Proseus was taciturn, when he talked about military affairs, he would talk a lot and be quite insightful. Today is a bit unusual.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked at him again and said: "After the meeting is over, you have to discuss it carefully with the Ministry of Military Affairs, because this time we send troops to Greece, you will be the commander of the army."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alexis and other generals listened I was not surprised when I received this appointment: since His Majesty Davos designated the First Legion as the army to go to Greece, then Plesius, as the commander of the First Legion, must be the best candidate for commander. Today, Among the Theonian army, the only one who can surpass Proseus in terms of record, qualifications, and multi-legion commanding ability is Alexis, but as the Minister of Military Affairs, it is generally impossible for him to attend the battle in person.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As for Amyntas, not to mention that he has now retired, and the people of Thurii have complained a lot about him in recent years because the First Army he led suffered too many casualties in the Western Mediterranean War.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As for the rising stars in the army, such as Patroclus, Sextus and others, they each have important responsibilities, and there is the first legion on the expedition, so it is impossible for them to serve as commanders.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The ministers present all felt that this appointment was a matter of course, but Leoticides hesitated for a moment before answering: "...Yes." Davos&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   glanced at him again, then stood up, and slowly glanced at him with his deep eyes. He passed everyone's face and said with a serious expression: "Everyone, since we have made it clear that we are going to Greece, no matter whether you have any objections in your heart, or how the war situation in Greece will develop next, you must concentrate your efforts, unite and cooperate, and carefully Prepare for the next expedition of great significance!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, Your Majesty!!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the ministers dispersed, Davos called for information Minister Aristiras (after Davos took advantage of the great dispute to reform the Senate and completely separate administrative decision-making power from the Senate), it didn't take long for him to establish the Kingdom's Intelligence Department, allowing him to quietly serve as The intelligence organization of Aristiras he served was completely and openly transferred to the public. Its highest position, intelligence chief, was at the highest level of mid-level officials and did not reach the senior level. This can be regarded as a small sign of Davos's respect for other ministers. compromise).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Did something happen to Proseus recently?" Davos asked seemingly casually.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aristelas thought for a while and replied: "Lord Prosaus is as before, his life is regular and monotonous, there is nothing abnormal... His family is also very peaceful." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Well..." Davos gently used his fingers. Knocking on the table, recalling the scene of the meeting just now, Proseus was obviously a little absent-minded. This was the first time he had seen this kind of situation from this victorious general: "Send a few more people, and in the next period of time Please observe me more carefully inside, it is best to understand his eating conditions, sleeping conditions, etc..." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Yes, Your Majesty, I will make arrangements right away." Aristelas responded immediately.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "We're about to go to Greece soon, so we can't make any mistakes..." Davos muttered thoughtfully, then looked up at Aristelas: "Has the situation of the Border Legion paid off recently?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Yes. "Aristiras was well prepared and immediately took out two papyrus rolls from his arms, one of which was obviously much thicker.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos took the thick papyrus roll first, and did not open it immediately, but asked: "This one comes from the Po River area (after the conquest of Gaul in the mountains, the Kingdom of Theonia was established here) the middle reaches of the Po River)?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos opened it with great interest and took a closer look. Sure enough, it was still the same style. It not only recorded the daily words and deeds of the army commander Hasdrubal and the main officers of the Border Army, as well as the mobilization and sorties of the army, but also recorded more details. It records in detail the consumption and changes in the food baggage, and even describes in detail the customs and customs of the Liguria region that the regiment passed through... In addition, it also includes some of the recorder's views on the defense and counterattack of the Ligurian tribes. And some suggestions on how to better deal with the Ligurians and further assimilate them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   From the perspective of monitoring and providing intelligence, this recorder is obviously unqualified, but the intelligence he submitted is very important to Davos. It is of great reference value, so Davos stopped Aristiras from the beginning who wanted to force him to change his ways.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I remember that the provider of this information was called Maximus, a Roman, and he used to serve as Former mayor of Rome..." Davos carefully rolled up the papyrus: "He became an official citizen of Theonia last year, right?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What is your current position in the Po Frontier Corps?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, it was with your special approval last year that he became a formal citizen. Now he is a baggage officer of the Border Legion and has won Hasdrubal's trust.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The baggage officer... his position in the legion is already not low. "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Davos lowered his head and looked at the papyrus scroll, and said thoughtfully: "Such a person is just an ordinary member of the intelligence department, and he is a bit underserved!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I think that after the Ligurian rebellion is calmed down, I will find someone to replace him. I have other important uses for him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Your Majesty. "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aristelas hurriedly bowed and said: "The Intelligence Department is newly built, and it is in urgent need of people like Maximus who have profound knowledge and can coordinate the organization!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   If that's the case..." Davos pondered for a while and said, "Then transfer him back as soon as possible to help you reorganize, plan and manage the Intelligence Department. After all, the Intelligence Department is now a regular part of the kingdom." The administrative department must have a formal appearance. I don't want the Supervision Department to accuse you every day!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ...I understand, Your Majesty. "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Aristiras bowed again and broke out in a cold sweat.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Aristelas went out, Henipolis walked into the meeting hall and saw Davos with his hands behind his back, staring intently at the map of the Mediterranean on the wall.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He said softly: "Your Majesty, I'm here."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos did not look back and said slowly: "Heni, how many years has it been since Croto left Thurii?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Henipolis' heart moved and he immediately said: "I remember that in the fourteenth year of the Kingdom, Your Majesty led the army north to attack Rome. His Highness Croto also followed. Since then, he has stayed in Rome. It has been thirteen years now and he has left Rome. It's been a long time!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, it's been a long time!" Davos sighed, turned around, and said meaningfully: "Although he has done a pretty good job in Rome, and has already served as the administrator of Rome. It's been three years, but I've been away from Thurii for too long, and it's easy to be forgotten!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hernepolis' eyelids twitched slightly, and he couldn't help but think of what Ansitanos had said here before, and he immediately stood solemnly, silent.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Pick up the pen." Davos said.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes." Henipolis immediately sat down at the wooden table and quickly picked up a pen and paper.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Give instructions to the auxiliary ministers, saying that Crotocatacus has been away from Turii for many years. Princess Christoya misses him so much that she is allowed to step down from his post in advance and return to Turii to serve his mother. Rome The successor of the chief executive will be decided by their discussion..." As soon as Davos finished dictating, Henipolis had already written it and was about to hand the order to Davos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But Davos said: "Give them another order, saying that Ansitanos wants to step down as foreign minister. I have approved it. The successor is Tapirus. I hope they can complete the handover as soon as possible to avoid affecting the succession." Come down to carry out military operations against Sparta."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hernepolis' hand holding the pen trembled slightly, and after a moment he responded softly: "...Your Majesty, it's written."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166; ...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It was already dusk when Leoticides came out of the Military Ministry and set out on his way home.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Initially, Leoticides' home was in the port area of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;Thurii; later he became a legionnaire and became a citizen of Theonia. Most of the land he received for his military exploits was mostly concentrated in Cres. Rimisa, so he also built a house there, but he rarely lived there, because at that time he was already the commander of the Eighth Legion and stayed in the Catania military camp all year round; later, he entered the Senate , coupled with his brilliant achievements, the kingdom assigned him a residential land in the eastern outer city of Thurii, not far from the Temple of Hera, and their family has lived there since then.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Most of the senators who live in the inner city walk home because they are very close to the Grand Assembly Hall and Victory Square; most of the senators who live in the outer city go home in a sedan chair because of the longer distance and to avoid being disturbed by pedestrians on the road. At home, only a few people choose to ride horses, and the horses are reported and approved by the city guards. Leoticides is one of them, and he also has 4 horse-riding followers surrounding him to protect him. safety.&#13;
