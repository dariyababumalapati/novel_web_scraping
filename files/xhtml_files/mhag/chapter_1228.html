   Chapter 1228 Athens Surrender (1)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Callistratus brought back Theonia's prerequisites for agreeing to peace, and read them out at the citizens' meeting held on Mount Prix, which immediately aroused the anger of the citizens. According to the I Socrates said, "The vicious Theonia wants to destroy Athens!".&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So the citizens were eager to fight and unanimously agreed: to fight to the death with the Theonians who were preparing to destroy Athens.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Athenians were ready for a comprehensive defense, and after the two Theonian armies joined forces, the self-aware Crotokatax took the initiative to give up unified military command to Patroclus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Patroclus did not refuse, but he also did not launch an attack on the city of Athens immediately. Instead, he ordered the 100,000 troops to build a strong camp around the city of Athens (the 100,000 troops included not only Clotokataxus and Pax The Theonian army led by Troclus, as well as allied armies such as Thebes, Mandinia, Argos, Corinth, and Megara).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, he also divided his troops to sweep across the entire Attica region. After capturing the villages and towns, he drove all the people in the villages and towns who failed to escape into the city of Athens in time to the city of Athens, and then the army immediately stayed away.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   These people were wailing outside the city. Seeing that there was no danger, the soldiers inside the city immediately opened the city gate and let them in.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Callistratus, Iphicrates and others could not stop them at all, because these people were all Athenians and relatives or relatives of the citizens in the city, so within a few days the city of Athens accommodated the entire Atti The population of the Ka area has reached nearly 300,000.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Athens is the largest city in mainland Greece, and with the port of Piraeus, the entire city area exceeds 20 square kilometers, such a huge population still puts great pressure on the entire city to survive: many people fled into The residents of Attica in the city have no place to live, so they sleep directly in the courtyards and squares of public buildings. Even temporary shacks built by people can be seen on both sides of the road from Piraeus to the Acropolis. Naturally, there is no guarantee of safety in the city. The house is clean and tidy, but there is excrement everywhere, and few people clean it up. Moreover, it is still the end of September, the temperature is still high, flies and mosquitoes are flying everywhere, and the stench is overwhelming.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   For the generals, this is still a small problem. The main headache for them is food.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although a lot of food was stored in the city in advance in order to organize the coalition forces to fight against Theonia, it still felt tight in the face of such huge population pressure.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Callistratus and others had to spend a lot of words to convince the 500-person parliament, and then organized manpower to strictly control food consumption.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition, drinking water is also an issue.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There were originally several rivers in the Athens area, but they were all outside the city and under the control of the Theonian army. Therefore, the people in the city could only rely on the wells in the city. Residents in the city and refugees outside the city often competed for the wells. There were disputes and even conflicts over usage rights, and the Athenian government had to send additional manpower to maintain the order of water intake from each well.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During this period, several Athenian doctors who had participated in several Greek medical forums organized by the Theonian Academy of Medicine jointly warned the Athens government: They must try their best to ensure the cleanliness of the city, otherwise the too dirty environment will caused the plague.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Their suggestions attracted the attention of the General Executive Committee. You must know that after the Peloponnesian War began, the Spartan coalition attacked Athens from overland. At that time, Athens also defended itself from the city. The situation was not much different from today, but it did not Not long after, a great plague broke out in the city, and Pericles also fell ill and died.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although these doctors claimed that "the knowledge they learned was learned from the Theonian Medical College", the Athenian generals did not ignore it. After all, the high medical level of Dionysius has gradually been achieved over the years. Some city-states in the Eastern Mediterranean agreed, and the nightmare caused by the plague to the Athenians was too terrible, so even though they were enemies, Callistratus and others still decided to adopt their suggestions and sent a large number of people to clean the streets every day. Try your best to keep the city clean.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before the formal war began, the top officials of Athens, headed by Callistratus, were already exhausted mentally and physically due to the surge in administrative matters in the city, and the people were also struggling to spend every day in tension, panic, and busyness.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, the Theonian army still did not launch an attack. Only the ballistae teams of each legion, under the order of Patroclus, were evenly distributed around the city of Athens and began to fire a large number of small stone bullets into the city of Athens. These stone bullets They continued to cross the city wall and smashed nearby houses, causing panic among the Athenian people and forcing them to stay away from the city wall, which also caused crowding in the center of the city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In order to ensure that soldiers could go up and down the city wall without hindrance, Athenian officials had to arrange for slaves to clean up the ruins caused by stone bombardment near the city wall. Soon, people kept reporting to the city hall, saying that "the slaves at home have repeatedly Go out quietly and meet in secret with other slaves. Their whereabouts are mysterious."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The city hall immediately sent out patrols and arrested some slaves for interrogation. The results were shocking. It turned out that the slaves who were responsible for cleaning up the ruins near the city wall discovered stone bullets shot into the city. Almost all are engraved with Greek text, and the main meaning is "As long as the slaves dare to rise up against their masters and the city-state, and assist the Theonian army to break the city, Theonia will not only grant them freedom, but even give them land... "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Athens had prosperous culture and developed commerce. Many slaves were not only literate, but were also trained by their masters to become their assistants in business. In their interactions with foreign merchants, they knew something about the treatment of slaves in the Kingdom of Theonia in the west. "more tolerant" thing, so some slaves were tempted and began to contact and discuss privately. As a result, the news quickly spread among the slaves in Athens... When the&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   general executive committee found out, they were all scared into a cold sweat, because The slave population in the city of Athens is over 100,000, which is almost the same as the number of people in Athens. However, the living conditions of the slaves in Athens are not all better than that of the helots in Sparta. For example, the number of mining slaves in the Laurion silver mine is not only extremely large, but also Life is extremely poor, and many slaves die in the mines every year... Of course, these slaves are full of resentment towards the slave masters who exploited them, and there have been many incidents of group rebellion against their masters.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The most famous one was during the Peloponnesian War, when more than 40,000 Athenian slaves united and escaped from the city of Athens, causing a major blow to Athens' national power.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the previous military meeting, Iphicrates also made a suggestion: organize young and strong male slaves and distribute them with weapons to help defend the city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although this suggestion was not approved immediately, it did move some people, so it has been under discussion. But now that something like this has happened, naturally it will not be considered again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And under their orders, the city patrol immediately took action and arrested hundreds of slaves who had been cleaning the ruins.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, the 500-person assembly passed a resolution requiring the people in the city to keep an eye on their own slaves, prohibit them from going out, and report any abnormalities to the city hall immediately.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The city hall also organized a group of soldiers to take care of the city-state slaves.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just when the General Executive Committee was extremely busy, another piece of bad news came: the main city built on the heights of Aegina Island finally fell after tenaciously defending against several storming attacks by the Theonian army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since then, the warships of Theonia's First Fleet and Third Fleet have been stationed at the Port of Aegina, the Port of Ismia in Corinth, and the Port of Megara, so that Piraeus in Athens can be transported 24 hours a day. The port blockade is airtight.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On land, Patroclus issued an order: Let the soldiers who had built the camp start building a siege platform a hundred meters away from the city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, an order was issued: Let each legion engineering battalion build super siege towers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the order was issued, one hundred thousand soldiers immediately began to be busy. The surrounding area outside the city of Athens turned into construction sites, and dust was flying every day.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The transport fleet in Theonia was also busy. They transported the trees cut down by Messenians and Laconia from Mount Taygetos to Megara, and then transported them to Theonia by pack teams. Sub-camp, and then engineers led craftsmen to manufacture siege equipment (in the entire Peloponnese and Central Greece, only Sparta, which did not pay attention to navigation, still had dense forests, and the trees on Mount Taygetos They are all extremely strong and tall).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Standing on the top of the 10-meter-high Athens city, the Athenian citizen soldiers became more and more nervous day by day, because they saw mounds rising up on the originally flat land outside the city, and they were getting taller day by day, almost surpassing the Athens city wall. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Iphicrates did not have a passive defense. He led Thracian light shields and Jason's mercenaries out of the city several times to conduct raids. At first, he achieved some results, killing some enemy soldiers, and even once The camp of the Megara army was breached in the night attack, but due to fear of alerting the enemy, not many soldiers participated in the night attack, and the Theonian army was reinforced in time and failed to expand the results.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But after that, the Theonian coalition learned its lesson. Under the strict requirements of Patroclus, the various military camps not only strengthened their defenses, but also strengthened their connections with each other, and the Theonian soldiers also The trenches in front of each siege platform (formed by digging the earth to build the siege platform) were connected and expanded into trenches, making it difficult for the Athenian army to even raid the construction site.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, after several raids in which he lost his troops and generals, Iphicrates had to temporarily stop this risky approach.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, the construction speed of the Theonian soldiers was greatly accelerated, and finally siege platforms more than 10 meters high towered outside the city of Athens. The Athenian soldiers looked up at these mounds that were higher than the city wall, and they all felt panic.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But what frightened them even more was that stone bullets roared from these mounds, crossed the city walls, and landed in the city of Athens.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;

   Thanks for the reward, Fatty Zaemon!&#13;
