   Chapter 1160 Leotychides' Suggestion&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Olivers's face changed, and he immediately realized that he had almost made a big mistake.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   If he really did this and let His Majesty Davos know about it, he would definitely think that he was the one who took the lead in embarrassing Crotoka Tax, and then he would definitely face His Majesty's wrath...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So, he quickly smiled Said: "Haha, drinking is just to scare Ctissus. Let's just eat and chat tonight! You are in luck! The Gulf of Messenia has always been closed before, so the seafood is very delicious, and the oysters are plentiful and fat. It's so big that I can eat you until you die!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Then I have to have a good taste!" Tagtilos quickly answered, and at this moment he also realized that he had just said the wrong thing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Printors felt relieved, and now he couldn't help but look at Trotilasco.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotokatax and his party arrived at the camp, no, it should be said that they came to the city of Messenae (passed by the Deogna soldiers and Messenians). After more than a month of joint efforts by the Nians, this former Spartan camp could barely be regarded as a city), entered the military tent, and conducted military affairs handover with Leoticides.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This is my first time as an army commander, and I don't have much confidence in whether I can complete the important tasks assigned by my father." Clotokatax said frankly: "General Proseus, you are a battle-hardened warrior of the kingdom. He is a famous general and has a deep understanding of the Peloponnesus. Can you give me some advice?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the handover of military affairs was completed, Leoticides was ready to pack his bags immediately and leave here early. Unexpectedly, Cloro Tokatax would make such a request. He looked at the sincere prince in front of him and looked around: in addition to them, there were also Printors and Muklu in the tent, and they were talking in a low voice. What (Although Leotychides has been transferred, staff officer Taglu will still stay as a subordinate of Printors, handling trivial military affairs)...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leotychides hesitated for a moment, He said coldly: "I am the prince of Sparta. Do you believe my suggestion...?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "My father firmly believed that you, general, would not betray the kingdom, so when he received your first letter, he refused military service. The Ministry's proposal still allowed you to continue as commander. It was not until he received your second letter that you asked to resign from this position that he hesitated for a long time before choosing to agree. He told me, 'The reason why people are human is Just because you have rich emotions, you can't fight against your hometown people, which is completely reasonable.'...And, he also sighed and said to me, 'Unexpectedly, Proseus looks like a wooden man, but in his heart he is Such kindness and justice!'... These are the father's exact words. Although I don't know much about you, general, my father believes in you, and I have no reason not to believe you!" Clotokatax said still frankly. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After hearing these words, Leotychides felt a slight disturbance in his heart, but his expression remained indifferent, and then asked: "After defeating the Spartan army, what will your Highness do with Sparta?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotocathacus He solemnly said: "Sparta is the most important city-state in Greece and an important part of the various forces in Greece. If it is completely eliminated, it will not only make other Greek people resentful, but also lead to the collapse of the entire Greece and the entire Sparta." The imbalance of Pennesian power is not what the father wants to see, nor is it in the interests of the kingdom!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, we will treat the defeated Sparta just like we treated Carthage. Sparta will lose its former glory. Brilliant, its political system may also undergo some changes, but it will continue to survive, and even the ordinary people of Sparta may live better than they do now, because as far as I know, the living conditions of the people in Sparta are relatively better today. Oops..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After hearing this, Leoticides said nothing. He slowly walked to the main seat, pulled a wooden chair and sat down. He turned around and said, "Muklu, help me get the ball rolling." Bring me the map of Nyssa."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The wooden map was placed on the table. Leoticides glanced at Crotokatax, and then said in a deep voice: "Now we occupy Messenia, which is about 100 meters away from Spar. It is only separated by Mount Taygetos, but it is not easy to invade its territory. There&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   are two ways! One is to take the army by ship, land on the coast of Sparta, and repeat the method we used to capture Messenia. But The reason why we were able to successfully capture Messenia was because the action was sudden and the Spartans had no time to prepare their defenses. However, Sparta's strength declined significantly after suffering the defeat in the Battle of Leuctra. The obvious lack of military strength allowed our army to successfully land. But landing on the Spartan coast was much more difficult.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   First of all, although the number of Spartan warriors may have been less than 2,000, this only refers to young adults. Citizens, people over 50 years old can still fight in armor, and their combat effectiveness will not be too weak. In this way, Sparta can temporarily form a force of nearly 4,000 people. There are&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   still Pileasians living in the Spartan territory. I will not Before leaving Sparta, I remember that the number of Pilians was three times that of Spartans. It may have dropped significantly now, but it should not be a big problem to form a team of 5,000 people, and according to Spartan tradition , as long as there is a war, the Piliasians must provide sufficient soldiers. Sparta has fought frequently in these years, so the combat effectiveness of the Piliasians should not be weak. There are&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   also a large number of helots living in Sparta .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   , these helots' ancestors were conquered by Sparta earlier, and Sparta's management of them was stricter. Compared with the Messenians, they were more loyal to the Spartans. In my In my memory, the number of Helots was 7-8 times that of Sparta. Now even if Messenia is lost, the number of remaining Helots will be at least three times as large. It shouldn't be too big to temporarily form a team of 10,000 people. Question. Calculating this way, the Spartans can temporarily form a reliable army of about 20,000 people to defend our landing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Secondly, the Spartan coast is much narrower than the Messenian coast, which makes it easier for the Spartans to defend .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Also, I received news from the navy that during this period the Spartans used all their strength to build countless wooden stakes on the coast... Under such circumstances, if we want to force a landing, even if we win in the end, we will have to pay a huge price. price.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There is one thing... I'm afraid you don't know. Some time ago, the First Fleet occupied the island of Kythera (an island in the Gulf of Laconia). Sekerian persuaded me to lead the army to land on the coast of Sparta, but I refused. He couldn't help but send out fleet infantry alone to harass the coast of Sparta, but he suffered a failure. I heard that hundreds of people died..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax looked at Pulin in surprise. Thors-&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Prince suddenly looked solemn: "The Ministry of Military Affairs has not received any battle reports in this regard.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leotichides said calmly: "Maybe the battle report is still on the way... He is on Kythera Island now. You can also ask him directly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Klotokatax felt a little headache: he thought that getting the generals of the expeditionary army to obey would be his biggest problem as a commander, but he actually forgot about the navy. Sekerian-this The father of the navy and the hero of the kingdom with great military exploits is the most difficult to deal with!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides didn't care what the two people in front of him were thinking. He pointed at the map with his finger: "The other way is from the north of Messenia, through the southern part of the Arcadia region, thus bypassing Tyger." Toss Mountain, entering the northern part of Sparta's territory... But whether the Arcadians can allow our army to enter their territory is a key issue.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Arcadian city-states were once allies of Sparta, However, changes have occurred recently. They established the Arcadian League and wanted to be independent from the Peloponnesian League. Therefore, they were threatened by Sparta. If it had not been for our arrival, they and Sparta would have been separated. There was a war.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Arcadians once sent envoys to Thebes to ask for help. Thebes suggested that they ask for help from us, and also sent envoys to Messenia to intercede for the Arcadians..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You mean the Thebans sent a messenger?!" Clotokatax asked.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It came three days ago, and the messenger was Ipamironda." Leoticides paused intentionally.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sure enough, Crotokatax asked in surprise: "Is it the Boeotian military governor who led his army to defeat the Spartan army at Leuctra?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "That's him." Leoticides seemed to He said calmly: "But I didn't talk to him in detail. I told him that the new commander was about to arrive, so he was willing to stay and wait." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Arcadians didn't send an envoy?" Printor Si asked, he and Clotocathacus had the same doubts: Since Thebes came to intercede on behalf of the Arcadian Alliance, why have the Theban envoys arrived but the Arcadians have not come yet?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I heard from the Theban envoy that the Arcadian envoy who originally followed him was suddenly called back before they could enter Messenia because Sparta sent an envoy to sue for peace with the Arcadians... ..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax was stunned, then understood, and couldn't help asking: "Sparta wants to have a truce with the Arcadians, and then concentrate all its efforts on us. But the Arcadians, who were oppressed by Sparta, Will the Asians agree?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Highness." Leoticides sat firmly on the wooden chair, pointed at his feet, and said in a deep voice: "In this land of Peloponnese, you must firmly Remember one sentence, 'Never trust any agreement of any city-state!' Most of the city-states here are still allies today, enemies tomorrow, and peace is restored the day after tomorrow, for the sake of better survival and interests. This is a common thing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Arcadians have been Sparta's allies for decades. However, they have been frequently dragged into wars by the Spartans in recent years. They were dissatisfied with the Spartans' tyranny and wanted to invade from the Peloponnese. become independent from the alliance. If Sparta takes the initiative to recognize the alliance they established and stops the war against them, it is likely that the relationship between the two parties will return to friendship and even join forces to deal with us..."
