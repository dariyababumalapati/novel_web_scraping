   Chapter 1236 The More Prosperous Port of Thurii&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But the helmsman and lookout of each cargo ship have always maintained a high degree of concentration, and can even be said to be a little nervous, because since the establishment of the New Greek Alliance, this road leading from Saron Bay to The route in Turiyi is much busier and more lively than before. When the speed is so fast, special care must be taken to prevent collisions. Similar accidents occur every year on this route.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just as Hesklaus and the others were enjoying the sea breeze and admiring the sea view, a sound of "Ga! Ga! Ga!" suddenly sounded on the ship.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Does this sound like a duck quacking?" Someone looked around in confusion.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Heskraus suddenly understood and shouted: "Lilias, did you bring your duck to the boat?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a while, Lillias got out of the cabin, holding his hands tightly Holding a white duck in his arms, he timidly said: "Dad, I want Quack to accompany me to Turiyi..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Heskraus roared angrily: "Why didn't you tell me in advance -"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay, okay." The friend next to him advised: "Isn't it just a duck? If the child likes it, let him take it with him. Maybe when we finish all the food, this duck can help us get to the sea. Catch fish to eat."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Hahaha..." In the laughter, Lillias escaped a beating and scolding, and the little white duck became a distraction for the crew during the voyage.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even when night falls, the fleet is still sailing because they carry enough water and are not in a hurry to go ashore to replenish it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And since Theonia took control of the Greek mainland, many measures have been taken to strengthen trade between the Greek mainland and Theonia in the past few years, the most important of which is to ensure the convenience of sea routes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   For example: the entire route is subdivided into more than a dozen areas, and supply points are set up at regular intervals along the coast of each area. Each area must have warships patrolling day and night to fight against pirates or search and rescue distressed crew members. Coastal towns or city-states must expand and improve their ports, especially lighthouses...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, even if you sail at night, the safety will be greatly improved, and even a novice sailor will not be too nervous, because They would encounter greetings from patrol boats from time to time, and see lighthouses on the distant coast from time to time, and then based on the Theonia-Greece navigation chart they held in their hands (the Theonia Commerce Department hired under the instruction of Davos Some sailors traveling between the eastern and western Mediterranean also asked the Ministry of Military Affairs to send cartography experts. After countless explorations and corrections, they finally drew relatively detailed nautical charts, which were then sold to the outside world. They were very popular among merchants and sailors, and demand exceeded supply). They can roughly judge their location and whether there are any reefs around them. Even if the ship is suddenly damaged or there is insufficient water, they can follow the instructions of the lighthouse and map and try their best to reach the nearest supply point or port to the fleet...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So Hesklaus and his fleet sailed day and night, circumnavigating the entire Peloponnese Peninsula without stopping to rest, and it only took them two days to reach Corfu.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the Greek War, Theonia withdrew from its occupation of some islands, such as Zakynsu, Kefalonia, Kythera, Aegina, etc., but only one island did not give up, and that was Kercyra, The people of this small island, which was repeatedly fought over by Athens and Sparta during the Theban War, were already extremely fearful of war. Under the temptation of thoughtful people, they offered to join Theonia, and of course Davos couldn't ask for it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Today's Corfu Island not only has multiple well-equipped ports, but also a military port belonging to the First Fleet, where hundreds of warships are parked for a long time and 2,000 fleet infantry are stationed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Corfu has become the first bridge for the Kingdom of Theonia to control the mainland of Greece, but for Greek merchants, it is the last resting place leading to the mainland of Theonia, and the people living on the island of Corfu have also Benefited a lot.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The crew took a short rest on the island of Corfu, then continued to sail westward, sailed through the Adriatic Sea and entered the Gulf of Turii (someone proposed in the Senate a few years ago: "How can this bay in southern Italy be regarded as a subordinate of the kingdom?" Naming it after a municipality often makes foreigners who come to the kingdom for the first time feel strange. This bay must be named after Thurii, the capital of the kingdom, in order to show its importance and the majesty of the kingdom..." The proposal was quickly received Through this, the Gulf of Taranto was renamed).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the early morning of the fourth day after setting off from the port of Piraeus, Hesklaus's fleet had arrived at the offshore coast of Thurii.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Lyrias had lived in Athens for several years and had always thought that the bustling Port of Piraeus was the largest port in the world. But when he looked at the coast of Thurii from the boat, he was shocked because he could not see it at all. Without reaching the coast, all that can be seen from south to north are ships. Those densely packed masts turn the coast of Thurii into a lush forest.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It turns out that after Theonia conquered Greece, although Greece had a small area and a small population, most of these large and small city-states relied on sea trade for their livelihoods. Therefore, the maritime trade of the Holy Kingdom of Theonia suddenly changed. Several times.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Especially in the capital of Turii, the capacity of the port was a bit tight originally, and now it is even more insufficient. After obtaining the consent of King Davos, the Ministry of Commerce established a new port in the entire Turii region from Amendolara to Castel. On the long coast, as long as a port can be built, we will seize every opportunity to build a new port.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then the Ministry of Commerce named all the ports in the Turiyi region with numbers, and classified all imported and exported goods. Each major category of goods corresponds to a numbered port. This greatly improves management efficiency and avoids confusion. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, the Construction Supervision Department also seized the time to summon a large number of laborers and craftsmen to build two more stone bridges on the Krati River to ensure smooth north-south traffic.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the goods sold by Heskraus and several other Thessalian merchants were different, everyone waved goodbye here and each took a merchant ship loaded with his own goods to the corresponding port.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Port No. 5 for loading and unloading pottery is not far to the north of the mouth of the Craty River. The reason for this arrangement is because the Ministry of Commerce considered that pottery is an indispensable commodity in people's lives, with great demand, and pottery is also easy to break, so it arranged a port for it. It is close to the city and easy to transport.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The cargo ship enters the port, docks at the dock, and hands over the goods to the dock workers to unload the goods and transport them to the warehouse. The labor foreman accompanied Herstrauss to the office in the warehouse... This process is very similar to the Piraeus Port, but What happens next is different.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Citizen or foreigner of Theonia?" the clerk asked.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Citizen of Theonia, from Peleus in Thessaly." Heskraus answered while showing the clerk the iron plate of Theonia citizen he carried.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The clerk checked it carefully and then asked: "Have you registered with the Ministry of Commerce and have the right to do business?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, this is my merchant ID." Hesklaus skillfully took out another iron plate he carried with him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The clerk checked it carefully again, and then asked: "Is this your first time doing business in Turiyi?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   No, I have been here many times, and there is my shop in the pottery market." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In that case , I will not tell you what you should pay attention to when doing business in Turiyi." The clerk said seriously: "But if you are found to be telling lies in the future, as a citizen of Theonia, you will not only He will be severely punished and may also be deprived of his citizenship. Do you understand?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Understood!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Please confirm whether what is written on the cargo bill is correct?" The clerk handed him a paper book and opened it. The type and quantity of goods carried by Heskraus was clearly written on the piece of paper, and there was the signature of the clerk at the end. (After receiving inspiration from Davos, the craftsmen went through countless experiments and finally created paper that could be written on. , produced and sold in large quantities by the Christoya Chamber of Commerce. From then on, the Holy Kingdom of Theonia no longer suffered from the shortage of papyrus).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After confirming that it was correct, Heskraus also signed his name, turned over the second piece of paper, and signed his name on the back of the same content.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The clerk stamped the seal, then tore off one of the sheets and handed it to Hesklaus. The entire port entry inspection was over. It would not be like the Piraeus Port where the total value of the imported goods had to be repeatedly calculated before letting him know. Merchants pay a 10% tax and then measure the quality of the silver coins... which is very cumbersome.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The dock workers transported the goods to the seaport for export. After Heskraus handed the cargo bill to the checkpoint for inspection, he could leave the port.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since there was a pottery market not far from the port, he did not let the dock workers continue to transport the goods and paid them on the spot.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then someone was sent to notify the store employees to move the pottery.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Athens Pottery Shop, this is the name of Hesklaus's pottery shop. It is simple and direct, but customers can understand it at a glance.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since he was the first pottery merchant from Athens to set up shop in Thurii (before the Greek wars, due to the trade boycott of Theonia by Athens and its maritime alliances, no Athenians did business in Theonia, so Dionysius It is almost impossible for Aonian merchants to buy Athenian pottery directly). Later Athenian merchants established pottery shops in Thurii, and it was no longer possible to take similar store names, because the "Theonian Law" stipulates that the same type of goods is not allowed There are duplicate store names.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It is said that some Athenian businessmen hated Heskraus very much, thinking that the great name "Athens Pottery" had been blasphemed by a Thessalian, but no one dared to blatantly hurt him because he was a citizen of Theonia, and There is protection from Theonia's big shots behind him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hercules walked into the store and saw that most of the shelves were empty. A smile suddenly appeared on his face: "It seems that business has been very good during this period!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
