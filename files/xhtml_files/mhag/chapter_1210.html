   Chapter 1210 Landing in Thessaly (2)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The people of Peleus closed the city gate tightly and were forced to pick up their weapons helplessly. After climbing the city wall, they trembled all over when they saw the Theonian army coming like a tide. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But the Second Legion did not attack the city of Peleus. They bypassed the small city and went straight to the valley pass.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The people of Peleus looked at the retreating enemies in shock. Suddenly someone exclaimed: "Look! Another enemy has come ashore!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thousands of black soldiers were seen surging on the beach not far away. After they landed on the beach and adjusted themselves for a while, they quickly ran towards Peleus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just when the people of Peleus felt that they must be doomed this time, this Theonian army once again bypassed the city of Peleus and entered the valley pass...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After all, the heavily armed Matonis was old, and followed the soldiers After running for a while, his physical strength could no longer keep up. Even if he had to stop to catch his breath, he never forgot to ask his adjutant to urge the soldiers forward on his behalf.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After all, among the landing sites selected by the Ministry of Military Affairs, Peleus has the best geographical conditions and location. The only worry is that after the Thessalians get the news, they send troops to block the valley pass, so the Second Army We must race against time to open this passage to the hinterland of Thessaly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the soldiers of the Second Legion had been recuperating on the ship, after disembarking they wore armor, held weapons in hand, and ran non-stop for a long time. Everyone would feel tired, but they kept gritting their teeth and persevered. This was because in their hearts There is a belief that supports them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before this operation, Matonis mobilized all legionnaires for combat. He once said impassionedly: "This landing operation is an unprecedented major military operation and will definitely be recorded in the history of the Kingdom of Theonia. It will be remembered by future generations. It is precisely because the Ministry of Military Affairs believes that our Second Army is the best among the participating armies, so our Second Army is asked to shoulder the most important raid mission in this landing operation!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Can the landing operation be successful? , mainly depends on whether we can occupy the pass in time. Haven't we been competing with the First Army! 'They marched more than ten miles in Volscian and defeated the Roman army'. They have always been concerned about it. We are boasting, but tomorrow we will tell them with victory that marching more than 10 miles in a hurry is nothing. The strongest legion in the kingdom will only be our Second Legion!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This unyielding belief supports the soldiers of the Second Legion. The pace kept moving, and in the past two years, in order to better communicate with the city-state of Thessaly to the south of the mountain range, the Peleus built a flat road in the valley pass, which also provided assistance for the second legion's rapid march.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Finally, the light armored brigade of the Second Legion running at the front saw the exit of the river valley and the defensive camp that lay across the exit.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It's just that in the eyes of the soldiers, this camp is too simple: there is no trench in front of the camp, and there may be no traps. The camp wall is a wooden fence with a height of no more than three meters. There are only two watchtowers in the camp... The most important thing is that the wooden There were only a few defenders on the wall, who shouted in panic after seeing their arrival.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In order to show his sincerity to the Peleus, Jason asked the Larissa to dismantle the checkpoint at the entrance of the valley. Some time ago, Jason was reminded by Iphicrates, so he sent a messenger back to Thessaly to ask for The city-states strengthened their vigilance to prevent the Theonian army from landing and raiding. Although the Larissa people did not believe that the Theonian army would land from the remote and narrow Peleus coast, they still stayed in the river valley out of a preparedness mentality. A defensive camp was urgently built at the entrance, but due to the rush of time, they built it carelessly, just to gain a sense of peace of mind.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, the only mercenary army in Thessaly today is commanded by Polydorus and is stationed outside the city of Philae, mainly to ensure the safety of the coast of Philae and Almiros.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It was unrealistic for Larissa to send citizen soldiers to station in the valley camp for a long time, so the method they adopted was to send a small number of citizens to station in the camp, rotating every few days. Once they learned that the Theonian army had landed on the coast of Peleus, Then send a large force to the camp for defense.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Who would have thought that not long after Peleus' urgent messenger arrived at the camp, the Theonian army appeared in front of him like a divine soldier descending from the sky. This speed was too fast. The messenger who ran to report the news may not have arrived yet. Sa city!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Did the Peleus deliberately delay the announcement?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ...The panicked defenders couldn't help but have such suspicions, but the severe situation outside the camp no longer allowed them to think too much.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Theonian light armored brigade had just stood outside the camp, and the light infantry brigade responsible for carrying the siege ladder arrived later. After they handed the wooden ladder to the light armored brigade, they began to disperse the formation and approach the camp. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The sparse arrows fired by the defenders did not cause any damage to the Theonian soldiers. On the contrary, they were replaced by a rain of arrows that covered the sky. Amidst the screams of the defenders, the light armored soldiers moved one by one. Wooden ladders were put up on the wooden wall, and the valley camp was quickly captured.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The news of this victory was quickly spread from one end of the river valley to the other with cheers. Matonis was relieved after knowing it and called the messenger: "You immediately inform the commander of the Lizaru Army and say, 'Valley Pass' It has been opened, and he can lead the army to land on the coast of Peleus!'"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Two fleets landed in northern Thessaly: the second and fifth legions led by Martonis, The second cavalry legion will land on the coast of Peleus; the other legion, led by Lizaru and under the jurisdiction of the third and ninth legions, will land on the coast south of the Macedonian town of Dion further north. They will head south Cross the mountains and enter Thessaly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the army led by Lizaru would have to go further and more difficult, and would even encounter some indigenous tribes living in the mountains, Patroclus stayed in Sparta for a few days, and through careful questioning of those who had been in Macedonia After learning more information, the Spartans who had fought in the country decided to modify the landing plan formulated by the Ministry of Military Affairs and let the fleet led by Lizaru temporarily stay near the coast of Peleus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Once it is determined that Martonis's troops have successfully raided, Lizaru can also lead his troops into Thessaly through the valley pass without having to take a long detour. However, if Martonis fails, both armies can continue to go north, in They landed in Macedonian territory and took care of each other when crossing the mountains.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So when Lizaru learned that "the Second Legion had passed through the mountain pass and entered the hinterland of Thessaly", he was overjoyed and immediately ordered the fleet to approach the coast of Peleus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Wave after wave of Theonian troops landed, and then quickly rushed into the valley pass... The people of Peleus in the city looked at this repeated scene, and the initial panic gradually became a little numb, until finally After the three brigades of the Ninth Legion landed on the coast, they did not hurriedly bypass the city of Peleus. Instead, under the leadership of the captain, they carried the siege ladder and went straight to Peleus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Behind the army followed an extraordinary old man and a group of administrative officials.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now that the road to the hinterland of Thessaly has been opened, the Theonian army finally slowed down its advance to attack the city of Peleus. After all, after capturing the city of Peleus, ships carrying supplies can enter the port. , there will be no hidden dangers in the army's logistical supplies.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But just as the Theonian army was preparing to attack the city, Peleus's city gate opened.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After witnessing the landing of the Theonian army until now, the number of enemies frightened the people of Peleus, not to mention that there were no young and middle-aged citizens in the city as the main force to fight. They had already lost their fighting spirit, and surrender was expected.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the officials of Peleus asked the Theonian army not to harm the people in the city with fear, the old man at the head said kindly: "Don't worry, as long as you cooperate fully and do not have any hostile behavior, we will definitely guarantee The safety of your lives and property!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this point, the old man looked at the officials of Peleus who were still a little uneasy, and said meaningfully: "Let me tell you a secret, this is our great king Davos. His hometown, he grew up in Derix..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Peleus officials were shocked and at a loss. After a while, an old man from Peleus said softly: "Derix... that is a village near the Macedonian border. The village was destroyed by the Macedonians decades ago..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the old man's reminder, the officials suddenly remembered that such a village seemed to have existed: Peleus was squeezed out by other city-states in Thessaly during that period. , and unwilling to be confined to this small depression, they took advantage of the Macedonians being involved in the Peloponnesian War and quietly built villages north along the coast to expand their territory.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But as soon as the Peloponnesian War ended, the Macedonians quickly sent troops to destroy the villages and plunder the people. Peleus had to humiliate himself and sue for peace...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This was more than 30 years ago. The ruins of the village of Derix It was covered with weeds, and there were no traces of human habitation. Many Peleus people had forgotten this painful memory, but they never expected that a king would walk out of that remote village!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Before I came here, His Majesty the King once warned me that as long as the people of Peleus sincerely surrender, they will never be allowed to suffer any harm, because that is his hometown and the people there are his fellow villagers!" The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   old man said solemnly .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After saying that, the Peleus officials not only eliminated their worries, but also led the Theonian army into the city with joyful faces, as if they were not forced to surrender, but were welcoming friendly forces.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But in fact, King Davos never said such a thing at all. The old man still clearly remembers the conversation when King Davos summoned him that day: "Hilos, I heard that you have been very busy recently and come home very late every day. ?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
