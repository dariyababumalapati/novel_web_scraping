   Asisters took him to a map of northern Etruria on the table, pointed at the map and said: "At dusk, I received a message from Hass Drupa sent a messenger from the Florentia military camp. A large number of Gauls appeared there. The specific number is not yet clear. Hasdrubal estimated that it would not be less than 20,000. Then I A messenger was received from the Lucca military camp. Gauls also appeared there, and their number exceeded 10,000. Apart from this, no other information was received... This is the current situation." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   No receipt. News about the Aretium military camp?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Not yet."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Patroclus once visited the border legion to inspect the military quality of the soldiers in that legion. He believed that if Gauls appeared near the Aretium military camp, They would definitely respond quickly. It was impossible not to be able to send out a messenger, so he pondered for a moment and made his own judgment: "It seems that this time the Gauls will come from the north of the northern border of Etruria." The invasion is probably from the Senones tribe in Gaul again!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The possibility of the Senones is very high, but the Salvis tribe has also been harassing Etruria in recent years. If this time The number of invading Gauls is too large, and the possibility of Sarvis being involved cannot be ruled out."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Patroclus nodded.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since Theonia entered the Latium region, Asistes and the others began to collect a large amount of information about the Gauls, the biggest threat to the kingdom in the north, and finally figured out the identity of the Gauls in Italy. origin.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Gauls originally lived north of the Alps. Many years ago (the Gauls had no chronology and writing, so the specific age cannot be determined) the Gauls north of the Alps were under the rule of the wise chief Abigail. Next, there was peace and tranquility and life was prosperous, so the population skyrocketed. The output of the original land could not support the excessive population, so Abigatus decided to let the excess population colonize new lands, and finally selected a few young and promising people. Young men serve as leaders, and draw lots to decide where they will colonize.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Belovusus, the son of Abigatus's sister, was drawn to the south of the colonial Alps. This was undoubtedly extremely bad luck for the Gauls at that time, because the Alps were inaccessible and difficult to navigate, and it was difficult to cross them. It was a huge risk, not to mention that no one knew what the situation would be like south of the Alps.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Belovisus was young and courageous. Under his encouragement, the young people of the six tribes he was supposed to lead were also not afraid of difficulties, and they resolutely went south.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After going through many hardships, he discovered the famous Taurini Pass, crossed the Alps and entered northern Italy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   They drove away the original owners, the Etruscans, and settled down with Mediolanium (modern Milan) as the center. They called themselves "Salves" and gradually spread outward. expansion.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Many years later, the Gallic tribes north of the Alps heard that Belovisus was living a good life after taking people to settle in the south, and they were a little moved. Then the Gauls headed by the Knomani tribe settled in Etito. Under the leadership of Chief Vius, they also crossed the Alps and entered northern Italy. With the help of the Salvis, they settled east of it with Verona as the center.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the following ten years, these two large tribes rapidly expanded to the surrounding areas, defeating the Etruscans in the north many times and forcing them to move southward. This also caused the Etruscans, who were originally the overlords of central and northern Italy, to People begin to decline.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   More than ten years later, another large Gallic tribe north of the Alps, the Senones, decided to move south into northern Italy, but at this time there was no extra open space in the Po River plain.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The upper reaches were occupied by the Ligurians, the lower reaches were occupied by the Veneti, and the central part, the most vast and fertile land, was occupied by the two major tribes of Gaul, the Sarvis and the Cnomani. The Nones had no choice but to cross the Po River and enter the southern hilly and mountainous areas, driving the Etruscans in the mountains further south, and settled with Bologna as the center (bonoma, modern Bologna).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the years that followed, the Senones south of the Po River thought of taking the lower Po River plain occupied by the Veneti as their own. They launched wars against the Veneti many times. They also captured some land from the Veneti, but in the end they were unable to do anything to the Veneti people. This was because at this time, the lower reaches of Bohe were full of swamps, water networks were crisscrossed, and the land was muddy. The Gauls, who were originally a mountain race, were here. They are not used to fighting, and although the Veneti people are not native to the Po River Plain, they have been familiar with the environment here for hundreds of years after migrating from Illyria on the other side of the Adriatic Sea. After suffering a lot of losses, the Senones finally decided to restore long-term peace with the Veneti.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Ligurians in the upper reaches are said to be a branch of the Celts, who migrated to Italy along the coast very early, but they have never been able to achieve unity, and the tribes often fight with each other, but they also Extremely exclusive.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Salvis invaded many times and were met with tenacious counterattacks. As a result, the Salvis discovered that these Ligurians were smaller than them, but as strong as them and more ferocious than them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After suffering several major defeats and finding that the Ligurians were not easy to deal with, the Salvis finally had to restore peace with the Ligurians.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As a result, the Gauls looked around and found that the Etruscans in the south were the best to bully.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, after decades of development, coupled with the occasional addition of small Gaul tribes who crossed over from the north of the mountain, the population of southern Gaul increased several times, especially for the Senone who lived in the hilly and mountainous areas. For the Si tribes, they occupied less and poorer land, had a stronger need to expand their territories, and their gathering places were closer to the Etruscans.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, around 390 BC, under the leadership of the great leader Brunum, the Senones climbed over the rolling mountains, invaded the Etruscan territory, and defeated the main force of Rome in the Battle of Aria, and finally They captured the city of Rome, but then they fell into the quagmire of war.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Brunum finally decided to lead his people to retreat from Rome and return home, he was forced to engage in a hasty battle with the pursuing Latium army led by Camillus. In the end, the Senones were defeated miserably. , were attacked by the Etruscans along the way, and less than half of the people fled back to their hometown.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The great leader Brunlum was also seriously injured and died of illness shortly after returning to Boroma. As a result, the Thelonese tribe not only suffered a great loss in strength, but also fell into chaos for a period of time. After that, the northern border of Etruria was quiet for many years. A lot.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It is said that during that period, even if the Senones tribe wanted to go south to plunder, they usually had to enlist the Salvis tribe to support them, thus making the relationship between the two major tribes of Southern Gaul even closer.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After more than 10 years of recuperation, the Senones should have recovered a lot of their strength, so they have begun to intensify their invasion of Etruria in recent years.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just the invasion of a Senones did not worry Asistes, but if the more powerful Sarvis also joined, it would have to attract the attention of the kingdom.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I believe that by tomorrow, we will get more news about the Gauls, which will be more helpful for us to formulate countermeasures. But what I am worried about now is that there are so many Gauls invading, and the border legions led by Lord Hasdrubal... ...Can you hold on to the barracks before our reinforcements arrive?" Asistes said with some worry. There were some words in his heart that he did not say: Hasdrubal is a relative of your Majesty, and he has just returned from the army. The fact that the Carthaginian can directly serve as the commander of the army shows that King Davos attaches great importance to him. If he is killed in this Gaulish invasion, I am afraid that King Davos will be angry.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Don't worry, sir. The three military camps in the north are as solid as fortresses, and their defense facilities are also very complete, no less than those of Paragonia back then. As far as I know, the Gauls' siege ability is not strong. Even if they have a large number of soldiers, it is not easy to break through the military camp. Hasdrubal, the commander of the army, can definitely hold on until our reinforcements arrive!" Patroclus said with confidence.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I hope so, but we must seize the time to send troops. When the 14th Legion and the reserve soldiers from the Roman area are gathered together, how many people can there be?" Asistes asked seriously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "33,250 people." Patroclus immediately said a number.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   More than 33,000 people are enough to form 4 legions. This number is indeed astonishing for a region that was incorporated into the Kingdom of Theonia not long ago. However, the population of young adults in the Roman region (especially Rome) was already large when it surrendered to the Kingdom. Many, at that time, tens of thousands of troops (Roman reserve brigade and Roman noble soldiers) could easily be formed to follow the main force of the Theonian army to fight. Later, Davos designated Latium as an area that the kingdom needed to focus on development, whether it was Newly transferred formal citizens and newly adult citizens of the kingdom are given priority in this area. Therefore, in recent years, the Roman area has been the fastest growing area in the entire kingdom.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As the administrator of the region, Asistes was not surprised. He pondered and said: "If all the allies give full support, there will be about 50,000 to 60,000 people. Even if they come half, there will be 20,000 to 30,000 people. Plus With our own army, I think it is possible to defeat the invading Gauls with only the strength of the Roman region. This was also the goal that His Majesty hoped to achieve when he established the Theonian League in central Italy."&#13;
