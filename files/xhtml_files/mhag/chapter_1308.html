   Chapter 1308 On the Eve of the Decisive Battle&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even though Henepolis's tone of voice was gentle when he translated, Davos still raised his eyebrows after listening to it, snorted heavily, and said angrily: "Go back and tell Artaxerxes that I accepted his offer. "Your Majesty&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !" Alexis interrupted him eagerly: "We can't agree! The reason why the Persians dared to issue a letter of challenge must have been prepared. We cannot agree rashly, we must Think carefully to avoid falling into their tricks!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, Your Majesty!" Felicius also advised: "Although the 'millions of troops' mentioned in the letter is definitely a boast, the number of Persian troops is indeed We are greatly surpassed by us. We cannot rush into battle. We should first hold the camp and then look for fighters-" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Nonsense!" Lizaru stood up and retorted: "Although the Persian army is large in number, it is timid and afraid of fighting; our army Although there are few people, they advance bravely. Therefore, we should take advantage of the high morale of the soldiers to start a battle with the Persian army, instead of blindly defending, otherwise the pressure on logistics supply will increase..." "Is&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Lizaru right? Wrong! We are deep in the enemy's territory, and only by moving forward bravely can we win the final victory! Any hesitation and delay will only put the entire army in trouble!..." Matonis also expressed his opinions loudly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a while, the entire big tent became lively, which seemed to be no different from what Trebasus had heard outside the tent before. Dozens of generals were divided into two groups, supporting or opposing the battle. The two sides argued endlessly. Unanimity is difficult to achieve.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Trebasus saw with his own eyes that King Theonia tried to stop him several times, but it didn't work. It wasn't until the guards around him beat a drum hard that everyone stopped making noise.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos stood up and said loudly with some embarrassment: "Don't fight, you all, I have already decided! Persians, go back and tell your king that the decisive battle will take place in two days!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Trebasus walked out of Dioni When he arrived at the sub-camp, his steps were brisk and his mood was relaxed, because he not only completed the task assigned by the King of Persia and successfully got the King of Theonia to accept the letter of war, but he also passed this mission, Learned about the reality of the Theonian army: they were not as good at fighting as rumored, the soldiers were tired of fighting, the generals were arrogant and untamable, and the Theonian king was not as strong as the rumors, he could not even be completely convinced and driven His generals...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Trebassus felt deeply that the flaws revealed by the Theonian army would greatly increase the chances of the Persian army's victory. He was very pleased that it was worthwhile to take the risk of sending an envoy to the Theonian military camp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He eagerly mounted his horse, eager to return to the station immediately and report his findings to the King of Persia, but he was completely unaware of the proud smile on the face of Henepolis who was standing at the gate of the camp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the Persian envoy left the big tent, the big tent became lively again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "How was my performance just now?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Matonis, I really didn't realize it. You can definitely be an actor at the Thurii Theater!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haha, there is no need to be an actor. I only care about the Persians. You won't be fooled. After all, we urgently mobilized so many people and spent so much energy to stage this scene, it can't be in vain!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I have been observing the Persian envoy just now. Every time we talk, his His expression will change a little. He probably understands Greek, which just shows that he is paying attention to the situation in our camp." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So no matter how cunning the Persians are, they can't escape His Majesty's plan!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   waiting for the generals. After a heated discussion for a while, Davos coughed lightly, and the entire tent suddenly became quiet. Compared with the time when the Persian envoy was there before, it was a huge difference.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked around at the crowd and said in a deep voice: "Everyone, let us now discuss the strategy for a decisive battle with Persia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   " ...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the early morning of November 3, 364 BC (the 30th year of the Kingdom of Theonia), "Woooooooooo..." the sharp bugle sound suddenly sounded, and the originally peaceful Theonia camp quickly became lively.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Brothers, don't sleep in, get up quickly!..." Just as the captains were waking up their soldiers, the chefs in the army's supply camps had already begun to prepare breakfast for the soldiers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the bugle sounded, Davos immediately woke up from his sleep. When he saw the guards entering the tent, his first question was: "How is the weather outside?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, the weather is very good, it is not raining. , and there is no wind."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It's a good weather for fighting!" Davos sighed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the Theonian army entered the Mesopotamian plains, the four seasons became somewhat distinct. The temperature in early autumn here was a little low, the air was drier, there were more sunny days and less rainy days, all of which were detrimental to the Daionian army, which was mainly heavy infantry. The battle of the Onian army was favorable. The only disadvantage was that it was often windy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After washing up, the guard brought breakfast: a bowl of sticky oatmeal porridge, a bowl of hot bustard and donkey soup, half a piece of steamed sturgeon meat, two large pieces of bread with cheese...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Henepolis entered the tent, Seeing Davos staring at the dinner plate in a daze, he immediately said: "Your Majesty, don't worry, the soldiers' breakfast is almost the same as yours! In order to meet your requirements, the supply camp spent a day fishing on the Euphrates River yesterday. The cavalry ran hundreds of miles north before capturing some wild beasts..." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The outcome of a battle mainly depends on careful preparation before the battle." Davos picked up a piece of bread and said seriously: "Today's victory This battle will probably be very long, and the soldiers must eat enough food to have enough physical strength to support it. Considering that the formation alone may last until noon, Felicius had notified the supply camp yesterday to let them Prepare more bread and let the soldiers carry it to the battlefield and have a snack before the battle." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Listening to what you said, Your Majesty, I am full of confidence in winning this battle, because the King of Persia cannot be like us. Prepare such rich food for his huge army." Henipolis flattered, then sat on the wooden chair next to him, hesitated, and then said: "...I heard that people here prohibit the catching of this kind of fish, saying It is a divine object and will anger the gods..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The angrier the enemy gods are, the happier the great Hades will be." Davos said calmly, took a big bite of fish and chewed a few Next, spit out the fish bone: "Have you finished breakfast?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I've finished eating early." Henipolis complained: "Your Majesty, I'm not like you. No matter how big the battle is, I can treat it as normal. I was so excited that I didn't fall asleep all night. I got up early today. You Look at me, the circles under my eyes are still dark."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You, you..." Davos looked at the funny look on his eyes as he pointed at them, and smiled.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He finished breakfast and chatted with Henepolis for a while. The captain of the palace guard came in and reported: "Your Majesty, the legions have begun to line up to leave the camp."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then Davos put on his armor and walked out of the tent. The guards had already led him his horse.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is a Lusitanian stallion in its prime. It is fat and strong, with smooth, brown fur. It is also extremely tall. It keeps pawing the soil with its front hooves and shakes its head and neck, as if it does not want to be beaten. But when Davos walked up to it, it immediately calmed down, lowered its head, leaned close to Davos, and hummed softly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos patted its face and said with a smile: "Hey, Nicky, you are going to fight with me again."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Nicky seemed to understand, rubbed Davos' hand, and then raised his head , neighing joyfully.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since coming to this world, this is the fifth war horse that Davos has ridden, and it is most likely the last one.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos patted the horse's back with emotion, then got on his horse and left the inner camp under the escort of 1,000 fully armed palace guards.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Dozens of people gathered at the exit. When they saw Davos coming, someone couldn't help shouting: "Your Majesty, we have been waiting for almost half an hour. Why did you just come out? The soldiers have already left the camp!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the man lying on the carriage was a little rude, Davos was not angry and said with a smile: "Amintas, your hot temper has not changed even when you are old. Don't worry, we are not here, the battle is not going to happen." It will begin."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty!" Hieronymus, Epithenes, Geogris, Martius and others immediately stepped forward to salute.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked at them and asked: "Brothers, are you ready to fight?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thirty years ago, Davos became the leader of the mercenaries and after completely winning the trust of the mercenaries, he would often say this before a battle. At this moment, the veterans heard mixed emotions in their ears. After a moment, they shouted excitedly: "Ready!!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos waved his right hand forward vigorously: "Let's go!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After meeting with the veterans, , the entire team passed through the spacious camp passage and quickly left the camp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Theonian army did not gather together before setting off, but each legion was led by the legion commander and set off. After setting up their own camp, they headed directly to the predetermined battlefield, so more than 20 teams were marching eastward almost side by side.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Because they had just eaten breakfast and in order not to waste energy, each team moved very slowly. The soldiers were joking and chatting in the team. The team officers did not stop it and even took the initiative to stir up the topic. If someone did not know the inside story, People looked at it and thought they were going on an outing instead of engaging in a life-and-death battle.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   More than an hour later, each team gradually walked out of Taposakus and the surrounding areas that had been burned by the Persians, and set foot on the plains intertwined with green and yellow.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After walking for a while, the army commanders sent an order: "Stop advancing and rest where you are!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Is this the location of the battle? I don't think there is anything special about it." "I&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   heard that the Persian army's camp is 25 miles away from our camp. , I just calculated silently, this place is about eleven or two miles away from the camp, right in the middle, isn't it the battlefield?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
