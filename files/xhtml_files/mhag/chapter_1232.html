   Chapter 1232 All previous efforts were wasted.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Due to the turbulent situation in the kingdom after the death of Cyrus the Younger, Artaxerxes did not severely punish the officials and nobles of Asia Minor who had supported Cyrus the Younger, but he was always wary of Asia Minor.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He originally hoped that Tissaphernes, whom he trusted, could bring Asia Minor back under his complete control, but he did not expect that the Spartan king Agesilaus invaded Asia Minor. Tissaphernes lost consecutive battles and hated the consequences. The Queen Mother of Persia, who had killed Cyrus the Younger, took the opportunity to execute him. Artaxerxes deliberately became angry and did not help Asia Minor. In fact, he secretly hoped that after Asia Minor was completely destroyed by the Spartans, he would pick up the pieces again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Unexpectedly, the Corinthian War broke out and Agesilaus had to return to Greece early. However, the nobles and people of Asia Minor, whose homes were destroyed, complained a lot because of the inaction of the Persian royal court.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In particular, in order to retaliate against Sparta, Pharnabazus, another governor of Asia Minor, asked the Athenian general Conon, who once lived under his roof, to lead his fleet to directly assist Athens in fighting Sparta. Conon even sent the entire The fleet was taken over by Athens, and he pretended to turn a blind eye.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Unexpectedly, Artaxerxes accepted the advice of his advisers and supported Sparta, and also asked Pharnabazus to take back the warships he had given to Athens.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This aroused strong dissatisfaction in Pharnabazus, who not only disobeyed orders, but also refused to recognize Sparta as an ally of Persia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since Pharnabazus was a great nobleman in Asia Minor and had considerable influence in western Persia, Artaxerxes eventually had to marry his daughter to Pharnabazus' son to appease this man. Governor, but since then the rift between Asia Minor and the Persian court has deepened.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Persian officials transferred to Asia Minor by the Persian royal court never received the cooperation of the local nobles and people, and Artaxerxes had also been deliberately weakening the local power in Asia Minor, such as conquering the mountains of Dukia and invading Egypt... Artaxerxes Xerxes asked Asia Minor to provide more troops and supplies. The key is that every major war ended in failure, causing Asia Minor to suffer great losses. One can imagine the resentment in the hearts of the nobles and the people.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Moreover, the failure of these wars also reduced the prestige of the Persian royal court, allowing the governors and nobles of Asia Minor to grow in ambition.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In this invasion of Egypt, although Artaxerxes did not ask Asia Minor to provide more soldiers, he did ask them to fully support Sparta and Athens. This was also a huge consumption of materials, and finally triggered a rebellion. , not only Frisia rebelled, but Lydia, Mysia, Cilicia, Bithynia, Lycia, Pisidia... most of the eastern and western regions of Asia Minor rebelled, and it even spread to Syria.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   To be honest, Artaxerxes is very upset now. He originally planned to launch an attack on Egypt in two or three years, because by then the turmoil caused by the Dukians had passed and the domestic situation was more stable. The military preparations for Egypt are also more complete. Under such circumstances, the governors of Asia Minor, faced with the huge military advantage of the Persian royal court, may not dare to such a blatant rebellion, but he learned that "the Theonian army invaded the Peloponnese" After the news that he had an absolute advantage in the battle with Sparta, he could not sit still. Once Theonia controlled the Greek mainland, it would be more difficult for Persia to successfully conquer Egypt. They had to take advantage of the period when the Theonian army was contained in mainland Greece to launch an attack on Egypt in advance, but unexpectedly it triggered a rebellion in Asia Minor.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Trebassus, there is a rebellion in Asia Minor now. Do you have...well, what suggestions?" Artaxerxes looked at the brocade box on the table that contained the head of Timotheus, with a seemingly angry expression. He still couldn't hide his nervousness.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, the kingdom's army is fighting in Egypt. There are insufficient troops in the Mesopotamia plain. Once the rebels in Asia Minor march eastward, they may threaten the royal capital..." Trebassus is worthy of being the favorite of the King of Persia. , knowing very well what the King of Persia was worried about at this moment, he continued: "Your Majesty, I think the generals fighting on the front line will definitely write to you when they know the news of the rebellion in Asia Minor, to put down the rebellion and restore peace to the kingdom as soon as possible! "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Artaxerxes nodded with satisfaction and said: "You go and make arrangements."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As the most noble king of Persia, he had lost his prestige when he returned from the previous expedition to Dukya in person. This time he conquered Egypt in person. If it happens again, If he returns without success, he will be ridiculed by his countrymen. Of course, if the generals collectively write a letter asking to suspend the war against Egypt and he reluctantly agrees, he can save some face.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Trebassus left his account, Artaxerxes remembered that Theonia had conquered the Greek mainland and established a new Greek alliance. However, he had prepared a military plan to conquer Egypt for several years, but because of the rebellion, And had to stop... The more he thought about it, the angrier he became. He couldn't help but punched the wooden table angrily. The brocade box turned over, and the bloody head of Timothy rolled out, and the pair of eyes that had lost their luster His eyes were just open, as if he were staring at the Persian king indifferently.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Artaxerxes was suddenly startled and shouted in panic: "Take it away quickly! Take it away!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The eunuch in the tent hurriedly put the head into a brocade box and handed it to the guards outside the tent.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Another eunuch asked with concern: "Your Majesty, you are tired and need a good rest. Do you want Princess Atosha to take care of you?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After all, Artaxerxes is old and needs someone to take care of him when he goes out to fight. Therefore, he took his most beloved and youngest princess Atosha (also his daughter) with him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, after venting his extreme emotions, Artaxerxes felt his head was heavy and his limbs were weak, so he nodded.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On January 1, 369 BC (the 25th year of the Kingdom of Dioria), a large number of people poured into the port of Philae in Thessaly. Merchant ships, although since Theonia conquered all of Thessaly, the number of merchant ships from Theonia is increasing every month, but the scene of blocking the entire port like today has never appeared.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Cabrias finally got off the ship and began to complain: "Since the Theonians notified us to come to Thessaly, they should make all preparations in advance. How could the order at the port be so chaotic and delay our journey?" For half a day, it would be too ungraceful to say that they were teasing us as if they were victors!" "I'm afraid&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   the Theonians did not expect that the city-states, including us, would immediately respond as soon as they received the notice. Send an envoy to Philae..." Callistratus said sadly while looking at the various docks in the port.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Kabulias heard this, he immediately understood: "It seems that they are just like us and want to rush over as soon as possible to gain more benefits for their city-state before the alliance meeting starts and the covenant is signed. "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   From this incident, we can see how powerful the Kingdom of Theonia is in Greece now..." Callistratus sighed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kabulias was silent for a moment: Yes, first defeated Sparta, then conquered Thessaly, then defeated the Greek coalition forces and forced Athens to surrender... Moreover, now the local people in Greece already know that Theonia is trying to make Greece They surrendered and sent more than 100,000 troops and thousands of warships. How could such a powerful military force not make the Greek people tremble!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Eh? Cabrias, you have good eyesight. See if that person is Agesilaus?!" Callistratus suddenly pointed to the side.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Cabrias looked at it intently and shouted excitedly: "Yes, it's Agesilaus!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Let's go and catch up with him!" Callistratos immediately called to his followers to pick up their luggage. Rush forward quickly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the two met not too far away, the flow of people at the port was so dense that they didn't catch up with each other until they entered the city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Bless Athena, I'm glad to see you again, King Agesilaus!" Callistratus said sincerely. During the signing of the "Peace of Callias", the two had a tacit cooperation. , when Sparta was conquered by Theonia, there were rumors that Agesilaus died in battle, and he was sad about it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I'm not happy to see you." Agesilaus said unceremoniously: "You know when the news of Athens' surrender to Theonia reached Sparta, I was so painful that I almost wanted to commit suicide. Fortunately, we survived in the end."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The power of the Theonians is too strong! The people of Athens were besieged for less than a month, and they strongly demanded surrender. If we don't agree, I'm afraid the people's anger will be vented on us. ..." Callistratus recalled the scene at that time, and he was still a little palpitating. He couldn't help but said: "A Theonia that has only been established for a few decades can become so powerful. Among them are you Spar. As the most powerful city-state in Greece, you should have strangled it in the cradle instead of letting it grow, otherwise there would not be today's disaster!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Can you blame us!" Agassiz Rouse retorted dissatisfied: "If you Athenians hadn't been plotting behind the scenes, encouraging Corinth and Thebes to go against us again and again, so that we couldn't deal with Theonia at all, how could it be possible? Today! In the final analysis, this is all your fault in Athens!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing that the two were about to quarrel, Cabrias quickly stepped forward to persuade: "Please calm down, both of you! What's the point of arguing about these things now, no matter whether it's Athens , or Sparta are just fish on the Theonia chopping board.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Upon hearing this, the two were immediately discouraged: Athens and Sparta had been fighting for decades, with countless casualties, but the hegemony of Greece was finally defeated by a Usurped by foreign upstarts, all their ambitions and dreams have come to nothing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
