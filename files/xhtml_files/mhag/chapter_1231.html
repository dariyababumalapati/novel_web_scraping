   Chapter 1231 Rebellion in Asia Minor&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But the Temple of Zeus in Olympia is one of the oldest and most magnificent temples in the Mediterranean. The Olympia Games are the oldest Greek games. Since it, the Greek world has its own chronology (with the Olympia Games The games are also the games with the largest number of participants and the widest range of city-states participating in them. Olympia and Delphi have always been symbols of Greek culture that connect Greek city-states all over the Mediterranean.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It stands to reason that Clotokatax would use the same method as Delphi to appease Olympia, but Olympia worships the god king Zeus, while the Theonians firmly believe that Hades is the king of the gods. , there is a fundamental opposition between the two, which determines that this will never be a peaceful visit.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   You must know that Davos once personally sent instructions on how to deal with Olympia. Crotocatacus found it unacceptable after reading it. Patroclus once expressed his willingness to carry out the plan on his behalf. After two days of painful thinking, Prince Theonia finally decided to go in person, because he kept in mind the words written in his father's letter: "... As a king, you should not only enjoy flowers and wine, but also bear the infamy and reputation when necessary. Disclaimer, the road to prosperity through the kingdom has never been smooth sailing, iron and blood are indispensable!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Olympia is located in the southern part of the Elis region, at the confluence of the Alfios and Kladeos rivers , except for the Temple of Zeus, the Temple of Hera, the priests' housing, and a meeting hall for city-state representatives and winners to gather and celebrate, the rest of its holy land is a place for competitions. There are no villages inhabited by civilians, with sycamore trees, Olive trees, willows, and pine trees grow lushly in the open space between the buildings, filling it with a mountain atmosphere.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When there are no major sacrificial activities, Olympia seems a little sparsely populated, giving people a sense of isolation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The army that followed Crotocataxus to Olympia was more than double that at Delphi, and more than half of them were former Helots who came from Messenia and Lagnia. They conquered Olympia. Surrounded, murderous.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax forcibly summoned the priests of Zeus, put on a fierce look, and threatened them: other city-states have confessed that the war between them and Theonia was caused by the priests of Olympia Deliberately instigated, Theonia came to hold the Olympian priests accountable for the war, unless they were willing to promise that from now on they would no longer declare Zeus as the god king, and were willing to accept the sacred kingdom of Theonia in name. Under the supervision of the Temple of Dis, they will be exempted from their guilt and can continue to serve Zeus as noble priests and continue to host the Olympian Games. Otherwise, they will be charged with war criminals, stripped of their status as priests, and expelled from Olympia. , no city-state in the New Hellenic Alliance is allowed to take them in (Davos originally asked Crotokatax to execute the Olympian priests who refused to cooperate to achieve the effect of killing them, but the kind-hearted Crotokatax will It was changed to expulsion).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Zeus is the king of gods, but the priests of Zeus in Olympia are not only not strong, but also often criticized.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ellis and Pisa often fought wars in order to gain control of Olympia, and from time to time they asked Olympian priests to express their opinions. They were like grassroots, supporting whichever side was stronger, and immediately changed their tune once the situation changed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The same is true when hosting the Olympia Games.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the past, when there was a conflict between Ellis and Sparta, Ellis used his status as the owner of Olympia to expel the Spartan athletes and not allow them to compete. The priests did not dare to object; soon after, Sparta led the army Rushing to Olympia, they expelled the Eleans, and then announced that "all competition results before the games are held again are invalid." The priests also only praised it... Such ridiculous things have happened many times in the past.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It was precisely because of understanding these situations that Clotokatax dared to accept this task, because he felt that the Olympian priests who had been compromising for a long time in such an environment should not have many strong bones.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   His judgment was not wrong. Except for a few young priests who were expelled because of their firm opposition, the other priests chose to surrender.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since then, Delphi and Olympia, the two major holy places in mainland Greece, have been dominated by the Holy Kingdom of Theonia like other city-states in mainland Greece.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;

   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On this day, after Timothy led the fleet to patrol the near east coast and returned to Tyre, he found the messenger of the King of Persia waiting at the dock as soon as he got off the ship. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty wants to summon me?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, Your Majesty has something important to discuss with you!" the messenger said solemnly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Excuse me, what is the important matter?" Timothy couldn't help but ask again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Don't ask any more questions. Come with us and go see the king!" the messenger urged impatiently.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Timotheus looked at the arrogant messenger and the group of Persian royal guards behind him who were wearing gorgeous armor and holding their heads high. He couldn't help but cursed in his heart: The pure Persian nobles all looked like this and regarded the Greeks as human beings. Barbarians.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Timothy had lived in Persia for many years and was accustomed to this. Although he had some doubts in his heart, he still followed the envoy to the residence of the King of Persia without hesitation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The king of Persia was stationed in Damascus east of Phoenicia, but it was not in a town, but in a camp. The lively and noisy scene of thousands of troops gathering here no longer exists, because several One hundred thousand Persian main forces are far away from this place and have been fighting in Egypt for nearly two months. Only the Persian king and his royal family, entourage, and ministers continue to stay here. Although there are 10,000 of the most elite undead troops guarding here, But compared with this huge camp, it still seems too sparse.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing empty tents everywhere, Timothy couldn't help but come up with an idea: If the Egyptians sent a surprise army to bypass the main Persian force and raid here, they could be burned to ashes with a single fire.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Timothy quickly suppressed this strange thought, because they had approached the center of the camp, guarded by strong, well-equipped undead soldiers, who always looked at everyone who tried to enter the camp with suspicion. Even though there were envoys to lead the way, Timothy still went through several strict inspections before being allowed to enter the residence of the King of Persia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Persian king's tent stood like a house in the center of the camp. Its appearance was magnificently decorated, and the Persian king's flag, the golden eagle, stood high in front.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The King of Persia often entertained guests in his big tent, and Timothy once attended. The sumptuous food, graceful dancing girls, and beautiful music... were evocative.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But at that time, Timothy was still a little uneasy. He felt that the Persian king was a little too optimistic about this war. It seemed that he could conquer Egypt quickly by conquering Egypt himself.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Timothy's premonition was correct. The battle lasted for nearly two months. The huge army had been blocked on the east bank of the Nile, and the navy's warships had not yet found a chance to break through the fortresses and water gates at the mouths of the Nile's tributaries and enter the Nile. The heart of the delta.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, he heard the roar coming from the big tent, and suddenly felt uneasy: Could it be that the King of Persia called him here this time because he had not achieved any big results in the two months since he had been the fleet commander, and wanted to deal with it? He reprimanded?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The more Timothy thought about it, the more guilty he felt. He even felt that the palace guards outside the tent looked at him a little strangely.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, bring here the commander of the navy, Timothy!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Tie up this Greek who is trying to rebel!" Artaxerxes roared, and the well-prepared guards immediately pushed Timothy down. He tied it into a rice dumpling and dragged it to Artaxerxes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Attempted rebellion?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ...Timotheus became a prisoner with a confused look on his face, and could only cry out in panic that he was wronged.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Unjustly accused?!" Artaxerxes roared angrily: "Aliobazenis rebelled. He had already planned it, so he asked you to bring such a small army here to deceive me! I am really blind, You actually appointed you as the commander-in-chief of the Persian fleet! As a result, you deliberately delayed the war and wasted two months of my time, but gave the traitor enough time to prepare! Damn Greek barbarians, I'm sorry I trusted you so much!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The more Artaxerxes spoke, the angrier he became. He stepped forward and kicked Timotheus to the ground: "Drag him out and chop him!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The guard stepped forward, grabbed Timotheus' hair, and dragged him out. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Timothy endured the pain and cried out sadly: "Ariobarzenis harmed me!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Knowing that there was no possibility of survival, he simply yelled: "Artaxerxes, you are stupid and incompetent. King, no wonder your brother wants to usurp the throne, and your ministers want to rebel. As long as you reign for one day, Persia will never have peace!..." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kill him quickly! Kill him!..." Artaxerxes was furious. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a while, the head of Timotheus was presented. Artaxerxes was still angry and said in a hateful voice: "Cut off his hands again, and send them to Ariobazenis along with his head." Send it!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This was done because Artaxerxes remembered that he had disposed of the body of his brother Cyrus the Younger in this way, and was so angry that his mother, who loved Cyrus the Younger, fell seriously ill.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He even believed that the rebellion in Asia Minor was caused by his younger brother, because his father appointed Cyrus the Younger as the military governor of western Persia. As a result, Cyrus, who was good at winning people's hearts, not only used the financial resources of Asia Minor to hire a group of Greeks to serve as He fought and won the support of almost all governors and nobles in Asia Minor, so he had the confidence to compete with him for the throne.&#13;
