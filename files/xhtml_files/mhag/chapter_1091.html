   Chapter 1091 The Jealousy of Athens&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "So who won the debate in the end?" Lysias asked curiously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plato said calmly: "You are familiar with Isocrates. You should know that Isocrates has a hoarse voice and is better at writing than speaking, so he sent his students to argue. Of course I also asked Spisippus Challenge... Judging&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   from the results of the debate, we should have won, but judging from subsequent developments, this did not clear the Athenian people's doubts about your Theonia, but instead increased their fear of Theonia. Trend, Isocrates has achieved his goal..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "In the past two years, Athens has been somewhat alienated from Theonia. What is the reason? Is it just because Theonia is stronger?" Ansitanos asked road.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "There are many reasons." Plato thought and said: "...Although Theonia has not set foot in the Greek mainland in recent years, it has signed a friendly agreement with Sparta for a long time, but refused to participate in two wars (the Corinthian War and the The subsequent Thebes War) formed an alliance with Athens and Thebes, which made the Athenians a little wary; more importantly, Athens' maritime trade has encountered competition from Theonia in recent years. Some of the same types of goods, Although the quality is almost the same, Theonia provides more quantities and lower prices, which makes Athens begin to lose some traditional city-state markets, such as Cyrenaica and Crete. This also makes many Athenian merchants and expatriates living in Athens The merchants were full of vigilance. With their instigation and support, the Athens Citizens' Assembly passed a resolution the year before last that 'the city-states joining the maritime alliance led by Athens shall not allow Theonian goods to enter the city-state market for sale'..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I know about this matter. Our Minister of Commerce Mariji once angrily made suggestions to His Majesty, asking to send envoys to protest to Athens, and also adopted the same means to counterattack, but His Majesty did not agree..." Ansitanos sighed with emotion. said.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "There is another reason." Plato looked at Davos who was listening: "Back then, Pericles called on the Greek city-states to build the city of Thurii. He originally hoped that this sub-state of Athens would become a pivotal city in the Western Mediterranean Magna Graecia. to expand the influence of Athens. Later, due to the decline of Athens caused by the Peloponnesian War, this goal was not achieved. Now Thurii has become the center of the Kingdom of Theonia and the center of the Western Mediterranean. Center, this may make some Athenian elites who want to restore the glory of the Periclean era harbor grudges..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I don't care whether Athens is wary of Theonia or not." At this time, Davos said, He watched Plato's reaction with a scrutinizing gaze: "I just want to know, Plato, do you think Theonia is a threat to Athens?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Dear King Davos." Plato said calmly: "In the same place. After the Socrates debate, I was a little confused, so this time I seriously traveled around the Kingdom of Theonia. What I saw and heard...all confirmed an idea in my mind-Theonia The Kingdom of Onia is not a threat to Athens, but the hope of Athens and even all Greek city-states!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plato's answer was somewhat beyond Davos's expectations. He blurted out in surprise: "Why?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plato answered with a serious look. : "The Greek mainland has a narrow territory, with many mountains and little land, and the land is barren, making survival difficult. The city-states on that land have been fighting for their own interests for decades, and the people have been exiled and the land has been desolate. If this continues, Each city-state will eventually die...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now it seems that if this bad situation is to be completely ended, a very powerful force must intervene to force Athens, Sparta, Thebes, Corinth and other city-states to stay in peace. If you dare to start disputes again, peace will come.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Persia cannot do that. It wants Greece to perish. Only in Theonia, you will treat the various city-states in mainland Greece equally like you treat the Samnites and Romans, and maybe even Flat highways were built between the mountains of mainland Greece, allowing trade between city-states to proceed more freely and conveniently on land and sea, allowing the people of each city-state to enjoy peace and tranquility under the order established by Theonia, Get a happier life..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plato's increasingly passionate voice echoed in the palace. Ansitanos and Lysias looked at each other. They did not expect Plato to have such great expectations for Theonia, which made them They felt excited but didn't know how to respond, so they looked at Davos together.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos tapped his fingers on the dining table and listened carefully, with no obvious mood swings on his face.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Plato finished speaking, he smiled faintly and said seriously: "For the Greek mainland, Theonia has no plans to interfere with its political situation for the time being." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I understand." Plato said knowingly: "I only hope that in my lifetime We can see that there can be long-term peace in Greece!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After that, everyone at the banquet had a tacit understanding not to talk about this matter anymore, but to talk about other topics.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the banquet was over, when Davos personally escorted Plato out of the palace, Plato said softly and drunkenly: "Dear King Davos, I remember that you accepted the employment of Cyrus the Younger, Prince of Persia, to go on an expedition to Persia. The Persian Royal Family Fighting for the throne, fighting each other, resulting in political turmoil, must have left a deep impression on you... Well, when I returned to Thurii, I heard many words of praise for Prince Apox, and Alcibiada Si also sincerely invited me to dinner several times, but I refused..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Oh." Davos responded calmly and said nothing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After seeing off Plato's master and apprentice, he returned to the palace and called Aristelas: "Tomorrow you go to the Ministry of Military Affairs and inform Alexis that the order for warships from the Alcibiades Shipyard is suspended."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes." Aristelas responded immediately without asking any more questions.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But Davos continued: "If Alcibiadas wants to ask the Ministry of Military Affairs why, you let Alexis answer, just say it was me who said, 'Since he doesn't want to concentrate on his business, then don't Do&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   it&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   .'"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A few days later, Davos, who returned to the mansion, was sitting in the study, thinking about the day's political affairs, when there was a knock on the door.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It's Apox, come in quickly!" Davos smiled kindly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Apox calmly sat down opposite Davos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked at his second son closely: Apox, who was only 17 years old, was taller and slender. He inherited more of the appearance from Agnes and was very delicate and handsome, but his eyebrows were filled with confidence and vitality. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Father, my uncle found me today and he told me." Abbocks was straightforward as soon as he opened his mouth.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos blinked and asked calmly: "Oh, what did he say?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Apox did not respond directly, but said loudly: "Father, I remember you once told me that a great scholar is more easily remembered by future generations than a king." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Yes, I said it. Everyone Everyone knows that Thales of Miletus was a sage, but no one remembers who the governor of Miletus was at that time..." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Father." Apox said with a sincere face: "I am very interested in the throne of Theonia. I have no interest, I am only interested in learning knowledge and studying scholarship! I only hope that in the future I can have more original ideas that can benefit the people and be admired by future generations! I can swear to Hades for this!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Apox said excitedly and raised his hands.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos held his shoulders forcefully, looked at him lovingly, and said softly: "Good boy, I have seen you since I was a child. Of course I know what you want! This time for Alcibida Such a small punishment is just because you are angry that he interfered with your concentration on your studies and destroyed the deep relationship between you and your elder brother! Don't worry, I not only respect your choice, but also fully support you. I hope you can become a college student in the future. A greater scholar than Thales, who illuminates the entire history of human cultural development!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Thank you, father, I will definitely work hard!" Apox was so excited by what Davos said that he finally calmed down his excitement and hesitated. After a while, he said, "Father... I have one more request."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Tell me, what request?" Davos smiled.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Apox scratched his head and his expression became awkward: "I think... I want to marry Nelia!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Who is Nelia?" Davos pretended to be surprised.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "...The daughter of Miltias, the former naval commander of the Fourth Fleet, and a classmate of Eunice." Apox mustered up the courage and finished in one breath.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Oh... have you discussed it with your mother?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Father, during this time, my uncle has been coming to my mother's place to talk to me about matchmaking, so I hope to get your consent first!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   That Nelia will agree to your proposal. "?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "She will definitely agree!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay, I agree, the wedding will be held when you become an adult." Davos agreed with a serious expression and straightforward words.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Thank you!" Apox gave Davos a strong hug excitedly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos smiled and patted his son's still immature shoulder, but he sighed in his heart: The children are all grown up, and each of them is getting married and having children, but he has already begun to grow old&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ... &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Sir, the mouth of the Kraty River will be arriving soon." The captain walked into the cabin and said to Haka who was resting.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I know." Haka slowly turned over and sat up, then put on a thick leather robe, stood up, and said to Hasdrubal, who was still drinking with his head down: "Brother, let's go outside and take a look together?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I won't go!" Hasdrubal replied harshly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka knew his temper, so he stopped trying to persuade him and slowly walked out of the cabin with the help of his servants.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
