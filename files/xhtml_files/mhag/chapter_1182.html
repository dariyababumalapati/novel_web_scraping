   Chapter 1182 Bad News&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus let out a long breath, his face looked a little pale, and he said absently: "Quick! Sound the retreat bugle!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The guard was stunned: "How can we have a retreat bugle?!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   " Only then did Geselaus come back to his senses and showed a silent wry smile. He made careful preparations for this battle and even learned some useful practices from the Theonian army:&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   For example, the commander did not He did not go to the front lines of the battle, but sat in the rear in order to fully understand and control the battle situation. Of course, other people served as commanders of the Spartan army. If he suddenly did this, he would be collectively despised by the Spartan warriors as a coward, but A Gesilaus is old and weak, so it is natural to sit in the rear;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   for another example, if you want to control the war situation and deal with emergencies, you must have a reserve team like Theonia, but whether it is Spartan warriors or Greek It was impossible for the mercenaries to accept not participating in the battle and watching on the sidelines, so Agesilaus decided to focus on the Thracian light shield soldiers. In fact, the Tegea army could also be regarded as his reserve... &#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But in the Greek army, including Sparta, the commander has always participated in the battle personally. Once the army is arrayed and the soldiers start to advance, the commander who is also in the battle array has lost control of the entire army. It seems that the arrows shot out can only last until the end of the battle. How could there be a special bugle call for retreat?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This was a war tradition for decades. Agesilaus could not temporarily add a trumpet sound, and it was impossible for the soldiers to adapt.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus thought about detaching some of the Thracian troops and returning to the left wing for rescue, but remembering the grievances of the Thracians just now, he felt that they would probably refuse to obey such an order again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   By now, Agesilaus realized that he was powerless about the development of the entire battle. He stood still for a moment, then suddenly bent down and grabbed the crutch next to the wooden chair, and said in a deep voice: "Let's go! Let's go to the right wing!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus said in a deep voice: "Let's go to the right wing!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Silas finally made up his mind to abandon the mercenaries in the center and left wing, and rushed to stay with his warriors, trying his best to guide them, who were about to be defeated, to escape safely back to Sparta.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus's judgment was not wrong.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since Olivers knew that the enemy he was facing was not a real Spartan warrior, he felt that he had been fooled. He ordered the trumpeter to continue to blow the attack bugle, and personally walked behind the army formation, loudly encouraging the soldiers to strengthen. Attack and let these enemies pretending to be Spartans know how powerful the Fourth Army is.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Encouraged by the legion commander, the soldiers of the Fourth Legion attacked more fiercely. The soldiers at the forefront even threw away their bayonet and held short swords to fight more closely with the enemy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The left wing of the Spartan military formation was made up of heavy infantry from Ionia and Asia Minor city-states. It was impossible to integrate them into one body with a uniform Spartan warrior attire. They were inherently different in battle. Lack of tacit understanding, but it was the first time to fight against the soldiers of the Theonian Legion. The skilled sword and shield attack skills of the Theonian Legion soldiers made it difficult for these mercenaries to cope with the battle. The casualties continued to increase, and the entire front began to It was crumbling, barely supported by the extra-thick columns.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The fierce attack on the flanks led by Taegtus led the mountain reconnaissance group was the last straw that broke the camel's back. The traditional Greek heavy infantry had strong defenses in frontal combat, but what they feared most was the attack from the rear. The heavy infantry in the array Because the infantrymen wore Corinthian helmets, their vision was narrow and their hearing was weakened, so their nerves became sensitive. Whenever there was any disturbance, their imaginations would start to wander. When panic spread quickly throughout the left wing of the Spartan army formation, the first sporadic retreats began. It didn't take long for the entire left to collapse.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Legion Commander, we have won! We took the lead in defeating the enemy!" the staff officer said excitedly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "There is nothing to be proud of. What we defeated was just an army of fake Spartans." Olivers said modestly, but with a smile on his face.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The collapse of the Spartan left wing eventually turned into a rout of the entire army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the Theban coalition won during the Battle of Leuctra, they did not achieve many results because they quickly withdrew their troops and returned to camp after the victory. However, the Theonian army has always had a tradition of expanding its results after winning the battle. , and Clotokatax, at the suggestion of Printors, also sent messengers to inform the commanders of each legion, asking them to urge each legion to continue the pursuit and eliminate as many Spartan warriors as possible.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Macedonian cavalry, which had been repelled by the First Cavalry Corps, had always been very tenacious. As long as the Theonian cavalry stopped chasing, they immediately stopped fleeing and made a gesture of returning to the battlefield, forcing the First Cavalry Corps to be in pursuit all the time. state, unable to escape to support the troops fighting on the battlefield.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now, the entire battlefield was filled with the defeated troops of Sparta. The Macedonian cavalry finally stopped entangled and truly fled away. The First Cavalry Corps also safely joined the team chasing the defeated troops.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The pursuit continued until the defeated soldiers finally fled into the mountains to the east and had to stop. The battle between the Theonian army and the Spartan coalition finally came to an end.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, it was already dusk, and the sun had exhausted its energy and was slowly falling into the mountains in the west. Its pale, heatless afterglow shone on the Taigea plain, which was originally beautiful with red flowers and green wheat, birds singing and butterflies flying. The countryside is now littered with corpses and blood. The screams of injured soldiers on the ground are intertwined with the cries of crows hovering in the sky, adding a bit of gloom and desolation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax was in a good mood. The Theonian army he led won the battle. Although most of the orders came from Printors' suggestions, he smiled a bit. , listened carefully to Staff Officer Muklu's report on the results of this battle: "The Spartan army left 2,150 corpses on the battlefield, 482 of which were Spartan warriors-" "How to tell that&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   they are Spartan warriors?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Badar warrior?" Crotokartax asked curiously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Highness, it is their tradition for Spartan warriors to wear red robes and grow long braids. Although they changed their attire during this battle, the long braids have not been lost." Printors explained at the side.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax nodded suddenly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "5,417 prisoners were also captured, 2,900 of whom had injuries ranging from mild to severe." Muklu looked at the statistics board and continued: "921 of the prisoners were Spartans, and more than 300 blacks. Roshi..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "In other words, the Spartans lost nearly 1,500 soldiers, which is a large number. It will be much easier for us to attack the Spartan territory next." Printors Having said that, he did not relax his brows, but said seriously: "Tell us about our losses."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Uh..." Muklu looked at the wooden board and said softly: "...Uh, we have killed a total of 1,560 soldiers and nearly 1,500 were injured. Now the medical staff are conducting emergency rescue-" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It's so big Casualties?!" Crotokatax exclaimed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The casualties mainly came from the First Legion. In the process of chasing the 'broken troops', they were attacked from the front and back by Spartan warriors and Tegea soldiers -" Muklu was explaining, and was interrupted by Clotokatak Si suddenly interrupted: "How is my brother...the third captain of the First Legion, Adoris...? Are you okay?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After learning that the First Legion was facing real Spartans, and suffered another During the flanking attack, Clotokatax had been worried about the safety of Adoris, but he kept in mind his father's warning: "You can't be selfish on the battlefield." Therefore, he could only suppress this worry temporarily. Deep in his heart, now that he knew that the First Legion had suffered heavy casualties, he finally couldn't help but ask.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Highness..." Muklu did not dare to remove Crotokatax's concerned gaze. Instead, he turned to look at Printors and whispered with great difficulty: "...Captain Adoris's heroic battle Dead..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as the words came out, Clotoka Taxun felt dizzy, and his whole body fell down from the horse.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Highness!" Printors, who was prepared, hurriedly supported him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Where is my brother?! I want to go see him!" Clotokatax pushed Printors away and said urgently, with a cry in his voice.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotokatax staggered past the rows of neatly arranged remains of Theonian soldiers, feeling The time was extremely long, and he asked eagerly more than once: "Why haven't you arrived yet?! Why haven't you arrived yet?!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Finally, the First Army officer leading the way stopped and said in a heavy tone: "This is the body of Captain Adoris..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax was shocked and looked intently: a body was lying not far away. What was different was that it was covered with a white cloth. Adoris's face was not visible, but Ctissus and several other officers of the First Legion were standing next to the corpse.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax ignored the salutes of Ctissus and others. He walked over with heavy steps, slowly squatted down, and with trembling fingers, he was about to lift the white cloth.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Highness, Adoris was severely injured and his face was severely damaged... You'd better not look at it..." Ctissus on the side discouraged him in a low voice.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotokatax's heart trembled, but he lifted the white cloth more firmly, only to see Adoris' broken breastplate, multiple blood marks from spear stabs, and a blood hole as big as an egg in the center of his face. It was beyond recognition and extremely terrifying...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Ah!" Clotokatax couldn't help but scream when he suddenly saw it, and immediately closed his eyes in pain, but he quickly opened it again, holding his hands without hesitation. caressing the face of the deceased.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
