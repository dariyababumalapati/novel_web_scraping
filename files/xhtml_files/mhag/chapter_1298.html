   Chapter 1298 Karia's Resistance&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, Capos whispered to him: "Are you going to lead the army to march eastward along the coast?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, because this can ensure the safety and security of the logistics transportation line. Conveniently, it reduces the threat from the Persians to the coalition's flanks, and also ensures that the army can conquer Asia Minor at a faster speed." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Uh... While I was returning to Thurii from the Po River area and waiting to set off, Princess Christoya She once summoned me, and she asked me to bring you a message, hoping that you can conquer or surrender Miletus as soon as possible."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Miletus?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You don't know?" Capus saw that Leoticides was a little confused, He reminded: "Princess Christoya is from Miletus, but since she followed His Majesty, she has not been able to return to Miletus for decades. I heard that this time His Majesty promised the princess that after Miletus surrendered to the Kingdom, she would be allowed to return to her hometown. , to visit relatives."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Upon hearing this, Leoticides stopped and fell into deep thought.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Capps did not urge him to move forward. He also stopped and looked at the Sades City Gate standing directly in front of him. Even though he had experienced countless storms and waves, he couldn't help but feel a little agitated at this moment: More than 30 years ago, in May, He had been here before under the leadership of Nong, but the Saders strictly prohibited them from entering the city, and also designated a small area five miles away so that the mercenaries could only build camps in this area. He was not allowed to move around and guarded them like thieves... But today, not only could he enter the city with great pride, but he would also become the master of this land and its people!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   With Cappus leading the administrators to run the conquest's rear, Leoticides could devote all his energy to Military.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the end of June, the coalition forces marched eastward to the coast of Ephesus. A riot broke out among the people of the city. They overthrew the pro-Persian oligarchic group and left the city for more than 10 miles to welcome the arrival of the Greek coalition forces.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In mid-July, the Greek coalition forces arrived at Miletus, and the Miletus oligarchic government sent an envoy to meet Leoticides, claiming that Miletus would remain neutral and not participate in the war between Theonia and Persia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leotychides refused without hesitation and strongly demanded that Miletus must surrender unconditionally.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While the oligarchic government of Miletus was arguing about this, the Greek coalition forces surrounded the entire city, and the Theonian Fourth Fleet subsequently arrived to block the port, causing the people of Miletus to panic.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, personnel from the Theonian Intelligence Department lurking in the city of Miletus began to spread rumors. People were surprised to learn that in the Holy Kingdom of Theonia there was a Christo who was deeply loved by the King of Theonia. Princess Ya, she is a Milesian. She has always been looking forward to returning to her hometown. Today's Milesian oligarchic government actually understands this situation, but the reason why they refuse to surrender is because most of them persecuted Christo. The culprits of the Theonian family, as long as they are captured, dedicated to the Theonian army, and surrendered to the Theonian army, Princess Christoya will definitely protect them out of gratitude to them and nostalgia for her hometown. The city was not affected by the war...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This rumor was very convincing, and the people were skeptical. Some people specifically investigated the people and things mentioned in the rumor, and found that it was true, which immediately caused a big stir among the people. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As a result, people who were dissatisfied with the Milesian oligarchy began to work together to incite the people to overthrow them and submit to Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Miletus government felt that the situation was not good and was preparing to send troops to suppress it. Who knew that the Theonian army outside the city launched an attack at this time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the walls of Miletus are tall and strong, the strength of Miletus alone is obviously insufficient to defend the entire city, not to mention that it has been completely surrounded and there is no possibility of any reinforcements. Therefore, under the control of the Theonian army, The oligarchic group was unable to mobilize more troops to suppress the instability in the city, but the patrols they sent to arrest and arrest in the city quickly aroused the anger of the people. In the end, the people launched a riot and assisted the Theonian army to easily The city of Miletus was captured, which resulted in very few casualties on both sides, thereby achieving Leoticides's goal of giving a good explanation to Princess Christoya, who was respected by the people of Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the surrender of Miletus, the Greek coalition forces never encountered any battle again. The journey was smooth, and all the towns they passed opened their cities and surrendered, until they arrived at Halicarnassus, the capital of Caria.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The coastal city-states in Caria, like most coastal city-states in western Asia Minor, were once colonial cities established by the Greeks. Not only did they maintain close ties with the native Greek city-states, they also gradually civilized and integrated Caria over hundreds of years. The indigenous people of Rhea. Not only did most of the towns in the area look exactly like the native Greek cities, but Greek also became the common language in the area. Although Caria was eventually conquered by the Persian Empire and became one of its provinces, the The region remained relatively independent like other regions in western Asia Minor, and even most of the towns in the region were united around a confederation of neighbors centered on the temple of Zeus in Lagina, although it was of course only a religious group, not a a political entity.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Agesilaus led the army to stir up chaos in western Asia Minor, and Tissaphoris was executed by the Queen Mother of Persia for his crime, the Carian nobleman Hecatomnus took advantage of the turbulent situation to attack Carre. Established rule in the sub-region.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, because the Persian king not only negotiated peace with Sparta, but also supported Sparta's hegemony in Greece, this caused great dissatisfaction among the nobles and people in western Asia Minor. In order to appease them, Artaxerxes married one of his daughters to While giving the son of Pharnabazus, Hecatomnus was also temporarily appointed governor of Caria.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hekatomnus was a very shrewd man, as was his son Mausolus. They had always paid tribute to the Persian treasury on time and expressed their submission to the Persian king.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Five years ago, when almost all the governors in western Asia Minor rebelled, Mausolus, who succeeded his father as governor of Caria, also wavered. He first remained neutral, and then turned to the rebels when they were at a disadvantage. King of Persia, and assisted the Persian army to completely suppress the rebellion, so after the war, his governorship was retained.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During this turbulent period, his power in Caria was further strengthened. He was not only the officially appointed governor of Caria by Persia, but also the co-tyrant of many cities in the Caria region.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition, Mausolus also moved the governor's residence from Mirasa to Halicarnassus. Not only did he spend a huge amount of money to rebuild the city of Halicarnassus, but he also expanded the port. On the small island Zephili outside the city Ang built a strong castle and two military ports, and spent a lot of money to build a fleet. He was ambitious and obviously wanted to develop Caria into a maritime power.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Worried that the landing of the Greek coalition forces would interrupt his ongoing plan, this time he actively supported Pharnabazus, not only providing a large number of troops, but also becoming one of the main advocates of forming an Asia Minor fleet, 1/4 The number of warships was generously provided by him. Of course, he was also planning how to control the command of the Asia Minor fleet in his own hands after the war.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Unfortunately, the Asia Minor fleet was completely annihilated by the Theonian fleet in Samos, giving him a heavy blow. Then the Greek coalition defeated the Persian army, which made him feel extremely uneasy. He immediately carried out operations in the Caria area. Military mobilization strengthened the defense of Halicarnassus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   His prediction was correct. Next, the Greek coalition forces marched eastward along the coast with overwhelming force and entered the Caria region.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mausolus immediately repeated his old trick and sent an envoy to meet Leoticides and proposed to him that Caria was willing to remain neutral in this war, and was even willing to provide some property to the Greek coalition forces to pass through. Provides some conveniences in the Caria region, as long as the Greek coalition no longer regards Caria as an enemy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mausolus's idea is very good, but Leoticides has learned some information about Caria in detail, and he is not confident about the cunning and changeable Mausolus, and the strength of Caria is not weak, he He was not worried about leaving such a hidden danger behind and placing it in the rear of the army, so he did not accept Mausolus's request, but instead proposed: The Caria region must surrender to Theonia!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, this was unacceptable to the ambitious Mausolus, so the negotiations failed and war began.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mausolus knew that the morale of the Greek coalition was high and its strength was strong, and a field battle with it would only lead to a disastrous defeat. Therefore, he reduced his troops to the city and defended with all his strength to delay time and wait for the battle situation to change.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hekatomnus and Mausolus, the father and son, have been running the Caria region for more than 20 years. The opposition has been suppressed for a long time and has little influence. The people basically agree with the rule of this family, so it cannot be like Ephesus. Like So and Miletus, turmoil and riots occurred when the army pressed on the border, so the Greek coalition had no other means except a hard attack.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, under the city of Halicarnassus, which has thick walls and tight defenses, several strong attacks by the Greek coalition failed. As a result, the arrogance of the Greek coalition generals due to the previous smooth offensive situation was swept away. Kong, had to patiently start a fierce battle with Mosolas.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;

  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the end of April, Davos led the army from Dafinay to the east. The huge fleet of baggage ships sailed parallel along the coast and passed by The 6-day trek crossed the desert, bypassed Gaza City, and entered the Canaan region.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then the port of Jaffa was easily captured, making it an important supply port for the army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
