   Chapter 1200: Rebuilding Sparta (3)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   With Clotokatax's guarantee, everyone felt a little calmer, and they were eager to leave, so they temporarily put this somewhat troublesome issue behind them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotokatax specifically asked his men to prepare rations for them and prepare horses. His warm-hearted performance completely dispelled their doubts.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After sending these people away, Crotokatax breathed a sigh of relief, but he quickly picked up his spirits and walked to a room next to the venue.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even if the helots were cowardly and clumsy, Clotokatax would not agree to the original suggestion of the Pilians to exclude the helots from the new government management. Without the helots' support, Containment, the Piliasians may become the new Spartans in a few years.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, he will not let the Spartans be marginalized in this new government. On the one hand, with the existence of the Spartans, Theonia can confidently face the doubts and justifications of those Greek city-states who are concerned about Sparta. Said "They did not destroy this ancient city-state, but just changed its political system, just like Sparta did to other city-states when it was strong"; on the other hand, let the Spartans, who are now the weakest, join Entering the new political system may make the political situation of New Sparta more stable and more conducive to Theonia's control of Sparta.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Clotokatax returned the military salute to the Theonian soldiers guarding the door, he gently opened the ajar wooden door.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There were 30 Spartan elders headed by Agesilaus and 5 inspectors in the room. It seemed a bit crowded, but the assassin was unusually quiet.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This was a bit unexpected by Clotokatax. His eyes slowly swept across everyone's face, and finally showed a smile, because although these Spartans acted calmly, they could not hide it. The anger in their eyes: "Everyone, I believe you have all heard what I just said in the venue, and I'm afraid it has been discussed. Now can you tell me your decision?" As soon as the words fell&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   , a younger man The censor couldn't help but roared: "You are humiliating the Spartans! As descendants of Hercules, we will never fight with the dirty and lowly helots-" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Cough! Cough! Cough. !..." Agesilaus suddenly coughed loudly, turned his head, and looked at the inspector coldly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The inspector's roar stopped abruptly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus coughed a few times again, then looked at Crotocathax, and said calmly: "We Spartans have become your prisoners, and there are no more choices. We can only obey your arrangements... But I want to know, how can we Spartans cooperate with the Piliasians and those... helots to form a new Spartan government? "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Klotokatax did not respond directly, but looked at the roaring Spartan just now, and asked again: "Are you really willing to accept our arrangement?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The man glanced at Agesilaus , lowered his head, gritted his teeth and squeezed out: "...willing."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "If we don't do this, do we have more choices?!" Agesilaus then said loudly: "We Spartans If you accept the fate of the helots, you might as well choose death!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   His words were not so much a reply to Clotokatax as a reminder to these Spartans, who all remained dejected and silent. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It seems that you have reached a consensus, which is good!" Clotokatax deliberately said loudly, and the unwillingness and pain in their eyes made him feel a little happy: "You Spartans must also fight within 4 days. Elect 10 deputies and two censors, and form the new government of Sparta together with the candidates selected by the Piliasians and Helots!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "30 deputies, 6 censors..." Ah With a tentative look in his eyes, Geselaus deliberately whispered: "It sounds not much different from the Spartans of the past."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "No, there is a difference." Clotokatax answered simply: "They are just Responsible for the operation of the entire government, the designation and promulgation of laws and major decisions must be discussed and approved by the Citizens' Assembly, and all citizens of New Sparta have the right to participate in this assembly." Having said&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   this, Clotokatax also I specifically mentioned: "Of course, there was a citizens' assembly in Sparta in the past, and it was indeed somewhat similar."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Everyone's expressions changed slightly: Sparta's citizens' assembly has always been a guise, and the real highest power lies in the Council of Elders, and Dai The new government established by the Onians completely changed the power structure of Sparta.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Some elders couldn't help but asked: "What about the king?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax said loudly: "The new Sparta will no longer have a king, and will elect two consuls for a one-year term. Responsible for commanding the army in battle."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Everyone subconsciously turned their attention to Agesilaus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus seemed very calm, as if the matter had nothing to do with him, and asked: "When will you lift the captivity of the Spartan people?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the new Spartan government is established."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "We How can we conduct an election when all the people are locked up?!" someone protested.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Tomorrow, all Spartan adult men will be gathered at the Port of Hilles for election." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I have another question." Agesilaus looked at him and asked seriously: "I just heard you You said, you want to allocate land to the Pileas and Helots, which means you want them to take away the land that originally belonged to our Spartan citizens?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Please note that Theonia has been occupied. All of you have become prisoners of Sparta, and the land of Lagnia has become a spoil of war for the Theonian army! In order to rebuild Sparta, His Majesty King Davos generously distributed these lands to those who are willing to do so. Citizens who serve this new government.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   To put it bluntly, even if these lands are still owned by you, the Pilians and Helots have been freed and no longer have any obligations to you. It's up to you. That little manpower can't take care of so much land. What's more -" Clotokatax raised his eyebrows and showed a sarcastic smile: "Do you Spartans know how to farm?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Everyone looked a little ugly. , but couldn't refute it for a while.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The guards around Crotokatax increased their vigilance, but he continued as if he had not seen him: "In the past few days, I have carefully checked some of your Spartan information and discovered a problem. Your Spartan The number of citizens in Tajikistan is decreasing year by year, and the war is not the main reason. According to the data, many people have not only lost the right to participate in public meals because they have been unable to pay a sufficient share of the oral tax for a long time, and have been reduced to inferiors, they have also been Deprived of the land... I originally thought it might be because of the perennial wars. Even though the black laborers helped them cultivate the land, they did not have enough time to supervise and manage it, resulting in the harvest of the fields never meeting your requirements.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But strangely The nobles of Sparta were able to pay their taxes in full every year. Later, someone secretly told me that this was because they often served as commanders of some city-states and strategic locations controlled by Sparta. Obtain a large amount of money by taking bribes or other means, and it is more than enough to buy food and pay taxes...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I also discovered a problem. The land you collected from Spartan civilians was eventually distributed to royal members and nobles. The reason It is they who have the ability to ensure better field harvests. As a result, the land is gradually concentrated in the hands of your nobles, while more and more Spartan civilians are losing their land and becoming inferior people... Haven't you noticed? Now Sparta How come the situation is very similar to the rumored situation before the Spartan sage came to Cugu to change the political system!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You are talking nonsense!" someone yelled.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax looked at him, not angry at all, but said pitifully: "Are you a censor? Whether as a civilian or as a censor, you have not noticed that the greedy nobles are embezzling the common people's shares. Earth, this is your dereliction of duty! You should also thank Theonia. If we didn't forcibly rebuild Sparta, there would be one Kina Dun after another on this land!" The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   faces of everyone in the room became ugly. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus coughed lightly and immediately changed the subject: "How much land are you going to allocate to each new citizen of Sparta?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "About five acres."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "There are too many Helots, so I'm afraid it won't be enough. "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Klotokatax said calmly: "We gave the territory of Tegia to the Mandinians, but the population of Mandinia is not large and cannot handle such a vast and fertile new addition. Land. With our persuasion, I believe they are willing to accept these helots who failed to get land in Sparta as new citizens of Mandinia."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus was stunned: "Those Tegeans What?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "They are all being taken to the Turiyi slave market for sale. This is the result of betraying the alliance and secretly attacking their allies." Clotokatax said in a cold tone.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Everyone suddenly felt cold in their hearts, and at that moment they did not dare to make eye contact with this young man.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing this scene, Clotokatax suddenly felt a little bored. No matter how much he frightened the Spartans, he could not get his brother Adoris' precious life back. He said indifferently: "Okay. Everyone, I hope you will organize your citizens after you go back today and lead them to safely arrive at Port Hilles tomorrow to ensure the smooth progress of the election."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax left, and there was silence in the room.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a long time, someone asked uneasily: "King Agesilaus, what should we do now?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus still looked calm. He whispered: "We can only endure it temporarily to avoid suffering Tiger's attack." The fate of the subhumans. However, the wanton behavior of the Theonians will definitely force Athens and Corinth to unite and become enemies of Theonia. Then our opportunity will come!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
