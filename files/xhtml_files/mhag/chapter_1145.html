   Chapter 1145 Half an hour after landing in Messenia&#13;

   , the Theonian soldiers saw the city on the coast and said it was an important town. In fact, it was just a small stone city with a small area, stuck between the mountains and On the narrow land between the coasts, a row of warriors wearing red cloaks stood on the top of the city. The spears in their hands reflected the sunlight. From a distance, it was not clear whether their faces were fearful or excited. They remained motionless. Standing, such a gesture seemed to be a stimulus to the legionnaires of Theonia, causing their fighting spirit to soar rapidly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Quiet down, everyone! We will land on Messenia Beach soon. You have plenty of opportunities to fight the Spartans!" Max loudly scolded the excited soldiers on the troop carrier: "But now you all give me Stay quietly and conserve your strength. When the ship docks, be the first to rush aboard!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Don't worry, squad leader! We will never fall behind other squads, and we will definitely be the first to rush forward!" One person breaks through the enemy's defense line!" a soldier said loudly, which immediately received a positive response from other soldiers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I hope so." Max replied seemingly nonchalantly, but he felt excited inside because his morale was available.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He held the side of the ship with one hand and looked down at the blue water. He couldn't help but recall the embarrassing appearance when he landed at Trina Naval Base in a warship for the first time. But then he followed the army to land in Sicily and defeated 100,000 Carthage soldiers. The army then landed in Africa and conquered Carthage, having already overcome seasickness.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the Western Mediterranean War, Max and some Roman aristocratic soldiers were arranged to live in the Thurii region. He was fortunate enough to be incorporated into the First Legion. Later, he went north to conquer Gaul and was promoted to squad leader due to his military exploits, thus crossing the border. Joined the ranks of Theonia officers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even more fortunately, he adapted to life in Theonia and was unwilling to associate with those former Roman nobles who were still resentful of the kingdom. As a result, many Roman nobles were killed in the rebellion in Thuri a few years ago. was arrested, but he was not implicated and was not even questioned or examined once. His superiors played a big role in this.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Adoris is his immediate boss, the captain of the Third Battalion of the First Legion. Max has gone round and round and returned to his command again. It is really fate. Adoris does take good care of him...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Max is still thinking about it. These past events and the cheers of the soldiers on the ship brought him back to reality: "We have crossed the cape, the fleet has turned around, we are almost there!!..." The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   southern coastline of the Peloponnese Peninsula is shaped like an "M" It forms two bays, the Gulf of Laconia to the east and the Gulf of Messenia to the west. When the fleet rounded the promontory formed by mountains, the first division of the First Fleet sailing at the forefront The fleet warships were divided into two parts. A small number of warships turned around to the north and approached the beach in front, while most of the warships turned around to the south and began to form a ship formation on the east side of the bay to guard against possible harassment by enemy ships. Ensure the safety of landing ships.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Countless troop carriers gradually expanded as they traveled north, spreading out on the sea surface of the entire bay. Coupled with the baggage ships following the troop carriers, the entire bay was almost filled with ships.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The ship Max was riding was at the forefront. He looked ahead. As the ship moved forward, the scene in his eyes became clearer: on both sides were the outlines of lush mountains, in the center were flat and wide plains and white sandy beaches, with a white line in the middle leading from the south. Divide it in two to the north... There are no seaside towns built in such an excellent bay. There are only sparse villages, simple docks, and few ships. However, there are flocks of seagulls in the sky, flying up and down and chirping. There are quite a few Very interesting...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He was used to seeing the prosperity and bustle of Turiyi Port. When he saw this barely developed bay, Max's eyes lit up.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But this mood soon passed, because some Spartan soldiers appeared on the beach.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Spartans went through three wars in the process of conquering Messenia, especially in the first two wars, Messenian soldiers relied on fortresses and towns, stubbornly resisted the Spartan attack, which made the war last for a long time and caused a lot of trouble to the Spartans, so after completely conquering Messenia, the Spartans demolished the plain There are only villages and no towns on this plain, which is the largest plain compared to other areas of the Peloponnese Peninsula.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But there is a larger military camp in the center of the plain, which is where the Spartans train warriors and a base where they can form an army at any time to suppress the Helot rebellion.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During the war with Thebes, due to Athens' participation in the war, the strength of the Athens navy posed a threat to the sea areas controlled by Sparta. In order to ensure the security of Messenia, Sparta also sent additional troops to Messenia. Some warriors, but after the signing of the Callias Contract, Sparta immediately withdrew its excess citizens, and now there are less than 500 Spartan warriors left in the entire Messenia region.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, the Spartans firmly believed that even with such a small garrison, Messenia would remain stable because of decades of brutal rule and year after year of bloody killings (that is, Sparta would allow young warriors to Kill any helots you see at a fixed time. On the one hand, it allows young people to see blood and exercise their courage; on the other hand, it prevents the overpopulation of helots.) The helots have already become like cattle and sheep. Tame, and even when foreign enemies invade, they can organize helots to serve as auxiliaries, expand the size of the army, and resist.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The current situation is like this. The Spartan patrol ship hurriedly withdrew to Messenia and reported to the military camp: A huge fleet of Theonia appeared offshore, and it was menacing. I am afraid it has bad intentions.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The commander of the military camp, Dolios, experienced brutal Agego military training since he was a child and became one of the best warriors. Therefore, he was selected into the King's Guard as an adult and fought dozens of times in his 20-year military career. , has made many military exploits and has rich military experience. He was appointed as the military governor of Messenia the year before last and was responsible for the defense of the region.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After hearing the news, Dolios immediately aroused vigilance. Not only did he quickly gather the soldiers in the military camp, but he also sent people to notify the Sheriffs of each village (these Sheriffs were old and frail former Spartans who had retired from the army). Warriors, they were appointed to manage various villages in Messenia. They had three main tasks: to supervise the work of the helots and prevent them from being lazy, to collect most of the harvest after the autumn harvest, and to supervise the daily life of the helots and detect any abnormalities. Immediately notify the military camp for hunting) and ask them to organize all the young and strong helots.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The envoys sent by the Spartan military camp took a small boat to meet the Theonian warship entering the bay, preparing to question why it suddenly invaded Spartan territory without prior notice.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, the envoy failed to board the Theonian warship at all. The boat was knocked over, and the hostility of the Theonian people was fully revealed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After receiving the news, Dolios immediately led the Spartan warriors to the seaside, and at the same time ordered the sheriffs of each village to arrive as soon as possible with the Helot teams.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hurrying to the beach, Dolios took a closer look and couldn't help but be dumbfounded: all the ships in his field of vision were Theonian ships, boundless...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This overwhelming momentum made Dolios, who had experienced hundreds of battles, couldn't help but feel nervous. numb.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Messenia region ruled by Sparta was not without invasions for decades. During the Peloponnesian War, the Athenian fleet attacked here many times, but the number of soldiers who landed was not large. Most of the time, Before the Spartan reinforcements arrived, they hurriedly fled by boat. Even once they launched an attack on the camp, they were defeated by Spartan warriors who had fewer soldiers than themselves... The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Athenian army at that time was on land. Rarely did he fight the Spartans head-on. This was the first time Dolios encountered such a large-scale landing battle like today. Fortunately, the Helot troops arrived one after another, and the number of the entire army gradually increased to 3,000. Even though most of the Helots only held a spear, let alone armor, and did not even have a shield, it made Dolios feel relieved.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But then he frowned again, because he saw that the ships on the sea were spread out so widely, and it seemed that they were preparing for a full-scale landing: the coast that could be landed was more than twenty miles, and he only had such a small force in his hand, how could it be possible? Complete defense!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What's more, the number of Helots in this team is several times that of Spartan warriors. Once they are let out of the control of Spartan warriors and go on defense alone, it will be difficult to guarantee their loyalty.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And if the Spartan warriors are dispersed into various Helot teams, it will greatly weaken the combat effectiveness of the entire army, especially in the face of the Diorian army, which is rumored to be not weak in combat effectiveness...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Dorios dare not Taking this risk, he decided not to disperse his army and first concentrate on defending the beach west of the mouth of the Parmisus River.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The number of Spartan soldiers seems to be quite large!" At this time, he had followed Leoticides from the flagship of the First Fleet to another battleship. Tisias on the boat said loudly. The warship he was on was less than two miles from the coast, so he could see relatively clearly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Many of them are helots, and they will not fight with all their strength for the Spartans!" Ionicus put his hand on his forehead, looked ahead, and reminded loudly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Muklu, the staff officer on the side, pointed to the coast in front and reminded the army commander: "Sir, the Spartans are concentrated together and do not disperse their defenses."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides looked at the coast attentively, and the battle was about to begin. The battle suppressed his slightly fluctuating emotions before, and he said calmly: "Inform the warships to attack! Let the soldiers prepare for landing!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
