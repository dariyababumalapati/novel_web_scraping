   Chapter 1215 Cruel&#13;

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Polyfulon These words of Agurrios made the other generals think.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "But even if we don't tell the Greek coalition the news, Thessaly will send a messenger to the Peloponnese to tell the tyrant, and the Phocians in the north will also..." Someone raised an objection.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I think Agullios's suggestion is very reasonable." Cabulias first expressed his approval: "We can first send a messenger to quietly inform Iphicrates and ask him to urge the Greek coalition forces to seize the time to increase the number of troops. Attack on Messenia and Sparta. As for the messengers sent by Thessaly, whether by sea or land, they will inevitably pass through the sphere of influence under our control. We only need to strengthen the patrol of Saron Bay and the isthmus. , The Thessaly messenger cannot escape from our hands, we only need-" Cabrias stretched out his right hand and made a slashing gesture, which everyone understood.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "As for the Phokis, they are more afraid of the Thessalians than Theonia. We only need to send troops to support them, and they will agree with our approach." After&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Cabrias finished speaking, there was silence for a moment. Someone soon said: "I think Cabrias's suggestion is feasible. Even if the tyrant will eventually get the news, we have won time. Maybe during this time, we have recaptured Sparta. "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I agree too."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Athenian generals all agreed. Only Callistratus was still hesitant, but the situation was decided.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   His father Agurrios once again calmly closed his eyes to rest.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the army set off by ship this morning, Clotocathus, Printoles and others garrisoned the Peloponnese Sa's generals had been thinking about the important event of "whether the landing in Thessaly would be successful." They waited until late at night when the fleet returned one after another, and then they got the exact news, and they could finally celebrate the successful landing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But this is just the beginning, because starting from tomorrow, whether it is Thessaly, Central Greece, or even the city-states of Peloponnese, they may know the news of the "Theonian army raiding Thessaly", and they will inevitably Corresponding measures will be taken, and Theonia cannot often send such a large fleet to Thessaly to transport supplies. After all, the ship owner and crew are not soldiers and should not take such a big risk.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The nearly 100,000 troops in the Peloponnese consume a huge amount of military supplies every day. They must occupy Thessaly as soon as possible in order to obtain all the supplies in Thessaly to support the army's continued operations. Therefore, the next few days will be difficult for both sides. is the key.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Polyfulon killed his second brother Polydorus, he immediately let the henchmen under his command surround the central army. The big account, on the grounds that "Polydorus was assassinated by the Theonians and the guards were derelict in their duties", all the soldiers of Polydorus's guards were arrested, and then notified the generals of the army to come to the big account urgently to discuss matters.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before dawn, the Thessalian generals gathered in the big tent and were shocked to learn that "Polydorus was assassinated by the Theonians". At the same time, they were inevitably doubtful.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But Polyfulon did not give them more time to think, nor did he listen to their dissuasion. He directly announced that all the Guards soldiers who had "neglected their duties" would be pulled outside the tent and beheaded in public.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In an instant, the camp was filled with heads and screams.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This sight frightened the generals in the big tent. Faced with Polyfulon's loyal troops who were sharpening their swords, they quickly recognized that Polyfulon would succeed Polydorus and become the temporary military governor of Thessaly. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After taking control of the camp, Polyfulon first imposed a complete blockade on the camp, prohibiting anyone from going out, and then sent a messenger to the city of Philae. In the name of Polydorus, he falsely claimed that "there is an important mission." Military matters need to be discussed with the left-behind minister Asidamas and others, hoping they can come to the camp."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Archidamas was worried about "the sudden landing of the Theonian army in Thessaly" and stayed awake all night. After listening to the Polyfulon messenger, he thought that the battle situation in Thessaly had changed again. , in his eagerness, without thinking about it, he hurried to the military camp outside the city with several other ministers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As a result, as soon as he entered the military camp, he was arrested by soldiers sent by Polyfulon.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Immediately afterwards, Polyfulon sentenced Asidamas and others to death on the charge of "colluding with the Theonian army and intending to rebel."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The generals tried their best to dissuade him, but Polyfulon refused to listen and forcibly executed Asidamas and six others.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the soldiers brought the heads of the six men into the tent, Polyfulon pointed at the head of Asidamas and cursed. It turned out that he thought that Asidamas had always looked down on him, and Jason never gave him important tasks alone. , it was Archidamas and others who caused trouble.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, murder is only one of Polyfuron's purposes. More importantly, he believes that Asidamas and others hold the administrative power of the Thessaly city-state alliance. With their existence, he wants to be free in this land. Actions are bound to be hindered.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, it was just dawn, and Polyfulon quickly gathered his army and entered the city of Philae.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At first, the people of Philae were excited because with the army stationed, their safety would be more guaranteed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Unexpectedly, after Polyfulon summoned the officials of Philae, he asked them to carry out military mobilization in the city, gather all the citizen soldiers, and follow his army to repel the Theonian army entrenched near Larissa. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the officials heard this, they immediately refused on the grounds that "we only obey the orders of Lord Asidamas".&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Polyfulon immediately raised the head of Asidamas, and also executed the two officials who opposed the most fiercely on the spot for "colluding with the Theonians with the intention of rebellion."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The ferocious power of Polyfulon frightened the officials of Philae, and they could only obey the instructions with trepidation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Jason had previously carried out military mobilization across Thessaly and recruited an army to go south to fight. The more the better in other city-states, but he only recruited less than 1,000 soldiers for the city of Philae because the city of Philae, where he made his fortune, needed He had enough power to serve as the mainstay to stabilize the situation in Thessaly after he led his army to leave.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the city of Philae was originally in a state of war readiness, more than 6,000 citizen soldiers were summoned in just half a day. Counting the 2,000 soldiers originally stationed in Philae, the number of soldiers in Polyfulon was close to 30,000 people.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He thought he had strong military strength. Even though he had received the report of the reconnaissance cavalry at this time, "The Theonian army captured the city of Larissa", he still confidently believed that he could lead his army to repel the Theonian army, so He ignored the dissuasion of Philae officials and soon led his army out of the city and marched towards Larissa.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Also in the early morning of this day, Patroclus summoned Effialt, the commander of the Eleventh Legion, and gave him an order: The Eleventh Legion Guard Lamia and Heraclea, capture Thermopylae as soon as possible, and at the same time block the Thessalian reinforcements coming from the south.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Accepting this order meant that the Eleventh Legion could no longer participate in the military operation to conquer Thessaly. After a moment of hesitation, Efialt accepted the order, but at the same time he also made a request: If a fighter plane is discovered, the Eleventh Legion Is it possible to continue southward and attack Greek towns?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In view of the fact that Effialt was also a veteran general who was experienced in the battlefield and used his troops prudently, Patroclus agreed to his request, but at the same time emphasized that no matter what kind of military action he took, he must first ensure that Lamia and Hercules The safety of Asia and Thermopylae.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Effialt accepted the order, he immediately began to prepare for the military operation to capture Thermopylae. Although according to the confession of the Thessalian soldiers captured in Heraclea, Thermopylae was only garrisoned by more than 200 mercenaries, but its dangerous terrain The terrain and the legendary story still made Ephialt adopt a cautious attitude. He left 2,000 soldiers to garrison Lamia and 1,000 soldiers to garrison Heraclea. He personally led 5,000 soldiers and engineering battalions, and also brought Got several Lamian guides.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although that legendary story showed the world the difficulty of capturing Hot Spring Pass, it also told the world that "there are remote mountain roads that can go around to the south of Hot Spring Pass." Therefore, Efialt decided to use "the main force to contain it from the front and send strange soldiers." To seize Thermopylae by "taking a roundabout way through the mountains", he removed the Samnite soldiers from the light armored brigade and the light infantry brigade to form a surprise force (the Eleventh Legion's military camp was in Lucenia, and the soldiers came from the Dauni area, In recent years, many Samoni people have taken the initiative to come out of the mountains and voluntarily applied to become Theonian citizens. Most of their residences are in the eastern plains of Campania and the Daoni region). They will be in Lamia Under the leadership of the guide, he used his excellent mountain combat capabilities to complete a circuitous raid on Hot Spring Pass.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While the Eleventh Legion was preparing to take military action against Thermopylae, Patroclus had led other legions to begin crossing the mountains north of Lamia in order to enter the southern plains of Thessaly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In order to prevent being intercepted by the Thessalian army in the mountains, he divided his army into three parts, led by Lamia guides, and advanced into Thessally's territory through three routes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Also on the morning of this day, Hilos brought a large group of middle and low-level officials from various departments of the kingdom (these officials were all responsible for the administration of the kingdom). They were carefully selected by the government and ordered to govern the Thessaly area that was about to be conquered. More than half of them were originally refugees from Thessaly) and came to Larissa.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Note: According to historical records, the first thing Polyfulon did after taking over Tagus was to arrest and execute the auxiliary Jason and the governor of Thessaly, headed by Asidamas, without any reason. The eight best administrative ministers also exiled many officials, and then ruled Thessaly in a brutal way, which caused great dissatisfaction among the people of Thessaly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Within a year, his general Alexander rebelled under the banner of "avenging Polydorus", killed him, and then became the new Tagus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But this Alexander was also a tyrant. Under his rule, Thessaly's national power declined and eventually fell into turmoil, and was later conquered by the rising Macedon.&#13;
