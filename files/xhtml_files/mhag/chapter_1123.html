   Chapter 1123 Theonia's Counterattack Plan (continued)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sipulos also said: "Your Majesty, we are sending a large army into the Po River plain to engage in fierce battles in the territory of the Gauls. This will inevitably cause the Ligurians and Due to the uneasiness of the Veneti people, in order to avoid some accidents, while sending troops, we can also send envoys to these two races. Tell them that the Kingdom of Theonia was invaded by the Gauls, so Then we sent troops to fight back and invited them to attack the Gauls' territory together. Even if they refuse to join, it will weaken their uneasiness about our sudden appearance in the Po River plain..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos nodded, feeling justified.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty." At this time, Sedorum asked: "After our army conquers the Gauls, what should we do with them?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sedorum's question made Davos fall into deep thought, because He had no prior plan to attack Alpine Gaul at this stage, and naturally he had not drawn up a detailed plan to resettle the surrendered Gauls after the war. What came to his mind was Caesar's war against Alpine Gaul in his previous life. During the eight-year long campaign, they bloodyly conquered the indigenous peoples on the land north of the Alps and up to the island of England. They paid a high price in the continuous battles and killed countless Gauls. Finally, In exchange for their surrender.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As for the Alpine Gaul, it seems that after Rome became stronger, they submitted and no major war occurred. Of course, when Hannibal led his army to cross the Alps and attack Rome, these Alpine Gauls joined in one after another. His subordinates resisted the Romans...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked at Alexis and Printors, with a cold light in his eyes, and said in a strong tone: "The Gauls are a fierce race, and we don't want to fight against them. If there is any mercy, as long as they are still resisting, the fighting and killing of the soldiers will not stop. Only if we are more ferocious than them will they be afraid and surrender! If there are any&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Gallic tribes that want to surrender, you can tell them , 'It is okay to surrender, but you must unconditionally accept our resettlement of their territory, and you must also abide by some resolutions made by the kingdom for the surrendered Gauls.'...These resolutions...wait for me to have special discussions with you. After that, it will be submitted to the Senate for approval...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But regardless of whether the Gauls surrender or not, some important towns in the Gallic territory must be captured and firmly in our hands, such as Arimium, we captured it. Only by providing military supplies and supplies can the army be transported more quickly and smoothly. There is also Boroma, the central town of the Senones. Only when our army crosses the mountains from Etrunia and enters the Po River plain can it be guaranteed; and Mediolan, the central town of the Sarvis people, only by occupying it can we prevent more Gauls from crossing the Alps and entering the Po River plain..." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Understood, Your Majesty." Sedoulu Mu, Alexis and Printors responded one after another.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, although the Gauls have suffered heavy losses, it is easier for the Gauls to defend themselves by launching an attack only from the sea. It is better to wait for the army to attack Alimium and attract the main force of the Gauls, so that the troops originally in Etruria can The troops led by Patroclus and Hasdrubal in the territory also launched an attack on the Gallic territory... If you are worried about the difficulty of fighting in the mountains, you can let the Third Army serve as its vanguard..." Hermon also proposed at the right time. suggestions.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Davos heard this, his eyes lit up and he couldn't help joking: "Hermon, this suggestion you made is a good supplement to Alexis's attack plan. I didn't see that you still have a strong interest in military affairs." You are very well-researched. Isn't it a bit too condescending to ask you to just be the rotating chairman?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, Lord Hermon's main purpose is to want the Third Army to join this war and achieve some military exploits. As for being said to be It's a good military advice, but it's just a mistake." Antaoris said half-jokingly and half-seriously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What a coincidence, I racked my brains to come up with this. It was precisely because the Third Army was good at mountain warfare... Just because I was thinking about this along the way, I was almost knocked down by a pedestrian." Hemon. Without looking at Antaoris, he complained and touched his knees with both hands, pretending to be frightened, as if something was really happening.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Everyone laughed, and the atmosphere in the room suddenly became more relaxed. Hermon cleverly covered up the embarrassment that Antaoris secretly said that he was selfish.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos actually didn't care too much about this matter. He looked at the thin figure opposite and asked, "Haka, what do you think of this?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty." Haka said calmly: " Now Carthage has submitted to the kingdom, and the people of eastern and western Numibia have also submitted to us. The order of the southern Iberia region has been greatly improved under the iron-fisted governance of the administrator of Bagulu, Sextus The commander of the Sri Lankan Army led the 18th Army and the Border Army to join forces and defeated the invading indigenous people several times this year. He also took the initiative to massacre a Lusitanian tribe that was prone to marauding. It shocked the surrounding indigenous people... Everything is now stable within the kingdom's sphere of influence, and the country's financial and material resources are relatively abundant.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   To the east of us, the war between Sparta, Thebes, and Athens continues. , it will not have any impact on us for the time being. We should take advantage of such a great opportunity to concentrate our efforts to completely eliminate the kingdom's biggest trouble on the Italian peninsula - the Gauls, so that we can completely rule the Western Mediterranean. Obstacle!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Well said!" Davos said with a smile on his face, "Now is indeed the best time to conquer the Gauls! So I agree with the attack plan formulated by the Ministry of Military Affairs! But it only sends the first The four legions of , 2nd, 4th, and 5th are not enough. The entire Apulian region is on the Adriatic Sea side, and it is more convenient to go to the Po River plain by sea, so I decided to add the 9th and 5th legions in this region. The three legions of the 10th and 11th, as well as the first and second cavalry legions, also joined the attacking team. A total of 7 infantry legions, plus two cavalry legions, and at the same time let the first fleet As transportation and auxiliary, launch an attack on the Gallic territory from the side of Arimium!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before Alexis and the others could respond, Davos continued: "The candidate for its commander is Proseus. Right. In addition... the Third Army will be transferred to the Etruscan region to assist the northern coalition forces to eliminate the remaining enemies of Gaul in its territory as soon as possible, and then let Patroclus serve as the commander to lead the Third Army and the Twelfth Army , the Fourteenth Legion, and the Border Legion, a total of four legions crossed the mountains and attacked the Gauls' territory from the south!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Yes!" Alexis, Printors, Alps and other military ministers After listening to the doctor's order, the ministers were more or less excited: 100,000 troops!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Another large-scale war!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But compared with the Western Mediterranean War a few years ago, the Kingdom of Theonia today is more powerful and can easily send 100,000 troops to fight (mainly short-distance wars at home).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos saw their excitement and shouted to the door: "Go and call the herald."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Soon, Aristelas walked into the meeting hall.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Immediately inform the chief officials of each department that the palace is convening an important kingdom administrative meeting urgently, and ask them to come and attend immediately."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, Your Majesty."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Aristelas left, Davos turned around and looked at the rotating presidents, and said with a smile: "Everyone takes a break for a while. After everyone arrives, we will discuss how to ensure the safety of this event." The smooth progress of the war, and how to resettle the surrendered Gauls after the war, make a more detailed plan."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alpine Gaul is a semi-agricultural, The semi-nomadic race still adopts a tribal system and lives in groups. Their lifestyle determines that they are relatively closed, and the surrounding environment in which they live just aggravates this closeness.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The large-scale southern invasion 20 years ago broadened the horizons of the Gauls (mainly Senones), but it also deepened their blind confidence in their own force. They did not think that they were defeated by the Romans because The city of Rome was occupied by them for half a year. The Romans trapped in the mountains even wanted to bribe them with gold and silver and beg them to retreat...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Senones believed that they failed in the end because they captured too many places. However, the number of soldiers is insufficient, and they have to be divided into garrison. They are too dispersed and are easily attacked by the enemy; they go out to fight for too long, and the soldiers become tired of war; and there is the damn plague... If these lessons can be learned, those who are weak will The Etruscans, Romans, and Latins were all destined to become their slaves... These ideas were prevalent in the minds of the tribal leaders and warriors who fled back to Senones, so after their strength recovered, this strong Their unwillingness turned into the motivation for them to continue to invade the Etruscan territory.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, they also learned from the captured Etrunian people that Rome and some nearby city-states had been occupied by the Kingdom of Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the past few years, the Senones have only heard the term "Kingdom of Theonia" from merchants who came to Alimium to trade, and heard that it is a powerful kingdom in the south of this land.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Speaking of strong, weren't the Etruscans strong!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   We once occupied a large area of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;land in the north, but we were also beaten and fled south as hard as we could!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Rome and other Latin city-states occupied by the Kingdom of Theonia were easily occupied by us 20 years ago... There are many Senones who hold this idea, so they did not include Theonia Ya put it in his eyes.&#13;
