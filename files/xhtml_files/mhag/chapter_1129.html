   Chapter 1129 Xenophon's mission to Theonia&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I recommend a person to serve as our envoy from Sparta to Theonia. I believe he can definitely complete this mission!" Agesilaus looked at everyone's doubts. With a look in his eyes, he said loudly: "This person is Xenophon!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Cleombrotus was stunned and immediately retorted: "You are confused! Xenophon is not a Spartan, how can he be a Spartan?" Messenger!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus was not angry because of Cleombrotus' impolite words. He said calmly: "Xenophon has lived in our territory of Sparta for more than 20 years and has participated in many events with the citizens. In this battle, he did not stop waving the spear in his hand even when facing his mother-state, Athens, and his military exploits were no less than those of our soldiers. Moreover, he also used the pen in his hand to promote our Spar to the Greek city-states. The excellent political system of Dara has enhanced our influence on our allies, which is something we Spartans cannot do!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition, his son has also been serving Sparta and is still fighting in the Boeotian region. , such a Greek scholar who made so many contributions to Sparta, even though he did not have the status of a Spartan citizen, his actions have proved that he is a Spartan, and an outstanding one. Spartan citizen!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As for why I recommended him as an envoy to Theonia, it is because he participated in the Persian expeditionary force that year and later became a mercenary leader of the expeditionary force. I once listened to Lithopus I have said that Xenophon had a deep friendship with Davos, the current king of Theonia, during the Persian campaign. I believe that the effect produced by him as an envoy to Theonia will definitely be stronger than that of others. !"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Despite Agesilaus's full recommendation and Xenophon's reputation in Sparta, the conservative Spartan elders and censors still had a heated debate about this.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Finally, at the end of the twenty-second year of the kingdom (372 BC), the Spartan Council of Elders finally made a strange decision: to appoint a Spartan general as the envoy, and Xenophon as the deputy envoy Theo Nea, but all negotiations with Theonia were left to Xenophon.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This was Xenophon's first trip to the Western Mediterranean. The moment he stepped onto the passenger ship, he couldn't help but feel filled with emotion.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the past few decades, it is not that he has never had the idea of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;"visiting Theonia". Even after Theonia held a conference of Greek scholars, he invited him many times, but in the end he did not One of the reasons for going there is that he knew that Sparta, where he settled, was hostile to Theonia, and King Agesilaus of Sparta, who had always cared for him, was even more wary of him. If he goes there rashly, it will definitely make the Spartans feel grudge; and another reason is that Davos once invited him when he went to Magna Graecia, but he refused. Now Davos has created a new record in the Western Mediterranean. He couldn't rush into a big undertaking, after all, he was also arrogant.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now, Sparta has given him this task, giving him the opportunity to finally see with his own eyes the Kingdom of Theonia established by his former friend Davos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Xenophon's route to Thurii was almost the same as that of Chrysops's mission, but after more than 10 years of development, the situation was completely different.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After passing through Corfu Island, the passenger ship encountered a patrol fleet from Theonia not long after crossing the center line of the entrance to the Adriatic Sea.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is a fleet composed of four triremes and eight small and medium-sized warships. When the captain of the passenger ship told him that this was a patrol fleet from Theonia, he even couldn't believe it. , because the strength of such a fleet is close to the naval configuration of some medium-strength city-states in Greece, and some city-states are even worse than it, and this is actually just a patrol fleet of Theonia?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So Xenophon asked twice, and after getting a definite answer, he was still skeptical, and even believed that Theonia intentionally expanded the size of its patrol fleet in order to intimidate surrounding forces.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Passenger ship disembarks in Oldrum harbour.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Today's Port of Odrum has expanded several times compared to when Cleethorpes was on mission, and its sea trade scale has also increased several times. The main reason is that Theonia's conquest of Alpine Gaul in recent years has shocked the country. The forces in central and northern Italy, the Venetians, the Umbrians... have taken the initiative to show their goodwill and alliance with Theonia, and even Theonia's influence has spread to some Ili people on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea. Coastal city-state of Asia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When these forces took the initiative to move closer to Theonia, Theonia certainly lost no time in strengthening its ties with them through trade and cultural penetration.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Adriatic Sea is a natural maritime transportation route. Maritime exchanges between many Theonian towns near the sea and these newly joined Theonian allies have become extremely frequent, and Odrum is just one of them. one.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It's just that its geographical location is special. Not only can it enjoy the benefits of trade in the Adriatic Sea, but some merchant ships from the Eastern Mediterranean also dock here...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In order to meet the needs of the growing trade and tourists, Odrum not only The port was expanded and two more ports were later built next to it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Its urban area is also expanding, and the size of the entire city of Odrum has even approached Udia, the center of the region, and it has long ceased to look like the small town of Messape.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the administrator of Odrum learned of the arrival of the Spartan envoys, he specially sent people to greet Xenophon and his party, and even held a banquet to welcome them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Xenophon declined politely, and also praised him: Odrum port trade is extremely prosperous, and it must be one of the best towns in the Kingdom of Theonia. If it continues to develop like this, it will be entirely possible to compete with the Piraeus Port of Athens. Comparable.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The administrator of Odrum quickly said modestly: There are many port towns like Odrum in the Kingdom of Theonia. If Odrum wants to become a top port town, it still needs to pay more. s hard work.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Many?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ...When Xenophon heard this, he couldn't help but blinked. He felt that he seemed to have discovered a characteristic of the Deolians: they like to exaggerate the strength of the kingdom to outsiders.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After bidding farewell to the officials of Odrum, Xenophon and his party got into the carriage and headed west.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Along the way, Xenophon saw the roads built by the Theonians. They were flat, wide, solid and beautiful, and the carriages drove smoothly on them at very fast speeds. He was amazed by them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But when he learned from the coachman that roads like this had already been laid all over the kingdom and connected various towns, his previous prejudice made him subconsciously think that the other party was bragging again, because in his impression: even in mainland Greece , such a road can only be compared with the section from Piraeus Port to Athens City. The trade of Odrum Port is prosperous, and it is understandable that the roads connecting it to the outside are better, but other places are not as good. Hard to say.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But Xenophon gradually began to feel that this excellent road was too long, because the carriage had been driving for most of the day and passed through one or two towns. The road was still extending forward, and the prejudice in his heart was shaking. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When passing Tarentum, Xenophon couldn't help but look at it. The Spartans who had been friends with him over the years also talked angrily about this Spartan that was forcibly taken away by the Theonians from time to time. Zi Bang, this is one of the reasons why the Spartan people are hostile to Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, he wanted to go in and see what Tarantum, which had become the Free City of the Kingdom of Theonia, was like now, but the head of the Odrum fleet responsible for transporting them refused, thinking: Spartan will be It is their responsibility to send the envoys to Thurii safely as soon as possible, and there must be no delay in the process to avoid accidents.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Xenophon was a little dissatisfied, but there was nothing he could do.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The convoy finally arrived at the naval base not far from Tarantum. It was already dusk. The guards at the base carefully checked the official documents of the Spartan envoys and Odrum before letting them in.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since it was getting late, the Spartan envoys and their entourage could only rest for one night in the camp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Xenophon learned that this was the naval base of Theonia, so he wanted to take the opportunity to visit and get a glimpse of the armaments of the Theonia navy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Unexpectedly, the guards in the camp restricted them to stay in the house and not to move around.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course the accompanying Spartans were dissatisfied, but before leaving, Agesilaus solemnly warned them: During the mission, they should try their best to make friends with the Theonians, do not anger them, and avoid giving Spartans Brings disaster.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So the Spartan envoys chose to endure.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Unexpectedly, the second day happened to be a training day at Tarentum Naval Base. The two squadrons of the Theonia 1st Fleet sailed into the port early and were conducting formation and confrontation training.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Xenophon and the others left by speedboat at the pier, they happened to be able to see a corner of the fleet training: amidst the high-pitched bugles, nearly 200 warships were spread out in the wide bay. During the fast sailing, they were constantly The boat array is changing, and the scene is very spectacular and lively.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Naval battles were not what the Spartans were good at (Xenophon himself had never participated in naval battles), and they could not see any clues from this training, but they were still staggered by the number of three-layer propeller warships.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The size of such a fleet is close to the level of Athens' navy at its peak, so it is understandable that the patrol fleet has such a configuration... Xenophon thought in his mind.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing that they were so surprised, the captain of the Clipper couldn't help but proudly remind them: "There are more naval warships in Theonia. In addition to the naval base in Tarantum, there are also Brindisi and Kata." There are several naval bases such as Nia, Lilibi, etc., with more than a thousand warships!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Xenophon's heart moved, although this time he still felt that the Theonians were a bit boastful, but some words may be The fact is that while the other naval base Xenophon is not well understood, Brindisi is close to the Peloponnese and the Spartans had some knowledge of it, so it is possible that Theonia, which has multiple naval bases, really has multiple naval bases.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thanks to the other side of remembrance and YellowCH4 for the reward!&#13;
