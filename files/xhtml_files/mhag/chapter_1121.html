   Chapter 1121: Military meeting after the victory&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Sister!" In front of so many juniors, Agnes couldn't help but feel embarrassed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Christoya knew Agnes's temper too well and immediately changed the subject: "Okay, let's go to the zoo -" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mom, I won't go." Cynthia interjected.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This time we made an appointment to go to the zoo together, just for you. How could you not go-" Kristoya was a little unhappy, but seeing Cynthia's melancholy expression, she slowed down and persuaded: " Your father has told me that although the Gauls are coming fiercely, your husband commands a huge army of more than 50,000 people. Moreover, he also issued an order to have the nearby Twelfth Legion rush to Rome and return it to your husband. Commander...I heard that although the Gauls are fierce, they are poorly equipped and will definitely be defeated by the elite troops commanded by your husband. Don't worry!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Mother, I understand all this, but I'm still a little worried, so I'm not in the mood to play at this critical moment..." Cynthia hesitated.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Christoya asked in surprise: "In the past, when your husband went out to fight, I never saw you so worried?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Mother, Patroclus used to be an army officer. He was injured in the battle or... our family Human affairs, now that he is the commander of the northern coalition forces in Theonia, it is related to thousands of families and the safety of the northern region of the kingdom... So, how can I not worry!" Cynthia said , sighed again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After listening to this, Kristoya seemed to have remembered something, and sighed, and said solemnly: "In the past, your father led the army to fight, and there was no time when it was not related to the life and death of the kingdom. I love you and my mother. Aren't you worried! But what do we do? Try to take care of everything at home, try our best not to think about this annoying thing, and ensure our health... If your father on the front line learns that Agnes and I are sick If he falls, can he still devote himself to fighting!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Don't let your husband worry, don't think about the war, find something to do to relax yourself...In the end, your husband will get Hades My blessing!" Agnes also persuaded from the side.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Obviously, Cynthia listened to the words of the two mothers, and her worried look faded a lot. She was about to agree to go to the zoo, when suddenly the wooden door of the inner courtyard was pushed open, and the palace manager Ribazo hurried into the backyard, saluting excitedly. Said: "Your Royal Highnesses, Princess Cynthia, a great victory! Lord Patroclus led the army to defeat the Gauls who invaded Etruria!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Cynthia heard this, her face was filled with joy, and even because she was too excited, her eyes Tears flashed in his eyes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Dad has won a big victory! Dad has won a big victory!" Parpylas even danced and cheered.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I just said Hades would bless her." Agnes looked calm.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What is the specific situation of the battle?" Kristoya smiled and helped her daughter to ask another question.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ribazzo immediately responded respectfully: "I heard that our coalition forces had been victorious in successive battles and had completely defeated the Gauls who invaded Etruria... After receiving the battle report, His Majesty was very happy and had already sent five The rotating chairman and several ministers from the Ministry of Military Affairs summoned the palace for discussion."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After saying that, he looked at Cynthia again: "Your Majesty knows that Princess Cynthia is at the mansion, so he asked me to come back to inform you so that you don't have to worry."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Look, your father cares so much about you!" Christoya glanced at Cynthia angrily.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Thank you, Lord Ribazo!" Cynthia wiped away the tears of excitement in her eyes and saluted Ribazo sincerely.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ribazo hurriedly stepped away and said repeatedly: "Princess, this is what I should do. I don't deserve thanks." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Okay, can we go to the zoo now? It's all because of you that we have been delayed for so long. Eunice and Aviya may be impatient." Christoya complained pretending to be dissatisfied.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Mom, it's my fault, let's set off now!" Cynthia smiled sweetly, then squatted down, stretched out her hand, and said softly: "Chris, let Auntie hold you, let's run faster, hurry up Rush to the zoo and then go see the elephants, okay?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I want to see the lions too."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "No problem!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "And the hippos."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Cynthia held hands with the jumping Chris, hurry up Stepping out of the backyard, there was a burst of laughter.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Christoya looked at Agnes happily: "This morning, Apox went to the academy, Anteblis went to practice football, and the house is full of women. We want to have fun in the zoo. One day!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Parpilas gently pulled Christoya's hand and said seriously: "Grandma, Chris and I are boys."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Oh, by the way, we also need to add you two. Little warrior." Kristoya tapped his forehead with her finger and smiled even more happily.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Last year, after Davos' suggestion, Christoya immediately took action. After repeated discussions and surveys, she chose the Turiyi Stone Mine. The zoo is built in the hilly area near the Krati River in the south, so that the required stones, large amounts of water, and transportation are more convenient.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Up to now, the zoo is still under construction and not open to the public, but there are already elephants, lions, hippos, crocodiles... and many other animals in it. They are all allies (such as Egypt and Mauritania). I heard that King Davos has Sent specially for this requirement.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Christoya and her group were escorted by the palace guards and headed to the zoo in a carriage, Davos was discussing matters with the ministers in the palace.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, the facts prove that your decision is correct. Patroclus is indeed an excellent military commander! I originally thought that although the number of soldiers in the army he led was large, most of them were new recruits, and the sources were very complex. What he faced was They are also the Gauls who are feared by various ethnic groups in central Italy, so we have previously analyzed that with the current strength of the coalition forces in northern Theonia, if we adopt a defensive posture, it will not be a big problem to defend the Roman area, but if we want to repel the It was more difficult for the Gauls who were ravaging Etrunia. And we also think..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Military Minister Alexis hesitated for a moment, and then said calmly: "Patroclus, the commander of the Fourteenth Army, has only taken office not long ago. He has no experience in commanding multiple legions before. Moreover, he is still relatively young. I am afraid that he will not be able to let the allied generals They fully obeyed, so it was previously suggested that His Majesty send a more experienced veteran to succeed him as the commander of the northern coalition forces (since the Fourteenth Legion is located in the Roman area, the Ministry of Military Affairs stipulated that the commander of the Legion has the right to command the allied armies in an emergency. The right to defend the enemy), without His Majesty's persistence, I'm afraid this victory would not have come so quickly!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos listened calmly. In fact, the reason why he insisted on letting Patroclus continue to command the coalition forces was , not because he had absolute confidence in his son-in-law, but because he had planned to inject Patroclus into the army by appointing Patroclus as the commander of the Fourteenth Legion and Sextus as the commander of the Eighteenth Legion. The beginning of the gradual replacement of the older generation of generals with new blood is naturally under a lot of pressure. Just over a year later, sending a veteran to take over the command will not only dampen the confidence of the young generals, but also undermine the confidence of the young generals. It disrupted his original plan, so he supported Patroclus to protect his face.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, at this time, Davos was no longer affected by the history of his previous life as he was before the Western Mediterranean War. After defeating Rome and Carthage, and the rapid development of the kingdom in recent years, he was deeply aware of Dionysus. The strength of the Kingdom of Asia has far exceeded that of Rome and Carthage in this period of previous history. It ranks first in the entire Mediterranean in terms of military construction, weapons and equipment research, strategies and tactics, etc., so it once gave The Gauls, who caused a lot of trouble in Rome, were just a small problem for Theonia at this time. Even if the northern coalition suffered an occasional small setback, it would not have much impact on the kingdom, but would Let these allies unite more around the Kingdom of Theonia out of fear of the Gauls.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But he never expected that Patroclus' performance far exceeded his expectations and defeated the main force of the Gauls in less than a month. This made him very satisfied, and he had to try his best at this moment. Suppressing the complacency in my heart.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, judging from the battle report, although the commander of Patroclus' army was young, he was very calm and experienced in using his troops. He quickly marched to the vicinity of Volsena, but he did not immediately lead his troops to attack based on the large number of troops. Instead, he built a camp to lure the enemy The attack, through small victories in the defensive battle, won the trust of the Allied generals, and the morale of the soldiers was also boosted. Then he deliberately retreated and retreated to the south of the Tiber River, making the Gauls think that the Theonian army had become timid. , so he dared to attack Volsena with confidence and boldness. As a result, he took advantage of the fact that the Gauls were fighting hard for days and were tired and sleeping, so he quickly returned with his army and raided the Gauls' camp..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Pulin, the newly appointed Chief of Staff Thors analyzed seriously: "Although, this glorious victory is also related to the Gauls themselves being ignorant and arrogant. After encountering my powerful coalition, instead of fighting cautiously, they only knew how to attack blindly and had no rules for marching and camping. , but conversely, it can also be seen that the commander of Patroclus not only understood his own soldiers, the situation of the Allies, but also the situation of the Gauls. Only in this way can every decision made be in line with the battle situation at that time and allow victory. Coming so easily can be said to have mastered the essence of the "Military Law". Congratulations, Your Majesty! The kingdom has another outstanding military commander, and he is still so young!"&#13;
