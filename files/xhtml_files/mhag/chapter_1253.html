   Chapter 1253 Hades Main Arena&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I think you hope to be favored by a certain Theonian princess and become the son-in-law of the Theonian king." His teammates snorted dissatisfied.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not only did Silitaos not refute, but he whispered seriously: "Unfortunately, according to the news I heard, several princesses of the Theonia royal family have already married, and there is no chance! But if someone from Theonia can be The minister's daughter is also a good choice! I say you should also work hard to stay in the Kingdom of Theonia!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although women were prohibited from attending the Greek Games in the past, anecdotes of husbands being selected through the games still occur occasionally, and It became a good story.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   For example: Peisistratus, the former tyrant of Athens, once asked his daughter to dress up and enter sports venues to choose an ideal husband.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Silitaos is handsome, tall and well-proportioned, and is indeed likely to be favored by Theonian women.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The people next to him were also moved after hearing this, and fell into fantasy for a while.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It seems that you are ready to perform well in tomorrow's game." Megakides placed the dinner plate on the dining table and sat down opposite Silitaos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It's certain to perform well, but I'm not sure whether I can advance." Silitaos said dejectedly, but his expression was very calm: "I have carefully observed in the training room these days. The traditional racing powerhouse The runners sent by Athens, Thebes, Corinth, and Ellis this time are all very strong. Fortunately, this time Theonia has completely changed the way of racing. Everyone is not used to it. I still have a chance.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And even if I After being eliminated in the 100-meter race, I still have the 200-meter and 400-meter races. If I show up a few more times, I will have more chances of being favored by the Theonian ladies."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Megakides said Siliteos felt a little dissatisfied with this attitude of the game that did not strive to win but focused on how to win the heart of the Theonian woman, but Siliteos was a noble after all, and he did not dare to accuse, so he had to bury his head in eating.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I heard from the management of the stadium that Theonia will hold a grand ceremony tomorrow, which is completely different from the opening of previous sports games. I really want to see it earlier!" Siriteos' sigh made Mecca Kidd Si was stunned: Yes, Theonia can provide such comfortable accommodation and sumptuous food to the athletes, and what surprises will it bring to all athletes and city-state representatives at tomorrow's ceremony?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Megakides is also full of longing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;

  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hades Main Arena is the first arena since the establishment of Theonia, located in Turiene Located east of the center of the city, it is the venue for the finals of the Kingdom's rugby and football finals every year. In order to meet the needs of the growing number of football game spectators, it has undergone several large-scale reconstructions and expansions. The most recent one occurred in Dai. In the two years since King Firth announced the Games, the structure and appearance of the building are now very different from when it was first built decades ago.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The entire venue is almost a huge circle, with a height of about 42 meters, covering an area of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;more than 15,000 square meters, and can usually accommodate nearly 60,000 spectators.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It is not only a sacred place for football players and fans, but also one of the architectural wonders of the Turii region.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the early morning of July 2, 365 BC (the 29th year of the Kingdom of Theonia), bustling people gathered from all directions to the main arena of Hades.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, 69 entrances to the main arena of Hades were opened at the same time, and only one entrance was temporarily closed, which was the passage for royal members to enter and exit.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The ticket inspectors and patrol teams were in place, and the Turiyi City Hall even applied to the Ministry of Military Affairs to mobilize four reserve brigades from the Turiyi military camp in advance to help maintain order outside the arena.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Under the guidance of volunteers and guides, tens of thousands of spectators turned into a trickle, leading to every entrance. Many spectators from all over Greece handed their tickets to the ticket inspectors with some trepidation. Because they had never had to pay to watch the games in previous sports games held in Greece, this was the first time they bought tickets. They felt both novel and nervous: would such a strange piece of paper work?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But for Theonian spectators, it is natural to buy tickets to watch the game. They have been practicing it for decades. Every year, Thurii and other regions in the kingdom bring a lot of money to the city hall just relying on ticket money. The income is small, and the tickets for this sports meeting are made of a thick blue paper newly developed by the Christoya Chamber of Commerce. It is almost impossible for anyone to forge it. Just write all the games on the tickets, It took nearly a month for dozens of scribes from the Chamber of Commerce to come up with the location, date, and seat numbers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The ticket inspector mainly checks the authenticity of the tickets and whether the information on the ticket has been altered. After everything is confirmed, he will invite the audience to enter with a smile.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After passing the entrance, the audience must reach the number of floors specified on the ticket, and then hand over the ticket to the ticket inspector at the entrance of that floor again before entering the auditorium (the Hades Main Arena has a total of 4 floors, each floor The prices are different. The first level is mainly for the kingdom's elders, ministers, distinguished guests, and citizens and heroes who have made outstanding contributions to the kingdom. The fourth level has standing tickets (no seats available, and the price is the cheapest).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It's so troublesome to enter the auditorium of the arena!" Iphicrates found his seat according to the seat number on the number plate, and started to complain as soon as he sat down: "I think we Athenians are already calculating enough. Unexpectedly, the Theonians are stingier than us, and they charge fees to watch sports events. It is really unheard of!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Callistratus, who sat next to him, said a few fair words for Theonia: "This It's understandable. They provided free accommodation and sumptuous food to all the delegations and athletes, which cost a lot of money, so it's understandable that they earn some money by collecting tickets. When I entered the venue just now After asking the conductor, the price of the tickets is not high. The cheapest one is only three drachmas, and the most expensive one is only 10 drachmas (tickets for each envoy group are donated by the Thurii City Hall. Need to pay), even poor people should be able to afford it."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It's cheap, but look at how many people can sit here! After this game, Theonia can get at least hundreds of thousands or even more One million drachmas, and how many games will they have in the entire Olympic Games... Theonia can earn a huge fortune by hosting a sports meeting!" Iphicrates counted his fingers and estimated Daionia Oniya's Games Proceeds.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Why, are you tempted?" Callistratus said jokingly: "Would you like to make suggestions at the meeting, learn from Theonia, and start charging fees at the future Panathenaic Games?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Iphicrates really thought about it carefully, then shook his head and said: "I'm afraid this won't work. Let alone the fact that the Panathenaic Games does not have a tradition of charging fees. It is impossible for the public to accept it. Not to mention that our arena is open. , it is very difficult to restrict people's free entry and exit."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "If we want to build such a huge and complex arena in Athens, the funds and manpower alone are already beyond our ability to bear, not to mention that the construction technology it requires is probably something we don't have now."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Cali Stratus scanned the entire venue with cautious eyes, and finally couldn't help but sigh: "Even if we build such an arena, the number of spectators it can accommodate far exceeds the number of citizens of Athens (the city of Athens) (the number of citizens is generally maintained at 4,000~5,000), I am afraid it will take a long time to make profits back. Therefore, such a huge building and such a charging method... Only people like Theonia have strong national strength and Only a large country with a huge population can implement it!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Iphicrates was silent, he had been dissatisfied with Theonia before.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As the adopted son of the former King of Macedonia, Amyntas, he wanted to lead troops to rescue the Macedonian rebellion four years ago, but was dissuaded by the Athenian General Executive Committee and had to first seek help from Theonia, the leader of the Greek Alliance. As a result, by the time Theonia sent troops, his sworn brother Alexander had already died in battle, and Theonia did not allow Macedonia to join the Greek alliance after quelling the rebellion, but instead formed an alliance with Macedonia alone... Iphicrates believed that Theonia Nyians have selfish motives.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Neither he nor Callistrapus had ever been to Thurii. This time he came as a member of the Athenian envoys and truly saw the power and prosperity of Theonia, which was far beyond what Athens could compare with. Some other thoughts in my heart were basically dismissed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, he was still a little dissatisfied and said: "The key depends on whether Theonia can run the sports meeting well, otherwise it will be useless no matter how well the arena is repaired!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Callistratus knew something about his colleague. Psychologically, for a period of time after the end of the Greek War, he was also unwilling to accept it. However, as Theonia's dominance in mainland Greece became more and more stable, more and more Ionian city-states (Aegean Sea) Islands) joined the Greek Union, Athens's external expansion path from the sea has been blocked, and due to its alliance with Theonia, Athens' commercial channels have been greatly expanded, the domestic market has become more prosperous, and commercial taxes have increased significantly. The treasury was richer, and citizens enjoyed peace and ease more. The situation changed, and Callistratus had no intention of going against Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He did not continue the conversation on this topic, but pointed to the side and said in surprise: "Look, Agesilaus is here too! I thought he wouldn't come to this sports meeting."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
