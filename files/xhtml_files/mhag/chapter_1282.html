   Chapter 1282 Farewell to the King (2)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   King Davos's other biological daughter Aviya got into the royal carriage that followed and was not seen in front of others, which made the people of Thurii on the roadside feel a little regretful.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Because the Theonian princess was introverted and shy and did not like to appear in public, the people of Thurii did not know much about her at first, until she became the director of the zoo, because she had to take care of the animals and interact with tourists visiting the zoo. Only when children came into contact did everyone understand her kindness and innocence, and she was loved by the people.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Christoya, Agnes, Cynthia, Aviya, and the children rode in two royal carriages, followed closely by two teams of palace cavalry.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Compared to his enemy Persia, the traveling team of the Theonian royal family can be said to be very simple, but the people's support for them is far beyond what the Persian royal family can compare with.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "King Davos is victorious!!!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Hades and the royal family of Davos are victorious!!!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The people expressed their support for King Davos and his family with continuous cheers. and express their best wishes for the coming war.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Among these more formal cheers are some personal hobbies: "May Hades bless the beautiful Princess Eunice!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "May Hades bless the kind Princess Aviya!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Prince Anteblis , I love you!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Eunice burst out laughing and joked: "Antebris, did you hear that, be careful I complain to Ronya!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I don't know that woman at all, maybe I'm a rugby fan like you! Don't talk nonsense!" Anteblis quickly defended.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ronya is his wife. She was once the daughter of a rugby team owner in Thurii. She has a cheerful and generous personality and loves sports. She has never accepted Anteblis's advances and is worried that she will be restrained after marrying into the royal family. Anteblis After persevering in pursuit, the two did not get married until last year's sports meeting, making him the last of the Davos children to get married, which also settled a worry for the Davos couple.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Precisely because this marriage was hard-won, Antbris cherished it very much.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Don't worry, Ant, Eunice won't say anything casually. She can't bear to lose Ronya as a good friend!" Apox said lightly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Apox, you're the only one talking too much!" Eunice rolled her eyes at him dissatisfied. Indeed, Eunice and Ronya had similar personalities and similar interests. Ever since Ronya married into the royal family, the two quickly became They became good friends. At last year's rugby and football competitions, the two often appeared together in the stands, becoming a beautiful sight during the games.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked around with a smile on his face and waved frequently to the cheering people on the roadside, but the horse under his crotch did not slow down at all, and soon the traveling team arrived at the inner city pier.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Kingdom's administrative office, ministers from various departments, and senators from the Senate had already been waiting here. When they saw the arrival of King Davos, they stepped forward to greet him in an orderly manner and bowed respectfully.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos turned over and dismounted, looked at the five auxiliary ministers who came closer, and said seriously: "After I go to the Eastern Mediterranean, I will leave the affairs of the kingdom to you!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Your Majesty, there is no need to worry, Crotokartax His Highness has outstanding abilities, and we will definitely assist him with all our strength!" Haka said in a deep voice.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, we will do our best to maintain the stability of the kingdom and wait patiently for your triumphant return!" Sipulos said sincerely.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, we will do our best to ensure the logistics supply of the army. You can attack the Persians with confidence!" Antaoris also said immediately.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos nodded with a smile, and patted the shoulders of Bagule and Adrianx, who did not speak but looked resolute. Many matters had been arranged before, and he no longer needed to say anything more at this moment. What.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While smiling and greeting the ministers and senators who came forward to greet him, he slowly walked towards the trestle.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When he walked to the moored royal double-eye dragon ship, he was only followed by his family.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He stopped, his eyes softly swept over the faces of each family member, and finally fell on Patroclus, whom he had just called specially from the crowd, and said solemnly: "Patro, the safety of the kingdom and the The safety of the royal family will be left to you!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty -" As soon as Patroclus finished speaking, he saw Davos's unswerving expression and quickly changed his words: "Father, I will do my best to assist Croto and safeguard the kingdom. Stability!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before that, Davos asked the Ministry of Military Affairs to issue an order: Hasdrubal was appointed commander of the Fourteenth Army, followed him to Persia, and Sextus took over as commander of the northern border of the kingdom.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then he appointed his most trusted son-in-law, Patroclus, as the commander of the kingdom's reserve army, stationed at the Thurii military camp. The most important mission of this temporary position is that once there is domestic unrest, especially in the Italian peninsula, He has the authority to mobilize reserve troops from any area to quell chaos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Patroclus was reluctant to accept it at first. He wanted to participate in this grand war between Theonia and Persia, but after a detailed discussion with Davos and the persuasion of his wife Cynthia, he finally accepted it. this appointment.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos has led his troops on many expeditions before, and has never had such an arrangement. Why did he come here this time?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   That's because Davos believes that due to Persia's remote distance and vast territory, the war may last for a long time, and the Kingdom of Theonia has almost exhausted all its regular legions, and the domestic defense will be insufficient in case of an emergency. Incident, it is difficult for the army to rescue in time, so it is necessary for a most trustworthy general to sit in the kingdom and gather the remaining military resources to maintain the security of the kingdom.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, there is another important reason that cannot be said in Davos's mind: Patroclus is still young, has already made great military exploits, and enjoys a high reputation in the military. If he returns from the Persian War with great honors, other His prestige in the military will be further enhanced, which will not be conducive to Crotokatax's rule of the kingdom. Even though he believes that Patroclus's character is completely trustworthy after years of careful observation, he still has to prepare for a rainy day. , to avoid future rifts in the royal family and allow the family to always maintain harmony.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos nodded, looked at his son and future king, and said in a deep voice: "Take care of your two mothers and brothers and sisters. After I leave, the kingdom will be handed over to you. Do it well!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the conversation between father and son that night, Clotokatax certainly understood the true meaning of Davos' words. Feeling the heavy weight, he took a deep breath and replied with an unprecedented seriousness: "Yes, Father!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, don't forget to notify Agnes and I to go to Miletus when the time comes!" At this time, Christoya suddenly reminded loudly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos stared at the charming faces of the two wives and smiled softly: "You two just wait for my good news." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Grandpa, I really want to go to Persia with you!" Christophe also said Couldn't help but say.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos bent down with a kind face: "You are still too young now. When you have learned the knowledge in school and your body has grown taller and stronger, grandpa will not only take you to Persia, but also to Egypt and Greece, do you agree?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay!" Christod nodded vigorously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos smiled and pinched his little face with his hands, and finally boarded the two-headed dragon ship with the attention of his relatives.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty." The palace clerk Henipolis and the former intelligence chief Aristiras who were waiting at the entrance bowed and saluted.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, you came too late... Ahem... Our feet are almost moldy waiting on the boat!" The one complaining was Amyntas who was sitting in a wheelchair, while Alexis and Felicius The old people also stepped forward to salute Davos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Amintas, you are so old, but you still haven't changed your temper. You have to know that fighting a big country like Persia can't be rushed." Davos said jokingly, while motioning to Henipolis: " Let's sail."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Amidst the cheers and farewells, the two-headed dragon slowly sailed away from the dock. As soon as it entered the Kraty River, there were even louder cheers from all around. It turned out that both sides of the Kraty River were also crowded with people. They He waved and shouted excitedly towards this unique warship in the kingdom.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, it seems that the people are very enthusiastic about this war!" Felicius said happily.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Over the years, the people of Thurii have made great sacrifices for the kingdom. I'm afraid they hope that the soldiers of the First and Second Legions can return in triumph more smoothly!" Davos said with a sigh.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as he finished speaking, Amyntas suddenly coughed loudly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just as the two-headed dragon was sailing down the river, soldiers from the First and Second Legions were boarding the ship at the port of Thurii, and at the mouth of the Krati River, thousands of warships from the First and Second Fleets were waiting there. , they were ordered to rush back to the kingdom just last month. During this period, they have been running back and forth between the Italian peninsula and the southern gulf of the Peloponnese. They are responsible for ensuring the safety of the legion troop transport routes in various regions of the kingdom, and guarding the first, The troop transport ship of the Second Legion and the ship of King Davos were the last mission of these two fleets during this period, and of course the most important mission.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The huge fleet sailed out of the Gulf of Thurii, crossed the mouth of the Adriatic Sea, passed by coastal islands such as Corfu, Kefalonia, and Zakynthus, and entered the Gulf of Messenia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although today's Messenia is a subsidiary of the Kingdom of Theonia, most of its council members have Theonia citizenship, and Messenian citizens who were born as helots are full of gratitude and respect for Theonia. , the exchanges between the two sides are very close, in fact it is not much different from the kingdom's own territory.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, as a maritime trade relay station between the kingdom and mainland Greece, it has greatly promoted its trade development. The port has been continuously expanded in recent years. It is no longer the crude appearance it once was. It can fully accommodate the entry of this huge fleet and meet the needs of the mainland. Supply requirements for two legionnaires.&#13;
