   Chapter 1078 Turiyi's experience of renting a house&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Later, some savvy private homeowners went to discuss with the Ministry of Household Registration, and finally reached an agreement: these homeowners can publish the information of rental houses in the household registration office, and the household registration personnel will recommend it, but the price must be supervised by the Ministry of Commerce, and the price must be supervised by the Ministry of Commerce. You must pay taxes on time and accept the supervision of the rental house by the construction company. Although the homeowner has paid a certain price, with the endorsement of the Kingdom's public sector, it has naturally been favored by those in need. Later, other homeowners had to join. Come in, otherwise no business will come to your door, thus gradually standardizing the kingdom's chaotic housing rental market.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, the recommendation of public rental housing and private rental housing is a big gap, especially in Thurii. Corruption and bribery will inevitably occur, and it has been reported by the tribune many times. This aroused the anger of Davos, and ordered the Supervisory Minister to Sesta personally supervised the inspection and arrested a group of household registration officials to suppress this evil trend. To this day, this area is still the target of the tribunes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The reason why this person at the household registration office was happy to see someone wanting to rent a private house was because once the rental was successful, some landlords would express their gratitude to him, such as treating him to a meal, sending a basket of fruit, etc., because This is so trivial that the supervisory authorities will hardly care about it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The household registration officer recommended a better private rental house to him, but Maximus just turned a deaf ear. After all, he was literate, and he already had his own requirements for the rental house: first, the house should be large enough, because he has a family of four. secondly, the rent should be cheaper because he does not have enough savings and plans to use most of the money on his children's education in the future, because according to his understanding, it will take at least five or six years for him to become a citizen of Theonia. years, and during this period of time, children are not eligible to go to Theonia School. They can only go to privately built schools. Although the tuition is expensive and the quality is worse, he can't let his children We will waste this time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus read through all the densely packed rental information on the wall, and roughly identified five or six targets. Then he took out 10 Obol and bought a small piece of papyrus (the original price of a piece of paper was less than 10 Obol (but it includes the service fee of the household registration office), copied the address above, thanked the household registration officer, and then left the household registration office, taking his family with him to find the homeowner according to the address on the paper.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The first homeowner we found was a widow. Her husband was a soldier of the First Legion and died in Latium. She did not remarry and took care of her three children alone. She relied on the 30 acres of land on the Sybari Plain left by her husband while letting her Their slaves were responsible for farming and renting out houses, and they lived a pretty good life.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But when she saw that the person who came to rent the house was a Roman, she immediately refused to rent it because her husband was killed by a Roman spear, and she still harbored resentment for this.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus had no choice but to leave.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The owner of the second house he found was a disabled man, but he was a soldier of the Second Legion. He was seriously injured in the war with the Romans and had his feet amputated. He could tell at a glance that Maximus was a Roman. , without giving him a chance to speak, he kicked him out of the house.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus had been to the city of Turiyi several times before, but he always entered in a hurry and returned in a hurry after finishing his work. He did not get in touch with the residents of Turiyi as deeply as he did today. This time he was deeply involved. After experiencing the impact of that war on the Thurii people, many of them probably had a very bad impression of the Romans, which made Maximus increase his vigilance.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;finally found the third homeowner, a middle-aged man. Maximus judged from the awkward way he walked that his left leg was somewhat disabled, which gave him a bad feeling.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sure enough, the middle-aged man said as soon as he saw him: "You must be a Roman!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus felt nervous, but he had to say truthfully: "...Yes, I am a Roman. I have just gained freedom and am ready to live in Thurii, so I want to rent your house."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The homeowner did not reply directly, but looked at him, and then continued with emotion: "Although many people think that Romans and Latins are the same race, they both look the same, and they can't tell the difference. But in fact, Romans and Latins are not clearly distinguishable. Latin people are still very different. They are more confident and more imposing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Five years ago, I was the company captain of the First Legion. I participated in that large-scale war and fought against multiple races. In my memory, the battle with the Romans was the most difficult to fight. It was more difficult than the later ones. The Carthaginians were much harder to fight!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Among them, the defensive battle of Ostia is still unforgettable to me. I still remember that your Roman army launched an all-out attack on the city of Ostia. We finally fought back one wave, and then another wave came up... We fought until At night, the soldiers were too tired to stand up. They saw the corpses of your Romans lying under the city. At that time, many people thought that you had suffered heavy casualties and would rest and recuperate on the second day and would not attack again. Who would have known that at dawn the next day, you would blow the bugle call to attack, and you would attack like this for three days in a row!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ...My left leg was injured at that time... I saw some familiar comrades died in battle, and I really thought that I would follow them to Hades. Unexpectedly, His Majesty ordered us to evacuate and burn them down. Osti... At that time, many people in our legion were very unwilling! Because this is the first time that our First Army has retreated in the face of an enemy attack since its establishment. Although it is His Majesty's order... we have to admit that if we insist on defending, the First Army will probably suffer heavy casualties... &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hearing the homeowner's sigh, Maximus was silent for a long time before whispering: "...I was serving as the squadron leader in the siege team at that time. It was the battles in those days that destroyed our confidence. ...Leading to the final failure..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Fortunately, we all belong to the same kingdom now, and there is no need for war anymore!" The landlord comforted him, and then said: "You are here to rent a house, that's no problem. How much do you want to rent it for?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus thought that there was no chance for this family, but the landlord's words gave him a surprise. He immediately said: "I hope to rent the building near the Asinu-Amara Arena at a price of 100 per cent." A room rented for 8 drachmas a month.&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The landlord was about to speak when the servant standing by came up and whispered a few words. He looked slightly surprised and asked, "You are living with your wife and two children?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus nodded: "They are waiting outside the door."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The homeowner thought for a while and said: "The house on the top floor is cheap and has a larger area, but it is made of wood and is located at a high place. It cannot block the wind at night and will be cold, especially in winter. The child is still young and may get sick easily... Well, it's still the same building. There is a vacant room on the third floor that has not been rented out yet. The area is not small. The original rental price was 25 drachmas. I will rent it to you. What do you think about only receiving 13 drachmas a month?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus was surprised. He did not accept it immediately. Instead, he asked cautiously: "Why would you give such a great benefit to a stranger?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The homeowner did not feel unhappy because of his hesitation, but said sternly: "Because you are a Roman, and you are a Roman who has fought with us. Your bravery has won my admiration, and you have come to seek me." He bravely admitted that he was once my enemy. This honest behavior made me feel more at ease. In addition-"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The homeowner looked at him carefully, and then said firmly: "You should have served in a slave camp before. Logically speaking, it is impossible to be freed before the Hades celebration. But you did it. You must have performed very well." Only those who are excellent will receive amnesty! Although I lost a little money, I can get to know a Roman who is worth making friends with, I think it is worth it!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The landlord's words were frank, and Maximus was moved. He saluted solemnly and said: "Thank you for your trust. I am willing to rent the room on the third floor. My name is Maximus... My name is Brutus Mathims. Sims.&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Nisidamas, now the village chief of the village south of the slave camp, nice to meet you." The homeowner returned the greeting equally seriously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus was not slightly dissatisfied because the homeowner only named him. According to his understanding, many Theonian citizens were formerly refugees or slaves, and now they have become the first Theonian with status. The citizens of the kingdom do not want to use the name of their lowly father as their surname, but they hope to use their own name as the surname of their descendants, so they still maintain only the name without gender, which was approved by King Davos. allow.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Nisidamas asked his slaves to take Maximus and his family to the rental building.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This building is located not far to the north of the Asinu-Amara Arena, on the side of the main road. It is surrounded by busy traffic and is very prosperous, which has also caused the rent of housing here to rise.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The room type of this rental building is the most common "back"-shaped building in the outer city of Turii. It was first designed by engineers from the Ministry of Construction for public rental housing because it can maximize the use of space and provide more housing. , which can also take into account business and security, and has quickly become popular in the densely populated outer city of Turii.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The main body of this building is made of stone, about 13 meters high, with a total of 5 floors. The bottom floor is used for shops and offices, the upper 4 floors are housing, and the roof can be used for storage. Of course, private homeowners want to earn more With money, they often build wooden lofts on the roofs of buildings. The center of the circular building is an open space, which ensures that both sides of the floor can be exposed to sunlight and air circulation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus followed the slave into the building and immediately saw a square pool in the open space in the center of the building. Clear water spurted out continuously from the mouth of a statue that might be a Greek god (Poseidon). In the middle of the pool There is also a statue of another Greek god, this one he is very familiar with - Hades, the protector of the Kingdom of Theonia.&#13;
