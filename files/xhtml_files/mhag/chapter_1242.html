   Chapter 1242 Zoo Encounter&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kaunus looked at the Massilia businessman and said seriously: "Secondly, the teaching contents of all schools in the kingdom are now the same. There are fixed teaching materials for the three learning stages of junior high, middle school and high school. Don't worry. They have learned less than children in big towns;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   the most important thing is that your child can apply to the kingdom to become a Theonian citizen when he enters school. Even if he does not pay taxes to the kingdom, as long as he graduates from school , and has excellent grades and has not committed any illegal or criminal acts, then all the time he has spent in school will be included in the number of years to 'become a citizen of Theonia'. In&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   this way, he only needs to live in the kingdom and pay taxes for a few years after graduation. In the year, he can successfully become an official citizen of Theonia. Since he has studied and lived in Theonia since he was a child, he has fully adapted to the laws and customs of the kingdom and can smoothly integrate into the Kingdom of Theonia."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Massilia After hearing this, the businessman immediately showed joy. He thought that this method was completely tailor-made for him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I haven't heard of this law before. Was it just enacted this year?" Someone was embarrassed to question Kaunus, so he asked tactfully.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You guessed it right. It was indeed proposed and revised at the Kingdom Conference at the beginning of the year. It was only officially announced last month." Kaunus looked at everyone and reminded with a smile: "So if you have children who are willing to leave, It's a good time for this road!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As expected, some people had a positive discussion on the matter, and Kaunus introduced some allied businessmen to Heskraus who had cooperated with Sostatus in the early days. Under his guidance, everyone had a great time chatting.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Half an hour later Saustatus arrived at the banquet.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He first expressed his apology to everyone, and then expressed his sincere gratitude to all the businessmen present for their help during this period. Then he highlighted the upcoming sports meeting and hoped that they would all actively participate and not miss the business opportunity. He will also try his best to help them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The banquet in the front yard reached its climax, with constant clinking of glasses and constant laughter, which lasted until late at night...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Originally, Saustatus wanted to let the somewhat drunk Hesklaus stay at home, but Hesklaus considered I had to rush back to Athens early tomorrow morning, so I politely declined.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since Heskraus's pottery shop was far away and patrolled by patrols late at night, Saustatus was worried and asked Heskraus and his son to leave in his sedan chair.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Lyrias, who was originally reluctant to come to the banquet, was now very reluctant to leave with his father, so he kept complaining in the sedan chair.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hesklaus was half leaning on the couch, looking at his son who was having a bad temper, and thought of the Theonian businessmen he met at the banquet: they have been working with Sostatus for far longer than himself, and they have strong financial resources. , is more familiar with the market of the Kingdom of Theonia, but is full of envy of himself, just because he is from Thessaly and is lucky to become a citizen of Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thinking of their efforts for their children, Heskraus felt deeply that he should also make plans for Lyrias's future. He asked softly: "Son, dad has something urgent to do and has to rush back to Athens tomorrow. It will be about 20 days before I come back here to watch the sports meeting. During this period, I want you to temporarily stay at Uncle Sostatus's house. Do you think that's okay?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Liria suddenly became happy. : "Okay! Okay! Dad, do you know? Brother Chris said he would take me to the Thuri Zoo! He said there were terrible beasts and strange animals there..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hesklaus He listened to his son talking with a smile, but in his mind he was thinking about the advice Kaunus gave him at the banquet: Garaguso is a small mountain town not far from the Turii region, but due to its small population (here Lucania's most conservative and traditional tribes were once inhabited, but because it is located in the most prosperous area of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;the kingdom centered on the Gulf of Turii, many Garaguso people have been affected by it for decades. willing to live in poverty and move out one after another for a better life), it is easy to get permission from the Ministry of Education to let their children study there.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the children graduate in the future, whether they are engaged in business or politics in the kingdom, they will have an advantage over their peers in Thessaly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hesklaus secretly made up his mind: when the games are over, he will ask Kaunus to help him run this!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Early on the second day, Lylias was sent to Sostatus' house.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Facts have proved that Sosikles was not just talking about it last night. He really took Lyrias to the zoo. Of course, he was accompanied by several other merchants' children and the slaves of Sostatus' house.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Considering that foreign tourists continued to pour into Turii during this period, and the population in and around Turii became more and more dense, Sosiklis chose to take the waterway in order to reach his destination faster.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   They came to the dock along the river and hired a passenger boat.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The passenger ship set up its sails, slid its wooden oars, and sailed up the river. It passed through three large stone bridges across the Kraty River, entered the Corseni River, a tributary of the Kraty River, and finally landed at the dock on the south bank of the delta in the center of the river.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, the inland river traffic was also very busy, and it took more than an hour for the group of them to set foot on the road leading to the mountains south of the delta.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This road leading to the mountains has been reconstructed and upgraded many times: during the city-state period of Thurii, this road was built because copper mines and stone mines were discovered in the mountains, but at that time it was a dirt road. It was often run over by heavy trucks and was dilapidated, and it was even more difficult to walk when it rained. After the establishment of Theonia, in order to improve the efficiency of ore transportation, it was transformed into a stone road; but it was truly transformed into the top level of the kingdom. After the establishment of the zoo, more and more tourists went to visit the zoo. Pedestrians and pack trucks carrying minerals were mixed on the same road, which was both crowded and dangerous. Accidents occurred from time to time, and the Thurii City Hall had to The road was once again expanded into a thoroughfare. This way, the road became wider, and pedestrians walked on the sidewalk and carts walked on the main road without interfering with each other, and traffic became smoother.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The establishment of the Thurii Zoo is not new in the entire Mediterranean.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Persian royal family built a royal garden in Babylon very early. It not only contained various rare and exotic animals, but also various precious plants. The former King Xerxes (the one who suffered a disastrous defeat in the Battle of Salamis) was An outstanding gardener.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In Memphis, Egypt, the pharaoh built a beautiful garden in the backyard of his palace. All kinds of rare and exotic animals were kept in it for him and his concubines to watch.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But opening the entire zoo to the general public like the Kingdom of Theonia is indeed an unprecedented move.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Greeks like to travel, and the same goes for wealthy Theonian citizens. However, no matter how bold you are, you cannot risk your life to explore the mysterious animals hidden in deep mountains, dense forests, and large rivers. However, Thurii Zoo can completely To satisfy their curiosity, they can even get a glimpse of the monsters that have appeared in myths and legends, such as Python (a python) shot to death by Apollo, and the lion who fought with Hercules. &#226;&#128;&#166;.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not to mention the attraction of the zoo to children, and its tickets are relatively cheap, so since its establishment, it has been widely spread among the people of the kingdom. Even citizens of the allied states are attracted, and there is an endless stream of people every day. Thousands of tourists come to visit it, making it one of the most famous tourist attractions in Turii.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although there are usually many tourists visiting the zoo, it is extremely rare to see the sidewalks full of people and it is difficult to even walk like today. This is obviously because the sports meeting is about to be held, resulting in a sharp increase in tourists.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sosikles groaned secretly, he really did not expect the situation to be so bad.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When they arrived at the foot of the mountain where the zoo is located, there was already a long queue at the door. Countless tourists were anxiously waiting to pay to enter the zoo under the scorching sun.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Some people neither wanted to queue nor leave, so they yelled in the crowd: "Did the owner of this zoo have his head struck by lightning? He deliberately made fun of us tourists who came all the way! My neighbors even bragged to me. How good is this place, bullshit!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Hi! Hi!" Someone next to him patted the speaker's shoulder dissatisfied: "You are not a citizen of Theonia, are you? Don't you know that the director of this zoo is Theonia? Princess Evia, the daughter of His Majesty King Foss! If you curse a few more times and let the people of Turii hear it, they will beat you until you can't even recognize your parents!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The man was shocked. He was so frightened that he quickly shut up. Then he saw several soldiers patrolling in front of him. He felt even more guilty and slipped away quietly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sosikles had no intention of watching these farces. He asked Lyrias and the others to wait aside while he walked forward along the long line. He actually saw an acquaintance at the front of the line.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Brother Pekestus! Brother Stas!..." He shouted happily while waving his hands.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the young man named Pekestas heard the shouting, he quickly turned around and said in surprise: "Chris, why are you here?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "My dad asked me to bring some of his business partner's children to see him. Zoo, what about you?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Similar to you, several Thessaly officials brought their families to Tulii to watch the sports meeting. My father arranged for them to stay at my house and asked me to be responsible for the reception. I brought them to the zoo today. Unexpectedly, There are so many people!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "If I had known this was the case, I should have asked my eldest brother to help me take care of these children." "It's&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   not okay if you want to be lazy. Be careful, I will go back and complain to my uncle." Pekes Tas made a joke first, and then whispered: "Today's situation is not good! Maybe Princess Aviya saw too many tourists coming and was afraid of scaring the animals, so she specially posted a notice at the door, 'Only Allow 1,000 people to enter at one time, and then let people in after some of them leave the park. 'A group of people have already entered, I guess it won't be until the afternoon before we can go in." "It takes&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   so long?! Those How can the child bear it!" Sosikles turned around and looked at Lyrias and the others who were standing next to them, looking around. He rolled his eyes and whispered: "Brother, it's not okay to wait here. I'll go and think about it. Way."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Pekestus heard what he said, he knew what he wanted to do. He immediately stopped him and whispered: "Don't go! I know Aviya, she will not agree."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
