   Chapter 1280 Asia Minor Fleet The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Asia Minor Combined Fleet stationed in the port of Halicarnassus knew this very well. They even knew that there were hundreds of Theonian warships escorting these fleets, and later the Greek mainland was added. Apart from the nearly a hundred warships of the city-state, no other enemy fleets have been heard of in the Aegean Sea. The number of warships of the Asia Minor United Fleet is twice that of the other side, so after discussion, the Asia Minor Fleet decided to go north to Mi. In the waters of West Asia, capture fighter jets.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In early November, the Asia Minor fleet headed north in a mighty manner. By the time it reached the waters near the entrance to the Hellespont, the Greek coalition fleet, which had already received the news, had already fled. Unwilling to return empty-handed, the Asia Minor fleet made a gesture of returning south at dusk. , but actually quietly entered and anchored at the Port of Ilessus on Lesbos Island, not far south of the landing place of the Theonian army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Lesbos resembles two large claws of a crab. The two large claws are not completely closed, forming a bay in the center. Its entrance faces south and away from the Hellespont. It temporarily hid the Greek coalition forces, leading to the second When a transport fleet of 70 cargo ships from the Greek coalition sailed to the waters near Ilion unprepared, the Asia Minor fleet suddenly appeared and attacked it, almost destroying the entire fleet.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the attack of the Asia Minor fleet was coming to an end, the fourth Theonian fleet hurriedly arrived. The Persian Asia Minor fleet immediately gathered the warships and set up a formation to fight with it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In view of the huge disparity in the number of warships, the Theonian Fourth Fleet rationally chose to retreat, while the Persian Asia Minor Fleet was a little tired because of the previous pursuit of the scattered Greek cargo ships, and was unwilling to fight again, and then returned to Ilesu. Port of Sri Lanka.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the 2nd day, the Asia Minor fleet once again appeared in the waters near the entrance of the Hellespont Strait, but no trace of the Greek coalition fleet or fleet was found. They patrolled for most of the day and found nothing, and finally returned in frustration.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the evening of this day, the senior generals of the Asia Minor fleet held a military meeting to discuss the issue of "whether the fleet should return to Halicarnassus as soon as possible."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Most of the naval admirals from the Greek city-states in Asia Minor believed: "The Greek coalition has learned its lesson due to yesterday's failure. As long as we are still here, their fleet may not appear. And the Asia Minor fleet has a large crew, and Lesbos Island It is obviously impossible to provide enough supplies, and it is more troublesome to obtain supplies from the nearby coastal city-states of Asia Minor. More importantly, the Asia Minor fleet has already alerted the snake, and logistical supplies are very important to the Greek coalition. The Kingdom of Theonia is absolutely not If they will give up, they will definitely send reinforcements. Don't forget that the Theonians have thousands of warships!" The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Persian naval admirals believed: "Although the Asia Minor fleet has achieved some results, it is not enough to challenge the French. Nabazos's boast was not enough to attract the attention of the Persian king. Even if the fleet of the Greek coalition was avoiding the attack of the fleet, the fleet might not achieve any obvious results in the future, but as long as the fleet had more ships in this sea area If it exists for one day, it will cut off the supply of the Greek coalition forces for one day, make the Greek coalition forces afraid, and provide assistance to the Asia Minor Army that is still being formed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As for the logistics and supply issues, they do not need to worry about them. They only need to ask Panabazus for help. Naturally, they will write letters asking nearby areas to proactively provide assistance to the entire fleet. So far, there has been no news of the appearance of other Theonia fleets in the Aegean Sea. Even if they really intend to attack, they will not be able to do so in the short term. After arriving, the Asia Minor fleet can rest assured to stay here for a few more days and gain more military exploits."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although most of the warships of the Asia Minor fleet were provided by Greek city-states, the command was in the hands of the Persians. Naturally, the Greek city-state admirals could not object, so the Asia Minor fleet continued to cruise in the waters the next day. However, when they returned to their base at dusk, they received a shocking news: a fleet of Dio with an astonishing number of warships. The Nian fleet appeared near the waters of Kos and was heading north along the offshore coast of western Asia Minor.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It turned out that after receiving the order from the Ministry of Military Affairs, the three commanders of the Theonian fleet, Sekerian, Midorades, and Stephakas, after some discussions, decided not to allow the fleet to go to Croatia for the time being. After all, thousands of warships were dispatched to Crete Island, which was so loud that it would be difficult not to attract people's attention. It would inevitably arouse the enemy's vigilance and fail to achieve the effect of luring the snake out of its hole. In addition, the port conditions of Crete Island must support the three major fleets. There are also great difficulties in stationing personnel for a long time, so they decided to let the three fleets go to Messenia and Lagnia to station first.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As the most important relay station between the Holy Kingdom of Theonia and mainland Greece, the two kingdoms' dependencies have vigorously constructed port facilities in the past few years, which can fully meet the needs of the fleet and crew.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The fleet was stationed on the southern coast of Peloponnese, while paying close attention to the movements on the western coast of Asia Minor. Once a fighter plane appeared, it would quickly attack.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Davos agreed to their suggestion, the three major fleets were stationed in Messenia and Laconia. They hardly moved out at ordinary times. They occasionally trained to cultivate tacit understanding between the fleets, and only a few were deployed. warships and proceeding in the bay.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the southern waters of the Peloponnese are now the heart of the Sacred Kingdom of Theonia in the Eastern Mediterranean, it is impossible for merchant ships from Persia and Asia Minor to enter, so the Persians are completely unaware of all the Theonians in the Western Mediterranean. The Asian fleet has moved eastward.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Compared with Theonia's strict control over the western waters of the Eastern Mediterranean, Persia's management of the eastern waters is relatively loose, especially on the western coast of Asia Minor. Theonia has deployed a lot of eyeliners here, so the Persian Asia Minor fleet As soon as it was established, the Theonia fleet soon found out.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A few days after the Asia Minor fleet headed north, Theonia's three fleets left the port and headed eastward. Thanks to Theonia's vigorous promotion and funding of Greek allies in the past few years to improve port facilities and maintain shipping routes, Theonia When the Theonian fleet crosses the Aegean Sea, it can not only get timely water replenishment from nearby islands, but can even travel at night when the weather is good. Therefore, when the Theonian fleet arrives near the coast of Asia Minor, Asia Minor The fleet was still cruising in the Hellespont.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the Asia Minor fleet generals learned the news, they had no confidence to fight against the three Theonian fleets whose warships far exceeded theirs. They could not afford to provide help to the army, and immediately decided to lead the fleet back south.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In order to avoid a head-on collision with the Theonian fleet, after passing through Kaios Island, the Asia Minor fleet began to move away from the coast, attempting to sail southwest in a large circle to avoid the Theonian fleet.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Who knows that in order to prevent missing the enemy, the commanders of the Theonian fleet specially arranged for the second fleet to approach the sea, the first fleet to the remote sea, and the third fleet to connect in the middle. Each fleet has widened its front, like a big open sea. Net, to catch the big fish of the Asia Minor fleet.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It should be said that the Asia Minor fleet was a little lucky. A passing merchant ship from a city-state in western Asia Minor kindly reminded the Asia Minor fleet that "there is a Theonian fleet heading towards them ahead." The Persian generals who learned the news suddenly panicked: Facing Dai The Oonian fleet is pressing forward step by step, and it is no longer possible for the Asia Minor fleet to continue to circle westward, otherwise the fleet will penetrate deep into Theonian sphere of influence in the Aegean Sea, without any supplies, and will soon collapse without a fight. , so there is only one way before them, to get the fleet close to the coast of Asia Minor as soon as possible and hide in the port of a town to avoid the fate of destruction.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So the Asia Minor fleet made an emergency U-turn and sailed straight east, passing by Samos, trying to enter the port of Ephesus before the Theonian fleet caught up.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ephesus is a large city on the western coast of Asia Minor. Not only does the city have high walls and thick walls, but it is also rich in supplies. The Asia Minor fleet can hide inside for a long time until the Theonian fleet has to leave.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Persians had a good idea, but it was a pity that the Theonian fleet was already prepared. The second fleet led by Midorades quickly passed through the narrow Strait of Samos, and the warships were "one" in the waters near Ephesus. The characters were expanded to prevent the Asia Minor fleet from escaping eastward.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The generals of the Asia Minor fleet who learned about the situation ahead through the clippers were faced with the dangerous situation of being intercepted in front and pursued by troops behind. Like ants on a hot pot, they were panicked and at a loss. As a last resort, they led the fleet to flee in haste. The nearest port to them is Samos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Samos is separated from the mainland of western Asia Minor by only a narrow strait, which makes it, like Bosworth, one of the Ionian islands. It was once an important member of the Delian League established by Athens. , Later, after the Corinthian War, Athens' strength gradually recovered, and it joined Athens' maritime alliance again, but Athens was defeated by Theonia. Compared with Theonia, which was far away in the Western Mediterranean and was unfamiliar to Samos, The Samians were closer to Persia, and later they were attracted by some decrees issued by the Persian king in order to win over the Greeks in western Asia Minor and put down the rebellion more quickly, and finally completely turned to Persia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the Asia Minor fleet fled into the port, the three Theonian fleets arrived quickly. The sentries on the port lighthouse and watchtower looked at the endless Theonian warships spread out on the sea outside the port. Feeling of numbness in scalp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, the Somers, who once provided more than a dozen warships to the Asia Minor fleet, were lucky: although the Theonian fleet was powerful, they could not launch an attack from land after all, nor could they stay here for a long time. Soon Will leave helplessly.&#13;
