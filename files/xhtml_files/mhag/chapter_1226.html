   Chapter 1226: Negotiations with different thoughts.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "He's not here?" Callistratus was both disappointed and a little doubtful.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "His Highness led the army to Argos." Karias looked at the other party and spoke very clearly: "Because the Argos people have decided to withdraw from the Greek Alliance and surrender to our Theonia, His Highness decided to go to appease them personally. "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When will Prince Clotokatax come back?" Callistratus asked with an unchanging expression. He seemed not to care about Argos's surrender, but his heart sank: Argos Surrender?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   is this real?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The surrender of Argos, the second most powerful state in the Peloponnese, was actually reasonable. The Argos army in the previous Greek coalition insisted on going east and returning to its motherland first. Therefore, it and Iphicrates The main force of the Greek coalition led by Si separated, and was surrounded by the Theonian army in the territory of Tegea. Some of the more than 7,000 Argos soldiers died in battle, and more than half surrendered.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Printoles then suggested that Crotocathax send an envoy to Argos and ask them to surrender, otherwise all the Argos captives would be sold as slaves in the Western Mediterranean.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although 3/4 of the young and middle-aged citizens of Argos fell into the hands of the Theonian army, the stubborn Argosians still showed hesitation and did not agree immediately.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But not long after they learned the news that "the Theonian army that landed in Thessaly had invaded the Attica region, and the army led by Iphicrates had fled back to the city of Athens," the Argives Knowing that the situation was over, he decided to surrender to Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "His Highness should be back tomorrow." Karias suddenly said with an emphasis: "However, if Lord Callistratus is here to negotiate, there is no need to see His Highness, because the officials of the Kingdom of Theonia are from different countries. To perform their duties, negotiations are the responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Now, the negotiations with various Greek city-states are in charge of me, the diplomat of the Holy Kingdom of Theonia, Karias!" After&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   listening, Callistratus said, A smile appeared on his face again: "This is the best. Lord Karias and I are already old acquaintances, so it will be more convenient to discuss."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He coughed a few times, sat up straight, and said with a serious face: "Athens A war with Theonia is actually not the original intention of us Athenians. I believe you should know that the original Thurii was a sub-state established by the great general Pericles and fully supported by the Athenian people, so many Athenians People have always believed that Theonia was gradually expanded from the original Thurii, and they have a special affection for Theonia. Even if they love watching the drama "The Theonia", it is mostly because This feeling is at work, otherwise why have no plays describing other city-states been created...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Theonian army landed in Messenia and later attacked Sparta. Although we were surprised, no envoys were sent to stop it. , on the contrary, many people in Athens are happy because Sparta, which once oppressed us, is being conquered by Theonia, which has some emotional connection with Athens. This is also equivalent to a kind of revenge for Athens.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But after all, Theonia It's a foreign country. Your occupation of Sparta caused uneasiness among the Olympian priests and Delphi priests. They lobbied other city-states to make Theonia their enemies, and even affected many of Athens' allies. This eventually led to Athens also Involuntarily, he joined the Greek Alliance and declared war on Theonia..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Callistratus sighed: "But the war was cruel. A large amount of gold and silver in the Athens treasury was quickly consumed, and the people's Living materials are gradually becoming scarce, and young citizens are constantly being killed and injured in battles...The people of Athens have tasted the cruelty of war! I think it should be the same for the people of Theonia! So today I come here with the wishes of the Athenian people. It is solemnly proposed here that Athens is willing to stop the war and restore peace with Theonia!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Callistratus glanced at the other party and saw that Callias was listening carefully, so he continued: "After the peaceful truce , Athens will recognize Theonia's existing arrangements for Messenia and Sparta, and also recognize Theonia's disposal of the city-states of Thessaly, and will also persuade Delphi and Olympia to accept Theonia as a A member of the Holy Alliance of Greece.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, Theonia should withdraw all troops on the Greek mainland, and Theonia's fleet can no longer appear in the Aegean Sea.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   If Theonia agrees to the above Conditions, Athens is willing to sign a long-term peace and friendship agreement with Theonia, and is willing to open the trade market of Athens and its allies to Theonia merchants!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After listening, Karias blinked and said slowly: "The armistice agreement proposed by Athens sounds good and reminds me of the friendly agreement that Theonia once signed with Sparta.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But at that time, Theonia had to compromise with Sparta because of its strength. However, with the development of the kingdom today, His Majesty no longer allows us to sign such a self-binding agreement-" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Rely on force and blind expansion. Invasion will only arouse resistance from the Greek people and ultimately lead to failure!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Callistratus persuaded him sternly: "Only friendly exchanges and peaceful trade can make the city-state stable and prosperous!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Karias smiled: "Isn't it your Athens' continuous expansion on the sea that caused Sparta's concerns, which eventually led to the Peloponnesian War?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Callistratus&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   did not argue, but said in a deep voice: "You are right. It is precisely because of the mistakes that Athens made back then that we should learn from it today and avoid making the same mistakes again."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kalias was speechless for a moment. He drank the syrup in the wooden cup in one gulp, and then said bluntly: "I will tell you clearly, Theonia cannot agree to the condition you proposed. If Athens wants to To negotiate a truce with Theonia, I have a truce request personally prepared by His Majesty the King. Argos agreed to this request, and Theonia quickly turned from enemies to friends. Do you want to hear it? ?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Callistratus said solemnly: "Please tell me.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Karias said forcefully and forcefully: "Athens must dissolve its own alliance and join the New Greek Alliance led by Theonia, then peace will be achieved immediately, it's that simple.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as Callias&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   finished speaking, Kalalistratus said loudly: "Your request is too harsh, and Athens will never agree!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Most of the allies of Athens are sub-states of Athens and are closely related by blood to the people of Athens. It is impossible for the people of Athens to agree-" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Okay!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Greeks used to say, 'The club of Sparta, the tongue of Athens.'&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   'I have personally seen your eloquence in Athens, and I don't want to hear more from you now.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Kalias interrupted him and said firmly: "This is a request made by His Majesty, and it cannot be changed!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   If you don't agree, you can only go back and continue the war with us, and we don't care.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Callias directly wanted to meet with you, which made Callistratus lose the calmness he had when they first met. He felt bitter in his heart, but he still wanted to fight for it again: "I can't agree to these conditions you put forward now. You must return to Athens and propose it to the 500-person assembly. After discussing with the members and reaching an agreement, it must be discussed and approved by the citizens' assembly before we can give you a positive answer. This process will take about five or six days... Before Athens gives its final reply, can the Theonian army suspend its attack on Athens? To ensure that your request can be accepted by the Athenian citizens smoothly." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is absolutely impossible!" Karias clearly refused. Said: "I am only responsible for diplomatic negotiations and cannot influence the command of the military commander. If you want Athens to suffer less damage, you'd better hurry up and give a reply!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing that the other party was not getting enough, Callistratus felt in his heart Although he was disappointed, there was nothing strange on his face. He stood up and said helplessly: "Okay, I will convey your request to the people of Athens as soon as possible."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After that, he walked outside the tent and walked for a few seconds. He stepped forward, but couldn't help but look back and said solemnly: "I think you should be prepared. The citizens of Athens who advocate freedom are likely to oppose your request. For this reason, the citizens of Athens will unite to defend the city of Athens and the city of Athens with all their strength. Port of Raieves! During the Peloponnesian War, the Spartan coalition failed to break through the city of Athens for more than ten years. The war between Theonia and Athens is bound to be protracted. By then, it will be a huge disaster for both countries. A disaster!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Karias said very confidently: "Thank you for the reminder! The reason why our King dared to propose such a condition has made us fully prepared. We firmly believe that the final victory will be Belongs to Theonia! And are you Athens ready for everything? Also, I want to remind you that the Carthaginian envoy came to negotiate with us like you, but was unable to make a decision until the end. When Carthage had to surrender, it paid a higher price. I hope Athens will not make the same mistake as Carthage!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Callistratus wanted to say something, but found that he had nothing to say. He could only walk out of the military tent silently.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When he walked out of the military camp, he couldn't help but turn his head and look back: The New Greek Alliance led by Theonia?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ...The decision made at the beginning was not wrong. Theonia indeed had great ambitions for the Greek mainland and wanted to replace Sparta and become the new overlord of Greece!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It's a pity...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Callistratus turned to look at the city of Corinth in front of him. Stone bullets kept hitting the city wall. The roaring sound frightened him, and he began to worry about whether the walls of Athens could be repaired. Continuously withstanding such attacks: Yes, it is a pity that for a powerful kingdom that can dispatch 100,000 elite troops and thousands of warships, Athens' previous efforts may be in vain. What should we do next?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There is endless confusion in Callistratos' lonely eyes...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
