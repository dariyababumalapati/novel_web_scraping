   Chapter 1204 Theonia vs. the Greek Coalition&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   . Most of the generals agreed with the first suggestion, and everyone also agreed with the second suggestion, but there were still some different voices.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "We agree with your opinion, General Iphicrates. It is very important to ensure the safety of our retreat. Chrysis must be in our hands!" This was a positive response from the generals of the Athenian maritime allies.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Thebes is a traitor. It was their collusion with Theonia that led to the terrible situation in Greece today. They must be punished! Not only must we control Cleucis, but we should also allow other city-states in the Boeotian Alliance to obtain Independence!" This is the cry from the people of Phokis and Locris.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "We have a large number of people, and Thebes should agree with our suggestion. There is no need for us to stimulate the Thebans more to prevent them from giving up neutrality and turning to Theonia. Now we should first defeat them The Theonian army is the most important thing!" This is the opinion of the generals of Corinth, Argos, and Megara.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Only a few of the Boeotian generals who had joined the Greek alliance remained silent.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Iphithrax's suggestion was quickly recognized by the generals, which made Jason realize that just relying on a large number of troops could not ensure that he could command the entire coalition army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A few days later, the Greek alliance's troops began to gather towards Corinth.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, the messenger sent by Clotokatax arrived in Mandinia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Commander Theonia hopes that we will withdraw all the people stationed in Tegea and defend the city of Mandinia for a while..." Lycomedes, who read the letter, said to the others in the council with a solemn expression. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As one of the advocates of establishing the Arcadian Alliance, Lycomedes was originally elected by the citizens of Mandinia as the main member of the Arcadian Alliance, shouldering the important task of forming and improving the alliance.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But after Mandinia annexed Tegea, conflicts of interest occurred with other city-states in the alliance. Although the quarrel was temporarily subsided in the end, rifts had already arisen between Mandinia and other city-states. Several Mandinian MPs headed by Si were obviously alienated and excluded by other city-state MPs.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just at this time, the envoys of the Greek Alliance came to Megalopolis and threatened the Arcadian Alliance "must immediately tear up the covenant with Theonia and join the Greek Alliance, otherwise it will be attacked by the coalition forces."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After learning about the staggering number of Greek coalition forces, and because the main force of the Theonian army has now completely retreated into Spartan territory, the Arcadian Alliance faced the threat of the Greek coalition forces and felt a lot of pressure, so most congressmen began Hesitation, and a few people made it clear that they could accept the envoy's request. Only Lycomedes and several other Mantinian MPs firmly opposed it. Their fierce emotions also caused the Arcadian Alliance to not respond to the envoy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But at night, the envoy secretly contacted and discussed with representatives of several city-states, but did not come to Lycomedes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So at the Arcadian League meeting on the second day, when the issue continued to be discussed, the resolution to "sever ties with Theonia and join the Greek League" was passed by a plurality of votes. Lycomesko could not accept this. As a result, he angrily criticized the alliance's short-sightedness, believing that such treacherous behavior would inevitably be punished by the gods.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Lycomedes then led several Mantinian councilors to decisively leave Megalopolis and return to the mother state, which actually meant the break between the Mantinian and Arcadian alliances.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, after listening to Lycomedes' words, the MPs in Mantinia all felt nervous. Someone asked urgently: "Now that the Greek League has gathered a large army in Corinth and is about to invade south, we in Mantinia are not like other Acres." The city-state of Dia also betrayed its covenant with Theonia and will surely become the first target of this army's attack. Shouldn't Theonia fulfill its covenant and rescue us?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Messenger Karias faced the excited Man The Dinian councilors said calmly: "Judging from the current battle situation, the enemy's strength clearly exceeds our Dionyian army in the Peloponnese. At this time, we have a head-on confrontation with them. , is not a rational approach, so His Highness Crotokatax hopes that you can hold on to the city of Mantinia first, wait for the new reinforcements from Theoria to arrive in the Peloponnese, and then decide the victory with the enemy. Lose!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Our Theonian country is powerful. The regular army alone is no less than 200,000 people. As long as there is enough time for them to reach the Peloponnese, they will definitely win this war! Of course now The enemy force is strong. If you feel that there are not enough manpower, we will send reinforcements to help you defend the city."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Mandinian councilors were a little surprised when they heard that the Kingdom of Theonia had no less than 200,000 soldiers, and gradually calmed down.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In their view: The Theonian army is very powerful. It only sent an army of 30,000 people to easily conquer the tyrannical Spartans, and there are so many soldiers in the country. It can't be easier to send. With tens of thousands of people, it is definitely not difficult to defeat the so-called Greek coalition.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Commander Theonia asked us to abandon Tegea. Is this a temporary abandonment? Or a long-term abandonment?" Lycomedes asked worriedly. This is because Mantinia broke with the Arcadian Alliance. , causing his previous hard work to be in vain, the reason was because of Tegea. He did not expect that after the war was over, Mantinia's bamboo basket would be empty, and he would get nothing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Of course it is a temporary abandonment." Karias understood the thoughts of the Mandinians to some extent, so he said loudly: "Since we Theonia have promised, the land of Tegea belongs to Mandinia. 'Then this promise will never be changed! In addition, I also brought another promise made by His Highness Crotokatax..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kalias said, taking out a letter from his arms Pass it to Lycomedes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Lycomedes took the letter, and after reading it, he looked at Callias with surprise.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Karias said loudly and solemnly: "Our wise and wise King Davos once said, 'Only in times of crisis will you know who your true friends are.' We came to Peloponnese Although it has not been long, it has experienced many betrayals. Only you, Mantinia, have always stood firmly on our side. Even if the enemy army pressed the border, you have not wavered!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Your performance has won the trust of Theonia. , so His Highness Crotocatacus made a promise, 'After the victory of the war, he will fully support Mantinia in reorganizing the Arcadian Alliance!'"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Karias's words made the entire assembly hall They all became excited, and they all said: Mantinia will fully defend this city in accordance with Theonia's requirements, waiting for the arrival of Theonia reinforcements!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, Lycomedes also swept away his previous depression and began to conceive in his mind: This new Arcadian alliance must no longer be as indifferent as before, but should be like Thebes in the Boeotian alliance. , with Mandinia as the absolute center!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A few days later, the Greek coalition entered Arcadia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After failing to persuade them to surrender, they surrounded the city of Mantinnia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And on the second day, the Thessalian army, which was the most active, took the lead in launching an attack on the city. However, the Mandinian defenders, who had been reinforced by the two Theonian brigades, easily defeated the coalition's offensive.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the following days, the coalition's siege failed to make much progress and had to temporarily turn into a siege. Its main force continued to move south, seeking a decisive battle with the Theonian army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Two days later, the Thessalian army in the vanguard captured the city of Tegea.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Tegea was an empty city at this time and no fighting had taken place, the news still shocked the rest of the Peloponnese city-states who did not understand the truth.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Soon, the Arcadian Alliance fulfilled the new covenant and sent 3,000 soldiers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ellis, who had been hesitant, finally sent an envoy to the coalition forces and asked them to "join the alliance."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even the city-states in Achaia, which had remained neutral before, sent envoys to make the same request.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   For a time, the Greek Alliance's power and prestige increased greatly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After discussion, the coalition generals headed by Iphicrates and Jason decided: the armies of Elis, the Arcadian Alliance and the Achaean city-states would attack Messenia, and the main force of the coalition would attack Sparta.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Greek coalition forces continued southward and reached the border of the Arcadia region, but what they did not expect was that since the Theonian expeditionary force occupied the Spartan territory, in accordance with the instructions of King Davos, the Ministry of Military Affairs issued an order : Points out that various Greek city-states are forming a coalition in an attempt to defeat the expeditionary force, so Crotocatacus is asked to lead the army to secure the territory of Messenia and Laconia and wait for the opportunity to counterattack.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotocathus obeyed the order and accepted the advice of several generals such as Printors. He built multiple defensive camps along the traffic arteries and mountains on the northern border of Sparta and Messenia. Tens of thousands of soldiers participated, and the Pilians and the original Helots also responded positively...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, in just two months, the Theonian army has initially established a more systematic defense on the two borders. facility.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Greek coalition forces were soon stymied by these complex Theonian defense camps.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Especially in the northern part of Sparta, where there are continuous mountains and narrow passable terrain, the superior strength of the coalition forces cannot be deployed at all, and camping and rest have become a big problem.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Theonian army held on to the dangerous terrain, not only blocking the enemy's offensive, but also through night attacks from time to time, constantly causing casualties to the Greek coalition soldiers who had to disperse and camp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
