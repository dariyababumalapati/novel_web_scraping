   Chapter 1196 Reunion with Sparta&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After hearing this, the expressions of the three Tegea councilors changed greatly, and they immediately ran towards the north.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The protagonists who came to ask for an explanation suddenly left, and the other Arcadian Alliance councilors looked at each other, not knowing what to do for a while.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Printors immediately said in a deep voice: "The Spartan coalition has been defeated. Taking advantage of this favorable opportunity, our army will soon invade Sparta and completely solve this problem that has caused continuous wars in Greece for decades. To bring peace to the Greek people! So we can't waste any more time here. After the war is over, we'll celebrate the victory with you!" After that, he performed a military salute and then turned his horse's head.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After listening to Printors' words, all the congressmen present felt as if they were in a dream: Sparta, their ally for decades and the country that had dominated Greece for hundreds of years, was about to end?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, Printors turned around again, his eyes fell on Lycomedes, and said: "By the way, I forgot to tell you that the Tegeans tore up the alliance and attacked our army. They are no longer Theonians." An ally of the Sacred Kingdom of Asia, but our enemy, the captured city of Tegea is naturally the spoils of the Theonian army!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In order to show that our Theonian troops came to the Peloponnese this time, To fulfill the covenant and assist Thebes in defeating Sparta, rather than greedy for Greek land, and also to thank the Mandinians for their great help to our army in this battle, our commander gave this trophy as a gift It was given to the Mantinians, and they gladly accepted it."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After finishing speaking, Printors flew away in the dust, leaving the Arcadian councilors alone with their thoughts in confusion: "What do you mean by this?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This Don't you understand? The Mandinians want to occupy the land of Tegea!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A group of people quickly surrounded Lycomedes, who was also unaware of the situation, and kept questioning&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ... &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Crotocathax and Tagetinos joined together, they led nearly 18,000 soldiers into Spartan territory.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After passing through a section of rugged mountain road, we came to the Eurotas Valley and walked along the winding and narrow valley. At dusk, we finally arrived at the defensive camp built by Sparta.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The small camp could not accommodate so many soldiers. Each legion and each brigade had to find separate places to camp. Fortunately, no accidents happened that night.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The soldiers who had not slept well the next day set out very early and continued to move forward. Finally, at daylight, they walked out of the valley and entered the open hilly area.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After this arduous journey, Clotokatax realized more deeply how helpful the 1st Fleet was to the army by conquering Sparta in advance.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Towards noon, the army finally approached Thelasia, the first town in Sparta.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Knowing that Sekerian was leading the senior officers of the First Fleet to greet him in front of the village, Crotokatax also led Printors and other senior officers to ride over.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before Clotokatax could dismount, this well-known hero of the kingdom, who was dressed in velvet, had dark skin, and was calm and confident, took the initiative to greet him and solemnly performed a military salute: "Your Majesty Commander, Commander of the First Fleet. Sekerian reports to you!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax immediately dismounted, returned the military salute solemnly, and then praised loudly: "General Sekerian, congratulations on occupying Spartan territory. Created great glory! Relying only on fleet infantry, we successfully landed on the heavily defended Spartan coast and defeated the defenders. This is very amazing! It also provided great help to the entire expeditionary army and was conducive to the execution of our next plan! "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Klotokatax's unstinting praise made Sekerian and the generals behind him feel happy. Sekerian laughed and said seriously: "Commander, I'll tell you the truth. Well, when you took office in Messenia, the reason why I didn't go to see you was actually because the last time the 1st Fleet failed to land on the coast of Sparta, nearly a thousand soldiers were killed or injured. It was my command error, so it's really I have no shame to see you. This time I finally got what I wanted, whether it is honor or not is another matter, but the big stone that has been weighing on my heart has finally fallen, and now I dare to come and apologize to you."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seck, who has always thought highly of himself Why did Li'an put down his posture and take the initiative to show his kindness to the young commander this time?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mainly because he has been in a high position over the years and has gained some political wisdom. He gradually realized the reason why the battle-hardened King Davos made the young Clotokatax the commander-in-chief in such an important war. In order to Considering the rest of his life and the future of his children, he had to remain humble to make up for his previous mistakes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as he finished speaking, there was a heavy hum from behind Clotokatax: "Since the 1st Fleet is so powerful and can do it both at sea and on land, if there is a war in the future, we might as well just send the 1st Fleet alone. It's settled!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian took a closer look and saw that the speaker was Olivers, a very senior military veteran. Although Sekerian was not afraid, there was no need to offend him, and at the same time, he also gave Cro Lotokatax left a bad impression, so he said with a smile: "Our 1st Fleet was able to capture Sparta because, Commander, you led the army to attract Spartan forces in Arcadia. The main force. Moreover, I also heard that you fought a fierce battle with the Spartan army in Tegea and completely defeated the Spartans. This was also a brilliant victory! Without this victory , without our army, even if the 1st Fleet captures Sparta, it will eventually be recaptured by Sparta's main force!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What Sekerian said was reasonable and made the legion commanders feel comfortable listening to it. , the unhappy look on his face quickly disappeared.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This also greatly changed Clotokatax's impression of Sekerian. He took over the conversation and said seriously: "It was through the mutual cooperation and joint efforts of the army and navy that we won the victory against Sri Lanka. The victory of Sparta! Next, we need the close cooperation of the navy and army to successfully defeat the Greek city-state armies that are hostile to Theonia! But now we must first deal with the matters after Sparta's defeat as soon as possible before we can free up our hands. To deal with the challenges of other Greek city-states. Lord Sekerian, how is the situation in Sparta now?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian glanced behind Crotocathax and felt a little strange: He was so concerned about the newly appointed The commander of the first legion, Ktissus, is familiar. He is a very active guy, but why does he seem a little quiet now, and he seems to be a little uneasy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, he had no time to think about it now and first answered the young commander's question: "We have imprisoned all the people in the city of Sparta. Now the entire city of Sparta, including the surrounding villages and towns, has been captured by my subordinate fleet. Occupied by infantry and soldiers of the 7th Legion.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   You may not have imagined that when our landing army approached the city of Sparta, the main defense force of the Spartans had been completely lost. They actually organized the elderly, women, and children in the city to fight against us..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   " You didn't kill too many people, did you?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax blurted out and asked.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seclian glanced at him and said: "No, because we know very well that the Spartan people are more useful than dead."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At that time, I used the soldiers of the Seventh Legion as the vanguard to launch an attack and quickly defeated the Spartan people. However, in the process of capturing them, I encountered strong resistance from some people and injured many of our soldiers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now, many Helots have fled to the mountains, and the Piliasians have hid in their own villages and towns, all watching.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I don't have many troops, and it's not easy to control the villages and towns of Sparta, so now I'm eagerly looking forward to your arrival!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   's frankness made it difficult for Clotokatax to say anything more in this regard. He just asked: "Have you found any broken troops from the north in the past few days?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "There is no news in this regard for the time being.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian's answer made Clotokatax frown slightly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Commander, don't worry, we have the Spartan people as hostages. Those Spartan soldiers who escaped have only one way to surrender. Before I It was this method that forced the dozens of Spartan soldiers stationed in the northern defensive camp to surrender.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian comforted him and said.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotokatax pondered and said: "General Sekerian, before coming to the Peloponnese, my father once told me that he did not intend to annex the Peloponnese." The land of Sparta, but to change the political system of Sparta and make it an ally friendly to the kingdom..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian was stunned after hearing this. After all, he was not very good at government affairs and couldn't help but remind him. Said: "Although those Spartan elders and inspectors have become our prisoners, they have very tough tempers and are not easy to yield. What should we do to make them obey?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos had mentioned it before. During his stay in Peloponnese, Clotokatax also made repeated thoughts and deliberation based on the actual situation. He already had some plans in mind. He was confident that Said: "We can first..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The group of people walked in the direction of Sparta and said. More than an hour later, they saw two tall bronze warrior statues standing on both sides of the road ahead. They only wore Corinthians. The helmet revealed a strong body, holding a shield gun and a saber. While posing in a charging posture, he roared, seeming to frighten any stranger who wanted to enter the center of Sparta.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Ahead is the city of Sparta.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian said.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Everyone was refreshed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After bypassing the bronze statue, sparse thatched mud houses began to appear in front of them. They were no different from most of the houses seen in Messenia. Crotocata Kes knew that this should be the house where the helots lived.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
