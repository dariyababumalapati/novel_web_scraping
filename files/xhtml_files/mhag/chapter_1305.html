   Chapter 1305 Persian Strategy (End)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This is simply ridiculous!" Mardonius loudly interrupted Trebassus and angrily rebuked: "It is already too late to retreat without fighting and allow the enemy to occupy our land. It's embarrassing enough! We have to drive the people away and destroy their property. Do you think they don't hate the army enough and want to provoke them to riot!" "Your&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Majesty, now that the Theonian army has invaded the border and the situation is tense, the situation is particularly tense. Rebasus's use of such ridiculous tactics will only disrupt the kingdom and affect the army's operations. I request that he be severely punished!" Halpurgus also immediately criticized.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Artaxerxes also looked hesitant, but remembering that Trebassus had always been very resourceful and his favorite, he suppressed the displeasure in his heart and asked coldly: "Trebassus, Why do you do this?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Trebasus ignored the accusations of Mardonius and the others and said calmly: "Your Majesty, King Theonia is a greedy man. In the past few decades, he has annexed one city-state after another. , controlling the entire Western Mediterranean. This time when he invaded the kingdom, he definitely wanted to occupy Asia Minor, Syria, Phoenicia, and Canaan. His goal must be our entire kingdom, so he brought nearly 200,000 troops.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But the consumption of these 200,000 troops every day is very huge. It is not enough to rely solely on the few areas he occupied to provide supplies. Food and materials are transported from the Western Mediterranean thousands of miles away, and transportation routes It is too long and consumes a lot of time and manpower, not to mention that once the Theonian army continues to advance eastward from Syria, it will be more difficult to transport supplies. The best way for the Theonian army is to collect them on the spot. Scraping food and supplies.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mesopotamia is rich in the world, and now the people have just completed the food harvest, which can fully meet the needs of the Theonian army, but -" Trebassus said with emphasis: "Once we After taking the measures I just mentioned and assuming a posture of fortifying the walls and clearing the country and returning to defend Babylon, the Theonian king must be very anxious because he will be worried that his army will not be able to survive after it invades the Mesopotamian plains. It is impossible to obtain supplies on the spot, and Babylon is a famous fortified city with heavy defenses, which cannot be conquered in a short time. Therefore, in order to avoid such a bad situation, he will definitely take the initiative and seek a decisive battle with us!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haha! , It's so simple to say, but what if the Theonian army is not fooled and still cowers in the camp!" Orontas sneered and questioned.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Lord Orontas, haven't you understood what I mean?" Trebassus also responded with a sneer: "The Theonian king went on a thousand-mile expedition and wanted to conquer our huge kingdom. He could only quickly Victory, maintaining such a large force in Syria for a long time without taking any action will only greatly consume the national power of Theonia. The king of Theonia will not be so stupid!" "Maybe&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   he will wait for Greece. After the coalition forces unite, they will attack eastward." Halpurgers then questioned.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Then we can have enough time to evacuate all the people west of Babylon without leaving a grain of food for the Theonian army. Then the Theonian army with a larger lineup will have to march more than a thousand miles to Babylon. It is impossible to obtain supplies nearby, and our powerful cavalry can also bypass the main force of the Theonian army and constantly attack their baggage transport teams. In this way, I am afraid that the Theonian army will collapse before it reaches Babylon... The ambitious King of Deolia would never want to see this happen, so I think he will definitely lead his army to chase me!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Halpurgus sneered: "He will definitely chase him?! Terry Bassus, the Theonians are not your subordinates and will listen to you like this. What you said are just guesses, and the kingdom has to pay such a high price based on your guesses. This is not worth it at all. !"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not to be outdone, Trebassus said sarcastically: "It's really rare for Lord Halpurgus to actually start caring about the people of the Mesopotamian plains! I remember that the army you led was related to this person. The people in the area have the most disputes, and they still refuse to change their ways even after the king issued a new military order."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Halpurgus became angry and cursed: "Who are you, how dare you-"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay!" Artaxerxes Si patted the seat hard and shouted solemnly: "This is not a place for you to curse each other and show your personal grudges! Trebasus, are you sure that the Theonian army will leave the camp and take the initiative to fight a decisive battle with us?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After passing After the argument just now, he saw the three Mardonios sneering silently at the side. Trebasus was already in a difficult position. He took a deep breath and said resolutely: "As long as you implement the plan I just said. , the Theonian army will definitely take the initiative! We will pay a heavy price, but as long as we can defeat the Theonian army, then your king will not only be able to recover Syria, Phenicia, Canaan, western Asia Minor, and Cyprus , you can also take the opportunity to recapture Egypt, regain control of Greece, and threaten the mainland of Theonia again... so it is all worth it!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Defeat Theonia, recapture Egypt, control Greece, and regain hegemony in the Eastern Mediterranean... Special The words of Rebasus moved Artaxerxes. The old king was eager to win a glorious victory to wash away the failures he had suffered in the past. However, this decision was of great importance after all, and he was still a little hesitant, so he decided He turned his attention to his beloved general who had been silent all this time: Pesitidai, what do you think?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Pesitidai is self-aware. Although his status is considered prominent, he is still far behind these important ministers of the kingdom. Therefore, he did not intend to participate in the quarrels of these important figures, but now Facing the question of the King of Persia, considering that he and Trebasus were both close ministers of the king, and that Trebasus usually took good care of him, he considered his words and said euphemistically: "Your Majesty, our army The advantage lies in the cavalry and archers. If the Theonia camp is attacked, the cavalry will be completely unable to function, and the power of the archers will also be greatly weakened.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And if we can lure the Theonian army to fight in Mesopotamia, the vast plains will allow the cavalry to gallop at will, and allow arrows to shoot at the enemy without any hindrance, we will be more certain to win.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Artaxerxes nodded. After pondering for a moment, he finally made up his mind. He looked around at everyone and suddenly raised his voice, making his voice a little hoarse: "I have decided to adopt Trebasus' suggestion and send Taposa to the throne. All the people around and west of Cus were evacuated, all the villages were burned, and the city of Taposacus was destroyed. At the same time, all the troops retreated to Nicephonia..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing what the three Mardonius wanted After speaking, he immediately waved to stop, and at the same time looked at Trebasus sharply, and said sternly: "If the Theonian army did not catch up as you said, but continued to huddle in the camp, I am We will not continue to implement such measures, and you - I will never forgive you lightly!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Artaxerxes only adopted half of Trebassus' suggestions, and he was forced to do so. In recent years, a series of failures such as the failure to attack Egypt, the rebellion in Asia Minor, and the loss of control of Greece made Artaxerxes' His prestige was greatly lost and his subjects were dissatisfied, so this time he only dared to make a small attempt, but did not dare to make most of the residents on the Mesopotamian plain homeless to avoid completely falling into passivity.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Trebasus was a little disappointed, he also knew the reason why the King of Persia did this, so he could only pretend to accept it calmly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mardonios and the others seemed to have seen the tragic fate of their political opponents and no longer questioned it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The top brass of the Persian army reached a consensus in this way.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After listening to Izam's introduction to the details of the Persian army, all the serving commanders of the Theonian Army strongly requested Fight a decisive battle with the Persian army as soon as possible. Among the retired veterans, except for Philisius and Geogris who are more cautious and hope to wait for the reunification with the Greek coalition before taking action, Alexis, Amyntas, etc. People also suggested that "we should take advantage of the fact that the morale of our own army is at its peak and the organization of the Persian army is still relatively chaotic, so as to lead the army eastward as soon as possible to look for fighting opportunities."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The generals were full of fighting spirit, which also strengthened Davos' determination.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the second day, after he issued the order to "prepare to march eastward," the soldiers of each legion began to pack their luggage, and the transport battalions began to load supplies. The engineering battalion inspected various equipment and prepared some wood...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, Davos also informed Dai Vos Midorades, commander of the Onian joint fleet: led the fleet to the camp as soon as possible. After the Theonian army left, all fleet infantry immediately took over the camp to ensure the safety of the rear base.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Theonian The army is well-trained, but for such a large army to go to an unfamiliar battlefield and attack the Persian army, it requires detailed planning and rigorous organization of operations. Therefore, it took three or four days to complete Theonia. The whole army was ready to march eastward.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the main force of the army set off on the fifth day, the scouts hurried back to report: The Persian army entrenched near Taposacus was driving the local people to retreat eastward. At the same time, they also burned fields and villages, and even destroyed the city of Taposakus...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This news surprised Davos, but he did not stop the entire army's actions and reconvened a military meeting to discuss the Persians. What is the purpose of the move?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In his view: No matter whether the Persians are choosing the tactics of clearing the wall, retreating and defending, or using a false retreat to lure the Theonian army to advance, not only will it not change the action plan of the Theonian army, On the contrary, it will strengthen their determination to fight with them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
