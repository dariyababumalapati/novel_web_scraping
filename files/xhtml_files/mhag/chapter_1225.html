   Chapter 1225 Shaken&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Cablias looked slightly embarrassed and explained in a low voice: "In the morning, the Theonia fleet approached the port of Piraeus. At that time, there was already news that the border defense line was destroyed by Theonia. With the news that the army had broken through, the city was in chaos... In order to prevent accidents, I ordered the port to be temporarily closed... The Theonian fleet has also approached the port of Piraeus several times before, and we have done the same. But I never thought that the reason why the Theonian fleet did this this time was to cover up their attempt to capture Aegina!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I remembered, you did tell us that 'Theonian' In order to prevent the loss of the Asian fleet threatening the port of Piraeus, we all agree with the order to close the port." Callistratus' face became extremely ugly: "But now Aegina is under attack Attack, what should we do?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Cabrias hesitated only for a moment, and then decided to make up for his fault. He resolutely said: "Aegina must not be occupied by Theonia. I request to lead the fleet to attack first, attack and Divert the Theonian fleet away, and you send a fleet to carry reinforcements, take the opportunity to enter the port, and defend the city of Aegina!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The generals all knew that Cabrias's plan was very risky, but at least half of them said without thinking They agreed, because they all knew: Although the Theonian fleet is powerful, it has not yet been able to completely block Athens' maritime access. This is because they are stationed in the southern Peloponnese and go back and forth every morning and evening. There is always a period of time. The gap cannot cruise in the Saron Gulf, but if Theonia occupies Aegina Island, which is very close to Athens, since Aegina Island has complete military port facilities, they can park the fleet directly in Aegina The island is like holding a dagger directly to the chest of Athens. It can threaten the port of Piraeus 24 hours a day. It will be a huge disaster for Athens.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Generals, although I have conveyed their request to you in accordance with the request of the Aegina crew, I do not want you to send the fleet out of the port!" The official of Piraeus Port said with an extremely solemn expression: " According to the crew of Aegina, two fleets came from Theonia, one surrounded Aegina Island, and the other blocked the port of Piraeus. Their number may have exceeded 600 ships, so they rushed out of Aegina. All 20 warships in Ina Port were rammed and sunk. Only this fast ship used their cover to finally rush into the port...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   and there were only 75 warships in Piraeus Port, risking an attack. I'm afraid it will suffer the same fate. If Athens does not have the protection of warships, I'm afraid the punishment from the gods will come!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After hearing this, the generals were shocked.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before the Persian army attacked that year, the Athenians asked the oracle at Delphi for a prophecy: The wooden walls would protect Athens!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Under Themistocles's instigation, the people believed that the "wooden walls" mentioned in the oracle were warships, so they spent huge sums of money to build warships. As a result, the naval battle of Salamiga, dominated by the Athenian fleet, became a Greek legend. The turning point of the Persian War also made the people of Athens believe in the Oracle of Delphi and passed it down from generation to generation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now Athens is facing great danger. If the warships that Athens relies on will also be destroyed, these generals will feel panic and at a loss from the bottom of their hearts.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, even Caboulias, who had been resolute just now, became a little confused.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Let's make peace with Theonia." Iphicrates sighed softly: "The matter has come to this, only in this way can we save Athens!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Iphicrates' words shocked everyone, and the room fell into silence. Before his arrival, it was not that no one thought about making peace with Theonia, but no one raised it, because it was the generals' executive committee who reached a consensus that incited the citizens of Athens to oppose Theonia. hostility, and finally declared war on Theonia, and now it has only been a few months to change course. The generals who first proposed this resolution will undoubtedly bear more anger from the citizens of Athens.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But Iphicrates' words pierced this window paper. The Theonian army was about to attack the city, and the island of Aegina, which was a sea barrier, was invaded. Athens, which was in danger, had no other choice.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the urgent citizens' meeting, when Callistratus proposed "peace to Theonia", he originally thought that he would be criticized and obstructed by the citizens, but he did not, because no matter from what point of view, The citizens who retreated from the western border, the citizens who followed Iphicrates in the Peloponnese for several months, and the citizens who were on tenterhooks on warships every day, dealing with the Theonian fleet... none of them Exception saw the strength of the Theonian army and was eager to end this terrible war. He had no intention of holding the General Executive Committee accountable.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The proposal was quickly approved, and Callistratus's initiative to apply to be an envoy to the Theonian army was also approved.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Early on the morning of the second day, the earth shook outside the city of Athens and dust filled the air. The Theonian coalition appeared in the sight of the sentry at the top of the city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After receiving the news, the citizens of Athens quickly put on their armor, picked up their shields and spears, and rushed to the city to prepare for defense.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, the Theonian coalition forces were already well-positioned below the city. They saw waves of soldiers, forests of spears, countless flags waving, countless armors shining... Seeing the citizens of Athens, their eyes were dizzy and their hearts were tight.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Hades!!! Hades!!! Hades!!!..." The Theonian soldiers shouted in unison, like a thunderous burst, causing the Athenian citizen soldiers to fight in two groups.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even with the momentum of the Theonian army, Callistratus walked out of the city gate, walked directly into the Theonian army, and met Patroclus, the commander-in-chief of this army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But when he proposed that "Athens wanted to negotiate an armistice with Theonia," Patroclus shook his head and refused, and told him: The power to negotiate an armistice with the Greek alliance was under the command of another Theonian army. The officer was in the hands of Prince Clotokatax.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Callistratus had no choice but to ask: Can the attack on Athens be suspended while Athens and Theonia are negotiating?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Patroclus refused outright: Unless an armistice agreement is signed, the Theonian army under his command will never stop attacking the city of Athens!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hearing this, Callistratus had to rush to the Peloponnese immediately.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Patroclus lined up under the city of Athens, just to show the military power of the Theonian coalition and undermine the morale of the Athenians.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He knew very well that the city of Athens would not be captured easily, so he soon issued an order: the army built a camp two miles away from the city of Athens.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Callistratus rushed southward, passed through Megara, and entered the city of Corinth.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Corinthians took the initiative to ask him about the battle situation in the north. He falsely claimed that Athens gathered all the soldiers in the city and defended first. Now it has easily repelled the Theonian army's all-out attack on the city and is accumulating more strength. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He came this time to discuss with Theonia at the request of the Athenian people, hoping to retrieve the remains of Athenian citizens who died in the Peloponnese.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Corinthians were doubtful, but they were certain of one thing: the Athenians were already defending the city and it was impossible to send reinforcements to them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the way to the Theonian military camp, Callistratus saw the Theonian army arrayed under the city of Corinth, and their use of a type of ballista specifically mentioned by Iphicrates. The siege equipment and the continuous bombardment of the city wall with stone bombs were really amazing, which made him feel the urgency of the situation even more.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Iphicrates also once emphasized that the Theonian army was good at building camps and had the habit of "building camps wherever they go."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This time the Theonian army built a camp next to Ismia, the port of Corinth on the east side of the isthmus. He heard from the Corinthians that not long after the Theonian army arrived at the city of Corinth, they attacked Ismia with all their strength. Due to their large number and fierce attack, although the Corinthians carried out reinforcements to the port, the port of Ismia with poor defense facilities only lasted for half a day before being submerged by the raging black tide.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Standing high on the coast, Callistratus could even see the many Theonian warships anchored in the port. He could think of the reason why the Theonian fleet began to land on Aegina. The attack was precisely because they occupied the port of Ismia, not far from Aegina. With a foothold, they could better blockade the port of Piraeus and continuously attack the people who landed on Aegina. The army provided support...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The heavy-hearted Callistratus entered the relatively simple Deolia camp under the leadership of the Theonian officer and entered a military tent.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There was only one person in the military tent, and surprisingly it was Karias who had been on a mission to Athens before.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kalias smiled and took the initiative to greet you: "Master Callistratus, welcome to your arrival! You have been working hard all the way from Athens. Please sit down and have a rest. I have prepared something cold for you. Please quench your thirst first!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Callias was very respectful and did not smell arrogant at all, but the title of "Lord Callistratus" still made the chief general of Athens feel that he With the sharpness behind his words, he increased the vigilance in his heart, but a smile quickly appeared on his face: "Thank you very much! You are so thoughtful!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After saying that, he sat down unceremoniously and picked up his hand. He poured himself a glass from the clay bottle on the table, drank it all in one gulp, and then said cheerfully: "This water is indeed delicious!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Karias also returned to his seat and said with an apologetic look: " Lord Callistratus, you asked to see His Highness Crotocathax, but unfortunately he is not in the military camp now and cannot see you."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
