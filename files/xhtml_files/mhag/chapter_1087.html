   Chapter 1087 Lysias and Milon&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Do you support it? Or don't you support it? Let's be honest and stop being so long-winded." Milon said impatiently.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Since you want to be the regional chief executive, don't be anxious. We will analyze the situation slowly and clearly before we can discuss good countermeasures." Lysias said dissatisfied: "If you just want me to say Just say it happily, okay! I agree to support you, you can go back!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay! Okay! I was wrong, you say it, you say it." Milon had no choice but to give in.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Logically speaking, with your qualifications and political achievements, it shouldn't be a big problem to become the chief executive of the East and West Sili regions..." Lysias said,&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Of course, if it weren't for Sipulos' cleverness, he would have done it long ago. Leading the people of Trina to support Theonia, King Davos will be more favorable to him, otherwise I would have had the right to compete for the position of wartime governor of Sicily." Milon said with some annoyance.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Lysias's face changed slightly, and he immediately advised: "Don't talk nonsense! Senator Sipulos is smart and capable. Not only did he make great contributions in the Western Mediterranean War, but after becoming the rotating chairman of the Senate, he joined us to assist His Majesty. For The kingdom's recovery after the war also provided a lot of help... If these words of yours fall into His Majesty's ears, I'm afraid your wish to become the regional chief executive will be frustrated." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I'm just telling you, how? You would be foolish enough to spread the word everywhere, you are too careful." Milon said disapprovingly: "Besides, His Majesty made a promise today that he will not interfere in the selection of the regional chief executive."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Lysias's expression suddenly became serious Standing up, he said in a deep voice: "Myron, as your friend, I solemnly warn you that it is best to always remain in awe of His Majesty Davos! Over the years I have been the rotating chairman, I have spent a lot of time with His Majesty, and he is far away It's much more powerful than you think! If he knows that you are disrespectful to him, he will have many ways to prevent you from becoming the district chief executive, and I will have to stay away from you in the future!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Milon was killed by Lucia Swift's attitude was startled, he was stunned for a moment, and he quickly changed his words and said: "How dare I be disrespectful to His Majesty! What I'm doing is just... Okay! Okay! I swear to Hades that I will never talk nonsense again in the future. !... Now tell me, what are my chances of becoming the chief executive of East and West Sicily?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Lysias did not answer directly, but asked: "How many years have you stayed in eastern Sicily?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Including Na. The time in Xosos should be 8 years!" Milon raised his fingers and counted them, and he couldn't help but sigh.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Eight years is indeed too long!" Lysias also sighed: "You still remember what happened with Antonios and Laodissian."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Milon suddenly felt a chill in his heart: "You mean..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   " I think you should know that in order to prevent the incident from happening again, very few elders have been able to serve as chief executive of a town for more than 10 years, or even 8 years. Although you are in two different towns , but they are too close and belong to the same region. If you become the chief executive of the East and West Sili regions, it will definitely take more than 10 years... I think during the election, there will definitely be some elders who also covet this position and will criticize it. With this problem of yours, it's almost impossible for you to get elected!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This..." Milon slumped down in his chair as if he had been hit in the head, but he immediately realized something, managed to pull himself together, and asked: "What did you just say? Supporting my participation in the election, does it mean that-"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Lysias smiled and said: "Although it is unlikely that you will become the chief executive of East and West Sili regions, with your qualifications and political achievements, you can definitely compete for other regions. Chief executive, do you have any intentions?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "His Majesty just announced this proposal this afternoon. I only want to run for the chief executive of the East and West Sili regions. I haven't had time to think about other things... But since the chance of becoming the chief executive of this region is not If you are big, you can also run for chief executive of other regions." Milon quickly figured it out.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Then let's take a look. Which region's chief executive is more suitable for you and easier to win?" Lysias analyzed calmly: "The chief executive of the southern region of Iberia has been determined to be Baku. Le, the administrator of the Roman region is Asistes, the candidate for the administrator of the western Sicily region... Although His Majesty has not publicly announced it, it should not be you. Excluding the East and West Sicily regions...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   By the way, there is another one Crotone region, if you want to govern our hometown, I am afraid some elders at the meeting will question it, saying that you want to be selfish. In order to avoid trouble, we will also exclude it. Next...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Corsica Although there are not many towns and a large population in the northern region of Sardinia, the mining and smelting of various metals there are very important to the development of the kingdom, so its importance in the kingdom is not low. Stromboli The last time he took up the post of wartime governor of Sardinia was because of the urgent needs of the kingdom during the war. He himself is old and lacks energy. He has long been tired of serving in the local area. It is estimated that he will not take up the post of Sardinia again this time. District Administrator, if you are interested, you can compete. However, you have never had experience in managing a mine before, which may be a weapon for your opponents to attack." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I have no interest in being a mine foreman. Milon said simply: "I have stayed in Sicily for too long. Since I can't serve as the chief executive of East and West Sicily, I don't want to stay in Sicily anymore..." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   That said, you won't compete with Mexico either." The chief executive of the Sina Strait region, the Syracuse region, and the southern Sicily region..." Luciens said, suddenly realizing something, looking at Milon and asking: "Do you already have a goal?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mi Long grinned: "I was also inspired when I was talking to you just now. What do you think of the chief executive of the Mesapeu Region?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The Mesapee Region... If we talk about the few years after the kingdom just conquered it, if it wanted to govern it, It is still very difficult to treat the people there. Now more than ten years have passed, and the Messape region has long become like other regions in Magna Greece, and it is not difficult to govern. In this way, it has been newly divided in the kingdom. There are no special features among the dozen or so regions.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The population in this region is not large, the land area is not large, and there is some fertile farmland, but the output is not ranked among the top 5 in each region. There is also some good livestock farming , but it cannot be compared with the Bruti region and Lucania region. It has maritime trade and land trade, but it is not very prosperous... Such a country seems a bit mediocre in all aspects, and its strength in various regions of the kingdom is only It's a region in the middle, why did you choose it?" Lysias was a little confused. He knew that Myron was not a person who liked mediocrity. On the contrary, he liked to be aggressive in doing things. Choosing the Mesapei region seemed a bit inconsistent. his personality.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The Messape region has a characteristic that other regions do not have." Milon smiled mysteriously, and then said seriously: "It is closest to the Peloponnese Peninsula! Closest to mainland Greece!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You mean..." Lysias seemed to understand something from Milon's slightly excited face. He was surprised, but shook his head and said: "This is impossible! The kingdom's current strategy is still Developing northward, not to mention that the kingdom has not recovered from the Western Mediterranean War, and the benefits gained in the war have not been fully digested. It is impossible to launch another war in a short time..." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course I understand this." Mi Long still insisted on his opinion: "But sometimes the situation develops rapidly, and it is not what we want. Just like the Western Mediterranean War, we also insisted on developing northward. In the end, no one expected that Carthage would be the first to attack us. Declare war.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The situation in Greece is complicated. The war has lasted for so many years. Maybe at some point a certain city-state paid a certain price and asked the kingdom to go to quell the war, which impressed His Majesty and the Senate. After all, our Theonia is so powerful and far away. With the Greek mainland so close, it is impossible for these Greek city-states troubled by war to have no ideas..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this point, Milon leaned back and said leisurely in a more comfortable posture: "Since the Roman regional administrator The candidate has been decided, so I can only choose the Mesapee region to take a gamble. Maybe a war will really break out during my tenure? At that time, maybe I can take advantage of it like Sipulos. , because the naval base Brindisi is close to Messape, and Odrum, the closest port town to mainland Greece, is in the Messape area, and the Athenian navy also landed in Corky not long ago. Pull the island, let this Greek island very close to the Messape region depend on them..." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   You, although you have not led troops to fight in person for more than 10 years, you are still so eager for war..." Lysias said helplessly He shook his head, and then said: "Since you chose the Mesapee region, we can do this... let someone nominate you as the candidate for the chief executive of the East and West Sili regions first. After the nomination fails, it will be the turn of the Mesapee region administrator. During the election of the chief, you took the initiative to express your willingness to participate in the election.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since your first failure was not due to lack of political performance and qualifications, but just because of the unlucky reason of "too long in office", the elders are likely to switch to you out of sympathy. I support you. Of course, to be more secure, I suggest you talk to Antaoris tonight and seek his support." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Antaolis... Since I came to Sicily, there have been 8 I haven't had much contact with him in years." Milon seemed a little regretful.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It has nothing to do with it. We knew Antaoris before joining Theonia. You have had a good relationship with him over the years, and according to the new regional division, his mother state (Crimea) Sa) was also included in the Crotone region, we all belong to the same region..." Lysias encouraged with a smile.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay, I'll be there soon." Milon replied simply.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
