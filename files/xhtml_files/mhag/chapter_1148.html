   Chapter 1148 New Messenia&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Dolios heard this, his expression changed drastically, and it took him a long time to squeeze out a sentence: "...We have the support of Persia..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides sneered: "It's really an irony. Remember. When we first joined the military camp for training, we set the goal of defeating Athens and Persia. Unexpectedly, the Spartan warriors today are proud to be vassals of Persia."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Dolios blushed and couldn't say anything. Words come.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "For the sake of saving my life, I will let you go back to Sparta tomorrow. By the way, you can truthfully tell Agesilaus and the Council of Elders what I said before, so that they can understand that Dai Why did Onia send troops to Messenia, and at the same time, you also want to tell Agesilaus..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leotychides stood up and said loudly: "I, Leotychides, am in Messenia. Wait for him!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Come here!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The guard walked into the tent, and Dolios shouted emotionally and unwillingly: "Leotichides, after all, you are the prince of Sparta, your ancestor. You led the Spartans to create the glory of Sparta. Do you really have the heart to destroy this motherland that gave birth to you and raised you with your own hands?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides replied firmly without hesitation: "Now Sparta is in A Only under the rule of Gesilaus, the Council of Elders and the Overseers will they go to destruction. Only under the rule of Theonia will the Spartans be reborn!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After saying that, Leoticides handed over his hand. With a wave: "Take him down."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Muklu returned to his tent, he did not rest. The news that "Leotichides was most likely a Spartan" made him uneasy, even though he and Leoticides had worked together for many years and had a deep friendship, but after repeated ideological struggles and considering the possible serious consequences of this matter, he decided to report to the military judge.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just as he was about to leave the tent, the guards came to inform him that Commander Proseus wanted to see him immediately.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Muklu hurried into the big tent, and as soon as he saw Leoticides, he couldn't wait to ask: "Commander, are you really a Spartan? And you are also a Spartan prince?!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   No. Wrong, I am the only son of the former King of Sparta, Agis, and my original name was Leoticides." The commander of the Theonian expeditionary army looked at Muklu calmly, with a serious look on his face. Said: "After my father died of illness, my uncle Agesilaus used a trick to seize the throne, suppressed me, and forced my mother to death. I had to escape from Sparta and came to Theonia. Considering my own special identity, and in order to avoid being hunted by Sparta, I hid my identity..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After accepting this military mission, Leoticides considered that one day his true identity would be revealed. He was mentally prepared, so he spoke so frankly. This made Muklu feel a little relieved, but he still said with some worry: "Sir Commander, after all, Sparta is your motherland, as ours When the army is fighting the Spartan army or attacking Spartan territory, can you really give orders calmly and without any interference?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides replied impatiently: "I have already said that I He is a citizen of Theonia, Sparta is now our enemy, and I will never show mercy on the battlefield!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Muklu nodded, but was still a little worried: "I'm worried that the soldiers will learn the news. It affects morale..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This requires you as a staff officer to help me more. But you don't have to worry too much. Once I lead the army to fight the Spartans again, all doubts will be eliminated." Leotychides said meaningfully.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the past, there were adjutants in the establishments above the brigade in the Theonian army. The adjutant's duty was to fully assist the military commander.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In recent years, the Theonian army has undergone new reforms. The position of adjutant has been abolished and a staff officer has been added. This increase and decrease has no change in the number of people, but there are obvious changes in responsibilities. The staff officer is appointed by the Ministry of Military Affairs. Assigned by the Staff Office, he not only helps the military commander handle various military affairs, but also has the power to recommend military operations and supervise the military commander. He also has temporary command power when the military commander is injured or unable to command for other reasons. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay, leave this matter to me." Muklu responded seriously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as he finished speaking, the tent was pushed open, and Tertotis broke in and said eagerly: "Father, I heard that you are a Spartan?! Is this true?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Muklu immediately asked Leo Tichides gave a wink that said, "Look, the news has gotten out."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Where did you hear this news?" Leoticides immediately asked seriously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The Spartan prisoner has been shouting loudly, and many soldiers have heard it. Is this true?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides realized that this was Dolios deliberately disturbing the morale of the soldiers. His face was gloomy, and he immediately called Guards, give the order: Beat Dolios first, and then gag him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing Leoticides explaining in detail to his son, Muklu quietly walked out of the tent...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Several legions who got the news The captain, military judge, Tisias and others came to visit one after another, all wanting to ask Leoticides whether the rumors were true and prove the situation. Leoticides had not said as much in the past year as he had in these two days. Naturally, I was not in a good mood.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the news that "Commander Proseus may be the prince of Sparta" caused a commotion in the army, this did not affect the various departments of the expeditionary army to work as planned after occupying Messenia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the Spartans evacuated the Messenian plains, a small number of them hid in the mountains to the north (the garrison of Pylos, after receiving the news, decisively retreated to the northern border of Messenia). Some of them were hiding in the pass fortress in Taygetos Mountain, unwilling to fail. They started a raid on Theonia's army last night. The well-trained three legions and the 1st Fleet infantry were heavily guarded and did not suffer Too big a loss.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Another day later, Leoticides, who had been temporarily freed from the rumors, issued a new order: let the Sixth Army go to the northern border to build defensive camps and protect the security of the territory; the Fourth Army was stationed in Taygetos. A camp was built outside the pass to block the Spartans' shortcut to Messenia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Tisias and other Messenian Theonian citizens took a small number of soldiers and painstakingly traveled through various villages in the Messenian territory, killing or capturing Spartan Sheriffs and other Spartans. , constantly preaching to the Helots that "the Spartans have been driven out of Messenia by the Theonian army, and they have gained freedom...".&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then he enthusiastically talked to them about the friendship between compatriots, conveyed to them the good intentions of the Kingdom of Theonia, and encouraged them to be brave enough to build their own city-state.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, they also distributed the food and supplies they looted from Spartan homes to these poor helots.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This team was followed by legionary medical staff, who took the initiative to treat the helots who were suffering from diseases.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Helots, who had been treated like cattle and sheep by the Spartans since birth, had never enjoyed such kindness. They were all moved to tears and cried everywhere. They firmly attached the term "Theonia" to their hearts. Keep it in mind.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The vast majority of helots had no education and had worked in the fields all their lives. It was impossible for them to participate in the governance of a city-state. However, due to the small population of Sparta and the frequent wars in the past few decades, there were not enough people. People came to manage Messenia, so they appointed a small number of Messenians as village chiefs of each village. Apart from paying less taxes and having more freedom, they had no more rights. They encountered the young Spartans. Soldiers hunt and kill them regularly, and their death is in vain.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Once the harvest in the entire village was poor and the tax revenue was insufficient, these village chiefs would be severely punished, ranging from beatings with sticks (the Spartans were famous throughout Greece for their stick punishments, which were extremely harsh, and they were often beaten to death or maimed). Yes, the same is true for the people of the allies, so many Greeks publicly said that the Spartans were cruel and barbaric), and in severe cases, they cut off their hands and feet, so they also lived in fear.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But precisely because of this, they have good management capabilities.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Tisias brought them together and invited them to participate in building and governing a new Messenia, and they were all overjoyed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, the future leadership of Messenia will mainly be held by this group of citizens from Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Davos summoned them for discussions, he also issued a special order: allowing them to stay in Messenia to retain their status as Theonian citizens.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   According to the laws of Theonia, dual nationality was not allowed to appear originally. The reason why special exceptions were made for this group of people was because Davos considered that after defeating Sparta and capturing Messenia, it would not be possible for the time being. Incorporating this area into the Kingdom of Theonia would otherwise arouse the common hatred of the entire Greek population. Therefore, allowing the Messenians to be autonomous and fully dependent on Theonia has become an important issue for Theonia in mainland Greece. Supporting force, so this group of people is the key. They will become the mainstay of the future Messenian high-level, so it is very important to retain the identity of Theonian citizens and keep them committed to the kingdom.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   These people headed by Tisias also know that time is running out. News of "Messenia regaining its independence" will soon spread throughout Greece, and the exiles may return here one after another. They must form a government as soon as possible and create a set of The stable operation of the political system makes it difficult for latecomers to follow suit.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, the political system of New Messenia has already been formulated in the Theonian Palace: Messenian Theonian citizens and Helot village chiefs formed the Messenian Council (a total of It is 223 people, known as the 300-person parliament, of which Theonian citizens account for 65%), responsible for the formulation of laws, diplomacy, war and other important affairs, and then the council elects 5 members from the council members every year , formed a general executive committee to be responsible for the internal affairs of the city-state and leading troops in combat...&#13;
