   Chapter 1178 The Battle of Tegea (4)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax's unintentional words flashed through Printors' mind like a ray of light. His eyes suddenly widened and he punched his thigh hard: "Mercenaries do not have the ability to execute such a large-scale fraud, but there is a city-state in mainland Greece that often uses such tactics to win!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotokatax, who has served in the staff department, is not lacking in military skills. Knowledge, he blurted out: "You mean the Spartans?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, they are the Spartans! We were fooled by Agesilaus!" Printors said eagerly with some annoyance: " No wonder their left wing has not performed well so far, because they are not Spartans at all, they just put on Spartan uniforms. The real Spartans are still on the right wing they are most familiar with. Silas used this little trick to confuse us!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax understood. He tried his best to suppress the nervousness in his heart, but the anxiety still seeped into his words: "Quickly...send out the messengers immediately. Rush to inform... Ketis... Commander of the Ketisus Army! Tell him that there are Spartan warriors on the opposite side. They are pretending to be defeated! Don't pursue! Be careful of their counterattack!" "We&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   also need to send out more messengers and notify them separately. Commander Trotilus and Oliverus, let them seize the great opportunity of the Spartans' false defeat and disordered formation, increase their offensive intensity, and maybe they can find a breakthrough in our center and right wing!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Printor Si's suggestion was quickly adopted and ordered by Clotokatax. At the same time, he gradually regained his calm, and said happily: "Lord Printors, thank you for discovering the Spartans' conspiracy in time! Now it seems that as long as we respond in time, the Spartans' false defeat will make the battle more favorable to us, right?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax's words once again stunned Printors: With A With Gesilaus' ability, is it worth taking such a big risk but not getting a good return?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He suddenly remembered something and shouted: "Bring me the battle map again!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Taking the wooden board from the staff, Printols' sharp eyes quickly swept across the map, and finally focused on the blue figure in the corner. On the colored vertical bar, there is a line of very small words written below: 4000-5000 Tegea allies.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Printors finally understood where the uneasiness in his heart came from: "We received news before that Tegea was attacked by the Spartan army and suffered heavy casualties. If we don't rescue it, it may be captured... But the situation is like this How can poor Tygea still send so many soldiers to fight?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotokatax was shocked, and immediately had a terrible idea, and couldn't help but shudder: "You mean... The Tegeans lied to us. They were actually acting with the Spartans, but those corpses..." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Your Highness, we don't have time to pursue the details!" Printors said anxiously, poking at the map with his hand. : "Now that Tegea's army appears at the rear of the First Army, I can be sure that they will work with the Spartan army to attack the First Army from the front and rear. This is the real conspiracy of Agesilaus. We We must rescue immediately!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Ah... yes, rescue..." When Clotokatax thought of the possible consequences, he was so nervous that his mind went blank for a moment.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Quickly notify the Seventh Army and rush to the left wing immediately to rescue the First Army!" Printors issued the order eagerly on his behalf.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The messenger who received the order subconsciously looked at Crotokartax.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax waved his hand and said eagerly: "Follow the order issued by Chief of Staff Printors!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The orderer turned his horse's head and ran towards the rear.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Unexpectedly, not long after, Taigetinos came over on horseback and asked: "We have not received news that the Taigeans are attacking the first legion. These are just your guesses. What if the Taigeans simply attack?" If there is no rebellion, our seventh legion's trip will be in vain! If there are abnormalities elsewhere at this time, the seventh legion will be too late to rescue!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   If we receive news that the Tegeans are attacking the first legion, we will go there again. Rescue, then it will be too late! If something goes wrong, I am willing to take responsibility!" Printors responded without flinching.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It's my order." Clotokatax looked at Tagetinos. Although his voice was not loud, he could not refuse: "Immediately execute it, Commander of the Tagetinos Army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   " North couldn't say anything more, so he glared at Printors, and then hurriedly performed a military salute on his horse: "Yes, Commander, may Hades bless you!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then he rode back, old You can still hear his roar from far away: "Brothers, your chance to make a contribution has come! Stay alert, follow me, and accelerate towards the left wing of the military formation!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!!!!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Looking at The billowing dust and smoke raised by the soldiers of the Seventh Legion made Crotokatax calm down and said seriously: "Lord Printors, I believe in your judgment!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Thank you for your trust, Your Highness!" Printols Si showed a wry smile and said softly: "I hope my judgment is wrong."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Congratulations, Lord Commander of the Legion, our first One legion has defeated the enemy's right wing!" The guard captain excitedly congratulated Ctissus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Ctissus was excited, he was also a little confused: "Strange, before we thought that the enemy on the opposite side was not simple. I am afraid that the first legion will encounter a hard battle. There are no obvious signs. Victory suddenly comes. Pu. Tris, what do you think is the reason for this?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ctissus was asking his staff officer.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Legion Commander, I think... we should inform each company not to rush to defeat the enemy, but to control our own soldiers first, maintain formation, and pursue cautiously to prevent accidents!" Putris suggested cautiously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ctissus hesitated. After all, he had finally defeated a strong enemy. At this time, if he did not take advantage of the victory and pursue it, but slow down the pursuit, it would give the defeated enemy a chance to breathe. The previous battle would have been in vain...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This At that moment, the scouts from the First Legion hurried over to report: "Report to the legion commander, that Tegea army is rapidly approaching us!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "These shameless Tegeans! They didn't come out to help us when we were fighting hard, but now that the enemy has been defeated, they come out to take the credit! Bah!" Ctissus spat and looked at the sound of the bugle with disdain. From the rear that kept ringing, through the gray dust and mist, he could clearly see the high Taigea flag and the dark crowd, and the front of the team was rapidly extending to both sides...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the battlefield Ctissus, who had been struggling for decades, suddenly felt a very bad feeling, and he couldn't help shouting: "The Tegeans are too close to us! Go tell them immediately and ask them not to follow. Behind us, go to other places to fight the Spartans!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the messengers took the order and left, Ctissus still muttered uneasily: "Something is wrong with the situation. Look at the posture of the Tegeans. It's not like they're here to pick up bargains, but they want to charge..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Legion Commander, you still have to be careful. Although Tegea is already our ally, we don't understand it at all, and we have never had it. We fought together." Putris reminded with some worry.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After listening to the staff officer's words, Ctissus finally no longer hesitated. He immediately issued an order: "Notify the companies at the rear of the military formation to stop advancing immediately, line up backward, and prepare to defend!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Five or six messengers rode up at the same time. Go out and rush to the front to give orders to the company that is still running.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Legion Commander, some soldiers are defending on the spot, and some soldiers are still pursuing... In this way, the strength of our First Legion will be dispersed. Why not simply stop the entire legion from advancing!" Putris suggested again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ctissus did not expect that he would face such a difficult choice in the first battle when he became the commander of the army: partial defense and partial pursuit could prevent dangers and expand the results, but it would lead to the dispersion of troops and great risks; And the entire legion stopped pursuing and defended on the spot. What if the Tegeans had no ill intentions towards the first legion?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then the victory will be wasted, what a pity...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is one of the reasons why Ctissus has been unwilling to serve as the commander of the legion: making a choice is too troublesome!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But soon he didn't have to worry anymore, because he saw with his own eyes that the messenger who stopped the Tegea army suddenly turned over and fell off his horse, falling to the ground motionless, with a javelin stuck in his body.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The Tegeans are the enemy! Sound the bugle immediately and stop the entire army's advance!" Ctissus shouted eagerly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Originally, he and the staff officer led the guards, the reconnaissance team, the mountain reconnaissance team, the messenger team, the bugler team... to follow the First Army Corps. Now that the situation is critical, they are running forward desperately, otherwise the First Army Corps will The command center will directly face the impact of Taigea's army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Woo!...Woo!..." At the same time as the first legion's bugle sounded, the Tegyaya people also let out a thundering roar and accelerated their advance.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, they were only more than 200 meters away from the company of the First Army that was lagging behind.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After receiving orders from Ctissus, the officers of these companies and divisions took the time to gather the scattered soldiers and reorganize their ranks. Before they could form a unified defense line, countless Tegeans came over like a tide. , rushed into the sieve-like First Legion, seeming to drown all the Theonian soldiers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Shield defense!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Brothers, don't panic! Keep defending, our reinforcements will be here soon!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But in this chaos, the hysterical shouts of the officers of the First Army kept ringing. Small phalanxes of detachments stood like rocks in the tide.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
