   Chapter 932 Discussion of Carthage's new fleet&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But in the Carthage Senate, the atmosphere in the venue was not only not as relaxed as the people imagined, but also very solemn.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the Sofitel election in Carthage that just ended in October, Occreton was re-elected again. However, standing in the center of the Senate, he was not overjoyed after winning. Instead, he said to everyone with a solemn face: "Fellow senators, I believe you have received the news. Our Phoenician allies in Sardinia, Olbia (Albia), Salos, Santa Ibinia, and Kalaris, have successively sent envoys to us to ask for help. We are stationed at The judges in Sardinia also sent back detailed news that the Theonians, who were as greedy as hungry wolves, were eyeing Sardinia after capturing Alenia in Corsica.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   They dispatched a fleet that not only patrolled the waters of Sardinia, but also frequently landed on the coast near various towns on the island. They sent troops to attack villages, destroy mines, and even incited slaves and launched riots... Now Sardinia The situation on the island is becoming chaotic, and the people of the allied states are also very panicked. As the leader of the Phoenician city-states in Sardinia, we in Carthage cannot see them in trouble. Do you want to send reinforcements immediately? Elders, please tell us. Your opinion. "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Needless to say." The leader of the neutral faction, Esiyaruba, stood up and said solemnly: "The most important pillar of our Carthage treasury income is the precious metal trade, and Sardinia and Corsica are our Carthage's treasury revenue. One of the important sources of the precious metal trade in Thagia, not to mention that Sardinia is also one of the important sources of trade income for our Carthage merchants. Therefore, we must not only send troops immediately to rescue Sardinia, but also Alenia of Sica was recaptured."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Asyaruba already has a high prestige in the Senate, and Sardinia is indeed related to Carthage's fundamental interests, so his speech was echoed by many senators.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Taipanlaco immediately took over the conversation and actively made suggestions: "Fellow senators, there is actually a Phoenician joint army of tens of thousands on Sardinia. The Theonians simply do not dare to compete with it. It's just that the cunning Theonians always use warships to avoid their stations and attack areas with empty defenses.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, considering that the battle in Sicily is currently going on intensely, and we are also very short of soldiers, we do not need to send troops to Sardinia, but we must send a fleet to repel the Dionis who continue to harass Sardinia. Only the Asian fleet can ensure the safety of Sardinia. After defeating the Theonian fleet, we will transport some of our soldiers, as well as the Sardinian army, to Corsica to recapture Alenia. "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Many elders believe that what Taipanlaco said is reasonable, but some people have raised questions: "Our fleet has been destroyed by a storm before. I don't know how the new fleet that has been under construction is progressing? Is it ready to go to sea to fight?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I think this question should be answered more appropriately by our naval commander." Okriton looked at Annobas who was sitting at the back of the venue and said.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   These days, Annobas has been busy between the ports of the Phoenician allies in Africa. He received Hanno's message and rushed back to attend the Senate meeting. At this moment, he stood up and said loudly: " My Lords, since the Senate issued the decision in June that Carthage and its allies would go all out to build warships, all the shipyards in Carthage and the Phoenician city-states in Africa have been stepping up their efforts to build warships. What I have now The situation is that 195 three-layer oar warships have been built and are being equipped with crews and are preparing for trial sea trials."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "How long will it take to go to sea to fight?" A senator asked impatiently.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Generally speaking, it takes at least three months for a new fleet to have the ability to go to sea." When Annobas said this, he saw many elders in the scene showing disappointment, and a smile appeared on his lips: " But the current situation is quite special, because that storm destroyed our warships, but left behind a large number of experienced sailors. They only need 10 to 15 days to get familiar with the new ships, and then they can Form a fleet and go to sea to fight."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Great!" The senators looked happy, and some even shouted. During this period, due to the threat of Theonian warships in the northern seas, the Carthaginians were a little nervous even sailing out to sea. They also never I have never been so frustrated.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "15 days is too long. Our allies cannot wait that long. I suggest no more than 7 days at least! Within 7 days, please Lord Annobas to form a fleet as soon as possible, go to Sardinia, protect its waters, and attack Fight back the intrusion of Sardinia by the Theonian fleet, and then return to Lilibi to protect the safety of the shipping routes between Carthage and Sicily." Okriton asked with a serious expression: "Master Annobas, what can you do? Are you here?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, Okriton had already discussed it with Annobas in advance, and Annobus looked thoughtful. After a while, he solemnly nodded: "I will try my best to do it!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay, gentlemen, now let's reinforce Sardinia -" Before Okriton could finish his words, he was interrupted loudly by Preta Kuba: "Wait a minute! The newly established fleet is not It should be sent to Sardinia first, but to Sicily! Sardinia is guarded by more than 10,000 Phoenician soldiers. The Theonians only dare to harass, but do not dare to directly attack the city-states on the island. Their safety is actually guaranteed, and the situation is not as serious as they say.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And now the most important issue concerning the life and death of our Carthage is not Sardinia, but Sicily! The 100,000-strong army led by Lord Mago has already invaded Theonia's territory in Sicily and is engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy. But the problem now is that because we have no maritime advantage, military supplies and baggage can only be transported by land. , due to the long distance, uneven terrain, and the large amount of labor required, it not only increased the consumption of military rations, but was also attacked from the sea by the Theonian fleet several times.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Moreover, the main force of our army is far away in eastern Sicily, and the defense in the rear is relatively empty. The Theonian soldiers have taken boats to the west many times and landed on the beach to harass, threatening the security of our territory and allies in Sicily. They have already sent The messenger came here to ask for help, and why are we only discussing Sardinia today? ! I propose that the newly established fleet must be sent to the Sicilian waters immediately to regain our maritime superiority and ensure that the army led by Lord Mago can successfully drive the Theonians out of Sicily!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Due to Mago's achievements in Sicily, Preta Kuba was elected as a Sufit again this time, which also greatly increased the weight of his voice in the Senate. There was a lot of discussion in the venue for a while, but no one expressed any clear objection.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, Tepanlaco asked loudly: "If the new fleet is sent to Sicily, when will Sardinia's request for reinforcements be resolved?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Pretakouba glanced at him and said: "At least we have to wait until Lord Mago leads the army to drive the Theonians out of Sicily before we consider this issue."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Tai Panlaco sneered and said with a hint of ridicule: "Master Mago leads an army of 100,000 people, and is assisted by the people of Syracuse. So far, he has not been able to capture a small town in Theonia. Village, most of the soldiers are still blocked on the outskirts of the Catania plain. How long will it take for him to capture Catanai and Naxos? By then, I am afraid that all the mines in Sardinia will have become It's in ruins!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Pretakuba immediately retorted: "The reason why our army is attacking slowly now is precisely because the transportation of military supplies and baggage is holding it back, so it should be more..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Our fleet must go to Sardinia first!" A younger senator suddenly stood up and interrupted him loudly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Preta Kuba took a closer look and saw that it was El Akela, a new member of the neutral faction. His heart suddenly tightened and he suddenly felt a little uneasy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Lord Pretacuba, you have been emphasizing the importance of Sicily and requesting that the new fleet be launched in Sicily, but do you know how this fleet came about?!" El Acra waved his hands excitedly, Said: "A large amount of wood was cut from the Iberian Peninsula and transported by ship to the ports of Carthage and other Phoenician city-states. Then all shipyards were started and construction was stepped up. So many were built in just a few months. warship, do you know what the most important reason is?!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It's money! At the beginning, it was you who said at the Senate meeting, 'Although your Magonid family controls southern Iberia, we have to make some concessions to make the local indigenous people agree that we can safely cut down a large number of trees.' Finally, you convinced the Senate to pass the resolution. Carthage should allocate a portion of the treasury revenue every month to support Iberia in order to obtain ship lumber!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although our Carthage has a high prestige and all the Phoenician allies are very cooperative, is it free for those shipyard owners and craftsmen to stop other businesses and build warships for us every day? of course not! Even if they were willing, we Carthaginians would not ruin our credibility! We paid a lot of gold and silver to ensure the quality of the construction, and also to ensure that they would continue to build warships for us.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What about after the fleet is established? Hiring sailors costs money! Providing rations costs money! The food and equipment provided to the entire Carthaginian army required even more money! Lord Preeta Kuba, please tell me, where does this money come from? ! "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After hearing this, Preeta Kouba remained silent for the time being. As a senator of the Senate and a newly re-elected Sufit, of course he could not tell lies with open eyes and let others laugh.&#13;
