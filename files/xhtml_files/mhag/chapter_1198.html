   Chapter 1198 Rebuilding Sparta (1)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During this difficult period, a civil strife broke out in a town in the south. The king of the town led his people who were loyal to him to join Sparta. Sparta's strength was greatly improved. Strengthened, and with their help, they finally won the war in Laconia, thus establishing Sparta's leadership position in this region.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Lacedaemonians in the surrendered villages were called Pileasians (that is, border residents of the dominant city-state). They had personal freedom and the right to deal with local affairs, but they did not have it in the Spartan city-state. political rights, and were also placed under the supervision of military governors sent by Sparta to ensure that they could perform military service and cultivate royal estates.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even though the conquered village people were once compatriots, they were ruthlessly demoted into slaves. This was the original origin of the Helots.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   From this time on, Sparta established a dual-kingdom system (one was the king born in Sparta, from the Agidai clan; the other was the king from the south, from the Eulipontides clan).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now, Crotocactus wants to take advantage of this great opportunity to conquer Sparta, completely overturn Sparta's original political structure and establish a new political system.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He sent envoys to various Piliasian villages, invited them to come to Sparta, and promised them that Theonia would never do them any harm, but would give them the right to participate in the formation of A new Sparta.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition, he personally spoke to the captured Piliasian soldiers and then released them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, he also sent messengers to Messenia, recruiting a group of new Messenian citizens who were born as helots, and asked them to meet the helots hiding in the mountains, and use their own examples to persuade these fearful and fearful people. The starving helots came down from the mountain to cooperate with Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, Clotokatax did not talk to any Spartan.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just as he finished arranging these tasks and waited quietly for the arrival of the Pilians and Helots, he suddenly received a report from the garrison at the defense camp on the upper reaches of the Eurotas River: They had intercepted the attack from the north. Nearly a thousand Spartan soldiers came. When these soldiers learned that Sparta had been occupied, they surrendered without fighting. Among the captured soldiers was King Agesilaus of Sparta.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Crotocathax heard the news, he almost jumped up with excitement: the capture of Agesilaus and the army he led eliminated the last worry in his heart, and he could free his hands and feet to explore in this land. implement your own plans.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In order to prevent accidents, he also sent a heavy infantry brigade to escort these ten Spartan troops.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   One day later, Crotokatax saw these captives at the northern entrance to the city of Sparta. They were ragged, unkempt, and staggered as they walked, seemingly about to fall down at any time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotokatax now understood why the garrison company of the defensive camp could easily capture the defeated troops of nearly a thousand people with only 200 people.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He and the generals focused their attention on the leading Spartan: pale hair, beard, gray face, skinny as a stick, with his left leg curled up, holding a cane, hobbling forward with the help of others, Only those eyes seemed lively.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing Clotokatax and others in front of him, the old man pushed away the person who was supporting him and walked forward stubbornly and with difficulty.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Dear King Agesilaus!" Crotoka Tax did not assume the arrogant posture of a winner, but said in a gentle tone: "Hello! I am the commander of Theonia, Crotoka. Tuckers."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I know you...the son of Davos." Agesilaus seemed a little calm at the moment, and said in a hoarse voice: "This time we, Sparta, lost...I want to know you How to deal with... our Spartan people?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This last sentence was trembling in his voice, but it still revealed the worry in his heart.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There was a sarcastic smile on the corner of Crotokatax's mouth, and he said in a serious tone: "They have all been imprisoned. Many of them are still unwilling to accept the fact of defeat, and they seem to have dissatisfaction with the coalition forces led by you. Hope!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus was silent for a while, then looked directly at him and said in a deep and meaningful voice: "A defeat is a defeat. The city of Sparta has been occupied, what else is there to look forward to... ...But our Spartans have been very influential in the whole of Greece in the past few decades. Theonia wants to thwart the Persian conspiracy and dominate these city-states in Greece. We Spartans can still provide you with a lot of help! "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The old man who is known as "Sparta's toughest war fighter" actually showed his attitude of actively cooperating with him, which surprised Clotokatax. He calmed down and responded: "We The plan to deal with Sparta has been determined, and I believe you will know it soon. I hope you will lead the people to actively cooperate."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus looked at him deeply, and then looked back at him. The soldiers who passed by said: "Okay. But before that, I hope we can take a good bath and have a full meal."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Don't worry, we will make arrangements." Clotokatax looked a little bit Complex said: "I have good news to tell you. Your son Archidamus was injured and fled into the mountains. As a result, he fell into a coma because of the suppuration and infection of the wound. His guards carried him out of the mountains and surrendered to us. He is now in the process of carrying him out. He was treated by our doctors in the city of Tegea. He was not awake when I left, but his physical condition was much better than before."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Archidamus is the only son of Agesilaus and a direct bloodline of the Agidai royal family. Upon hearing this news, Agesilaus' heart dropped. He suppressed the excitement in his heart and said lightly: "It is the glory of Spartan warriors to die on the battlefield. Too many people have died in this war. Spartan warriors! But no matter what, thank you for your rescue. One more true Spartan is the only one!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotocathax stared at the retreating figure of Agesilaus. After a while, he turned around and said to Sekerian and others in a deep tone: "This Spartan king probably wandered around in the mountains for several days. He was so hungry that he finally came back and learned that It's really not easy for him to remain so calm despite the terrible news that Sparta was occupied! It's just... I hope he can remain so calm after learning about our plan to reorganize Sparta!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The hint of resentment in the tone of Clotokatax's words surprised Sekerian. Of course, he would not know that Clotokatax mainly blamed the Spartan commander Adoris for the death of Adoris. Gesilaus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Some of the helots who fled to the mountains followed the advice of the envoys from Messenia and returned to Sparta one after another. Sure enough, as the messenger said, the Theonian army not only did not arrest them, but instead arranged for them shelter, and food distributed, prompting more starving helots to run down the mountain.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After listening to the persuasion of the Theonian messenger, the people of various Piliasi villages sent their representatives one after another with doubts to come to Sparta to discuss matters.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A few days later, Crotokatax invited the representatives of Piliasis and the Helots into the Spartan meeting hall and asked them to sit on the wooden chairs where the Spartan elders sat. superior.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After everything was ready, Crotokatax stood at the front of the venue. Looking at the restless representatives, he said in a gentle tone: "Everyone, today is an important day for you. First of all, please Allow me to call you Lacedaemonians. Don't be surprised. Both you Pileasians and you Helots were once the same race as the Spartans. It was just a few hundred years ago that your Your ancestors suffered a defeat in the war against Sparta's unification of Lagnia. Not only did you lose your land and rights, you were also deprived of your true racial name. Those who surrendered became Pilians and were captured. Became a helot&#226;&#128;&#148;"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As Clotokatax said this, there was a great commotion in the venue.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the Piliasians have some inheritance, over the past few hundred years, the real history has become unclear. On the contrary, the Spartans have been deliberately promoting the theory that generations of Piliasians have The memory became clearer and clearer: they were immigrants from outside who, after reaching an agreement with the Spartans, were allowed to settle on the borders of this land.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The situation of the Helots was even worse. They had been slaves for generations, and the Spartans would never let them read or write. Therefore, most of them were illiterate and spent their entire lives under the stick education of the Spartans. They all have to work hard to serve the Spartans. They don't know the history of their own race, and they don't even know the names of their parents. They live numbly and have no hope...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But today, someone suddenly told them: "You and the Spartans Like masters, they were all once the masters of this land!" This completely subverted their previous understanding, and they were all shocked as never before.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   They talked to each other suspiciously, and even dared to ask Clotokatax.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "We Theonian scholars have studied the history of Sparta and have obtained some very precious information, which can completely prove that you were all Lacedaemonians. If you want to see it, wait for the Greeks in the future. When the situation stabilizes, I will invite you to the library of Thurii to read these treasures. What&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I want to tell you now is that the reason why the Theonian army captured Messenia was to let the Spartans who were once greatly The enslaved Messenians regained their independence. You have communicated with them before. It should be clear that we Theonia have already done what we said.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now one of the important reasons for Theonia's capture of Sparta is to make it double now. You who are enslaved regain your lost land and rights and become the true masters of Lagnia!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
