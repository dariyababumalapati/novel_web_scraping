   Chapter 1271 Racing Competition (4)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Immediately afterwards, Procris felt his racing car being thrown out suddenly, and heard a "bang!" sound. The violent vibration almost caused him to fall off the racing car, but fortunately he tightened his grip on it. Reins.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But next to him came the continuous curses of the Gauls. It turned out that his racing car collided with the opponent's.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The contestants all wanted to regain the leading position when turning, and accelerated their horses one after another in an attempt to overtake from the outside. Eight vehicles in the traffic jam were almost squeezed together, and many collisions occurred.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Such an exciting scene aroused exclamations from the audience, and at the same time aroused their greater enthusiasm for watching the game, and the cheers became louder and louder.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Unlike an epic movie from a previous life, where saw teeth were installed on the wheel axles of the racing cars, which could destroy other players' cars, it is impossible to allow such cheating in the racing competitions of the Greek Games. The participating cars must undergo strict inspections before they are allowed. Entering the field, this is especially true for the Theonian Games. Once discovered, bad behavior such as hitting an opponent with a riding crop will only be ejected.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, this time the collision between the cars did not result in a car crash or death, but it did affect the speed of the cars.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just as Procris' car slowed down due to the collision, another car quickly passed from the outside and rushed to the front.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The car was shining with gold, the driver had dark skin, and his clothes were also shining with gold, and the four black horses were equipped with gorgeous headdresses, making the whole car look magnificent.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It turned out that this was a driver from Egypt. He was not a slave or a freedman like the Greek drivers, but a small Egyptian nobleman who drove specifically for the Pharaoh's heir Jie Hao.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The reason why Jhe sent him to compete was, on the one hand, to please Theonia, and on the other hand, to show Egypt's capabilities and image to Theonia and other Mediterranean city-states.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It was just that by the start of the race, the Egyptian envoy delegation led by Jah had still not reached Thurii, which disappointed the Egyptian driver, but this did not affect his state in the race. Although he fell behind at the start, he was not too Anxious, instead of accelerating to grab the lane like other players, he calmly drove the car around to the outside. With his superb driving skills, not only did he not waste time due to multiple detours, but he also used other cars to collide with each other and become crowded. When I arrived, I quickly rushed to the front.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing this situation, the Gallic driver became anxious and whipped his horse, trying to make the car catch up. As a result, he collided with the car on the outside again, making the Bruti driver cursed in anger.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Procris was still calm. He did not wave the whip, but shook the reins lightly, whistled at the same time, and shouted: "Efila! Run, run!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   According to Coach Procris, "In Incorporating mares into the horses pulling the racing car may be slightly slower, but it can ensure the stability of the racing car. At the same time, it can stimulate competition between the male horses and speed up the horse at critical times." Prock Reese accepted his suggestion and found that the effect was very good during the training, and even later the mare named Efila became the stabilizer of the entire racing car.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, the smart young mare seemed to understand what her owner meant. She neighed a few times and hoofed forward directly. The three young stallions also worked hard next to her. Procris's racing car accelerated instantly. After breaking away from the crowded racing pile, if the horse's running was slightly deviated at that time, it might run into the anxious Gallic racing car next to it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a while, the racing cars on the field were divided into different levels again. The Egyptian racing car charged forward, Procris followed closely behind, Gaul, Bruti, and Thebes kept pace with each other, and Cyrenaica and West Numbia were slightly behind. Falling behind... Everyone is chasing after each other, each showing his own talents, stirring up clouds of dust and mist, and the scene is very intense.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The cheers of the audience also continued to be enthusiastic.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Theonian engineers used a mixture of fine sand and fine clay to lay the track, it was still impossible to avoid the dust. Procris followed closely behind the Egyptian racing car and naturally tasted the pain of eating dust.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Through the mist of dust, he saw the staff on the central ridge platform picking up an iron hook and hooking one of the rows of tall silver dolphin statues. He felt a slight movement in his heart: It has already been completed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He immediately concentrated, because in front of these dolphins was another stone pillar that should turn.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He saw the Egyptian racing car in front of him clinging to the centerline, obviously intending to defend the inner circle. He turned around and looked to the side, but no racing car was catching up, so he pulled the reins to the outside without hesitation and blew a whistle at the same time. whistled sharply.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The four horses immediately rushed towards the outer circle, still maintaining high speed when turning. Due to inertia, Procris's racing car once again swung outwards, and also tilted to the right, and was about to capsize.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Nearby spectators let out worried cries.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, Procris did not panic. He held on to the reins, stood firm on his legs, and controlled his center of gravity.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The left wheel of the car was in the air, and after rolling only on the right wheel for a moment, the left wheel landed safely again...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Dionyian audience breathed a huge sigh of relief, and then the entire audience gave thunderous cheers for Procris' wonderful performance.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is the fast cornering technique that Procris has developed in the past two years. Successfully displaying it in a real competition also doubled his confidence. He shouted excitedly: "Well done, Efila! Well done. Boys!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The four horses responded with a high-pitched neigh, and their running hooves became more powerful, dragging the racing car and catching up.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the Egyptian driver saw Procris who had caught up to him, he felt a little nervous. He immediately waved his riding whip and shouted: "Frame! frame!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The riders all learned their lesson and tried to pull away as much as possible when turning. interval, but tragedy still happened.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Macedonian driver who was lagging behind was eager to catch up and maintained high speed when turning. However, he did not have the superb driving skills of Procris. After another collision with the West Numibian car in front, the car overturned and the driver was thrown away. Fly out...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   the audience exclaimed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The ambulance crew immediately rushed to the scene of the accident, lifted the injured driver on a stretcher, and pulled the car to the exit of the venue. Fortunately, the Macedonian racing car was the last one, so all the cleanup work was relatively quick and did not affect the progress of the race.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The doctor arrived quickly and carefully examined the driver's injuries. He found that apart from a dislocated arm, a head concussion, and some fainting, he had no external injuries. He was lucky.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is of course also related to the fact that the Theonia Games have taken some safety measures in racing competitions: The Theonia Games racing referee team requires drivers to wear helmets with soft cotton linings, thick leather jackets and leather trousers, and even less Starting gate to avoid collisions due to too many cars during the race... But even so, accidents still happen, and racing is indeed the most dangerous event in the sports games.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Shame, this is simply a shame for Macedonia!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ... Prince Philip of Macedonia, who was at the VIP table, was furious.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Macedonian envoy next to him comforted him and said: "There is no need for you to be angry. Although we in Macedonia are rich in horses, people love to ride horses and few people drive. And they have never participated in any racing competitions before (the Greek city-states regard Macedonia as barbarians, and they are not allowed to drive)." Allowing them to participate in various sports games in Greece), they have no racing experience at all. They only signed up to participate in this project because of Theonia's kindness. It is inevitable to encounter such a failure."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Fili obviously could not accept this statement, He said with a stern look: "Since you have participated in the competition, you must have the ambition to win the championship! If you don't have experience, you can learn from experienced people, and seize the time to train! Theonia sent an invitation letter a year ago, and What has he been doing for more than a year? His performance on the court was so poor that the audiences from all over the world looked down upon us. How can this be accepted?" The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Macedonian envoy was a little embarrassed. He lowered his face and simply ignored Fei. Li, staring straight at the arena, thinking: Although you are a prince, you do not have any rights. You have caused me a lot of trouble by coming to Theonia without authorization. Now you are actually yelling at me. It is simply Don't know what is good and what is bad!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The disdainful attitude of the Macedonian envoy made Philip grit his teeth. Although he was young, he was already relatively familiar with world affairs, and he understood very well why the other party dared to do this. Not only because he was insignificant in Macedonia, but also because his brother, King Bodi of Macedonia, Kass also does not have much influence in the country. Most of the power is controlled by Ptolemy and several other ministers. He even doubts: Without the support of Theonia, the shameless man who declared to the outside world "is Bo Dychus and his stepfather Ptolemy had long since usurped the throne.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The domestic royal power declined, and externally Macedonia was regarded as a poor and backward country in the eyes of many city-states and countries. Compared with its neighboring Theionian Kingdom of Thessaly, it was completely different.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The reason why Fili secretly came to Theonia was not to watch the sports meeting, but to seriously explore and understand how Theonia became such a powerful city from a small city-state in just twenty or thirty years. The real reason for the kingdom, but the population of Thurii is so huge that he is just a drop in the ocean, and no one cares about it. He is shocked by the prosperity of this huge city, but he lacks administrative experience and cannot see through it. This prosperity, seeing the real secret that can lead to this prosperity.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He sometimes couldn't help but feel frustrated: Will the Macedonian royal family always be under the protection of Theonia?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Will Macedonia never be able to create miracles like Theonia?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The competition is still going on fiercely, with two laps, three laps, four laps... The top two are always Egypt and In Turui's car, the two drivers were locked on each other, and the difference between them was only one horse length at most.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But the third to fifth positions were constantly changing, sometimes Gaul, sometimes Bruti, sometimes Corinth... You were chasing each other, it was so lively, and it aroused bursts of cheers from the audience outside the stadium.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
