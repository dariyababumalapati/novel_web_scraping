   Chapter 1314: Battle of Taposacus (6)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Let go!" At the command of the team officers, the Balearic soldiers took advantage of the situation and threw Sonnet's lead shot with all their strength.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Immediately afterwards, they put the smallest type of lead shot (according to many tests by the Ministry of Military Affairs, an excellent Balearic slinger can throw this type of lead shot about 400 meters away) into the rope pocket, and then Swing the sling once, throw the lead shot again, and so on without stopping.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even if a lead shot the size of a red date hits a person, it cannot cause much damage. However, when such a lead shot falls from mid-air, it causes a lot of trouble to the Persian mixed cavalry who are speeding up. Whether it hits the cavalry or falls on the horse, it is easy for the cavalry to fall over, or even die tragically under the hooves of the cavalry at the rear. Especially after the camel cavalry running in the front is hit by lead shot and overturned, its huge The size also becomes a major obstacle, tripping up teammates who cannot dodge behind him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Persian mixed troops on both wings were originally in a loose formation, but after the attack, the formation became even more loose. Each had a line two miles long and nearly one mile thick. 4,000 lead pellets were scattered. In fact, it did not cause much damage to the entire Persian cavalry. Heavy casualties, but it kept falling like hail. From 450 meters to 150 meters, the Balearic slingers actually threw 5 rounds, continuously causing damage to the Persian cavalry, which not only made the Persian cavalry formation more The sparseness also forced their overall advance to slow down and their morale to decrease.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "150 meters! 150 meters!..." When the observer's voice reached the light infantry in front of the slingers, nearly 10,000 archers on both sides of the entire army formation in Theonia shot the arrows in their hands almost simultaneously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, Kuchius said loudly: "It's time to look at our cavalry next!" When the&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   flag bearer next to him heard this, he immediately waved the fluttering military flag and pointed forward vigorously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Theonian cavalry drove their horses and began to jog forward.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Theonian cavalry formation is exactly the opposite of the Persian mixed cavalry. The horses are very close to each other, and the formation has only two rows, so its length is nearly two miles.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After receiving the order to attack, the Numibian light cavalry, which was originally in a loose formation behind them, quickly moved to the outermost side with bows and javelins in hand, revealing the thousands of light armored soldiers hiding behind them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   These lightly armored soldiers were armed with leather shields and daggers, and they quickly followed the cavalry regiment in front.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In order to avoid accidentally injuring their own cavalry, the Theonian archers on both wings only fired two rounds. However, because their number was more than three times that of the slingers, and the lethality of bows and arrows was greater than that of lead shot, they were unable to kill the Persian cavalry. Bigger too.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The smug Mardonios did not expect that the cunning Theonians actually ambushed the light infantry behind the cavalry. Since he led the cavalry and started to advance, there was first a non-stop rain of stones in the air, and then the sky was covered. The sun-blocking arrows were shot, and the cavalry guards that originally clustered around him gradually became sparse. Even he himself was hit by an arrow. Fortunately, his thick scales blocked it, preventing him from causing fatal damage.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   With lingering fear, he desperately accelerated his horse, with only one thought in his mind: to engage the Theonian cavalry as soon as possible, defeat them, and everything would be safe!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, when he saw the Theonian cavalry approaching, he was suddenly stunned: the Theonian cavalry stood next to each other, like a long, fast-moving wall, which he had never seen in his decades of military career. After such a cavalry charge.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, there are occasional wall charge trainings like this in the military training of Theonia, but this is the first time it is used in actual combat, and it is in such an important battle, so Kuchius, who leads the cavalry, My palms were all sweaty.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The young cavalrymen of Theonia didn't think so much. They held a spear in one hand and pulled the reins in the other. They leaned forward and kept putting pressure on the war horses with their legs: "Drive! Drive!..." The sharply soaring speed of the war horses made Their blood was boiling, and the close proximity of their comrades made them feel at ease, so they were fearless in the face of the approaching enemy cavalry.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the short distance of a hundred meters, the sharp increase in horse speed made it difficult for the Theonia cavalry's formation to remain compact, but the two armies were already close.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In an instant, the cavalry collided, blood spattered, spears broke, soldiers fell to the ground, and war horses screamed... The curvy cavalry line of Theonia ceased to exist in the blink of an eye, but at the same time, the momentum of the Persian cavalry's furious advance was also affected. Without containment, the cavalry battlefield basically came to a standstill.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mardonios, who fell from his horse, staggered to his feet with the support of his guards. He drew out the sword from his waist and was about to lead his guards to kill the enemy who also fell from his horse. Then he was horrified to see countless black-helmeted and black soldiers. A. Theonian soldiers holding leather shields and daggers poured out from the gaps between the cavalry and came towards them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The cunning Theonians actually hid the infantry behind the cavalry!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ...Seeing this situation, Mardonios' whole body trembled and his mind went blank.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Sir, let's go!" The guards hurriedly picked up Mardonios on their backs and fled back in a hurry.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   How could the Persian cavalry, which had lost its speed advantage, be an opponent of the well-trained Theonian light armor in close combat? The Persian light cavalry that did not participate in the charge, such as the Scythian cavalry, were severely damaged by the Numibian light armor. The cavalry was restrained and unable to provide support. The Persian mixed cavalry was completely at a disadvantage under the attack of the Theonian light armor. This is exactly what Davos asked the Theonian cavalry regiment to adopt this dense linear array attack. The reason is.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing the enemy approaching cautiously with a buckler and a bayonet on the opposite side, Alsinis knew that this was the commander of the legion. Mentioned of Greek soldiers employed by Persia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Traitor!" He spit out contemptuously, and then shouted: "Javelin!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The soldiers who had been prepared threw the only remaining javelin with all their strength.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This did not cause any damage to the prepared Greek mercenaries, but it caused them to stop temporarily.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Charge!" Alsinis shouted again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Hades!!!" the soldiers roared in unison and rushed towards the enemy 30 meters away.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The infantry of both sides began to fight on the long front of more than ten miles in the center, on the left wing, and on the right wing. The battle finally began in full swing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even though the Theonian army has a lot of advantages in close combat, the infantry confrontation cannot be determined in a short time, not to mention that the Persians are well aware of the weaknesses of their own army, and have made some changes to this. In addition to The Greek mercenaries and the undead army, who were not weak in close combat, also equipped the sturdy mountain races such as Kaldan and Dukiya with iron helmets, chain armor, copper shields and one-handed hammers, hoping that they could Fight against the legionnaires of Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Unfortunately, not long after the battle began, the soldiers of the Duyaxokant tribe suddenly retreated under the command of the chief leader Remi and the leaders. At the same time, they shouted loudly: "We are defeated, we are defeated!!... &#226;&#128;&#166;"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Persian general who was responsible for supervising the troops at the back was panicked by this change, and even tried to send the law enforcement team beside him to kill the Dukiya soldiers who took the lead in escaping, so as to force them to stop escaping and return to fight.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, the soldiers of the Xokant tribe were well prepared to retreat. How could the law enforcement team withstand the attack of thousands of Dukiya soldiers? They were all quickly defeated, and even the Persian general was chopped down.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The retreat of the Xokant troops caused a gap of nearly 200 meters suddenly appeared on the right-wing infantry front of the Persian army. The soldiers of the Eleventh Theonian Legion fighting with them closely followed the Dukiya soldiers and poured into the gap, and Under the command of the team officers, move forward quickly instead of immediately starting to attack the enemies on both sides of the gap, so that the 18th and 19th Corps as reserves behind them can continue to pour into the gap.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The sudden retreat of the Xokant tribe warriors also seriously affected the Dukiya warriors on both sides, especially when they saw a steady stream of Theonian soldiers rushing through the gap and appearing behind them. You can imagine the panic in their hearts. As you know, fighting spirit is declining sharply.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not far behind the array formed by the Dukiya warriors were Persian archers. They followed their own infantry array. They were originally preparing to use the few remaining arrows to attack the rear of the Theonian infantry array from a distance, providing a way for the troops in front. Providing support is a traditional tactic of the Persian army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now, everyone was shocked to see that the Dukiya warriors in front were defeated as soon as they engaged in battle, and even attacked and killed the supervising team.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this critical moment, the commander of this archery unit resolutely ordered the archers to draw their daggers and step forward to meet the enemy to block the gap and prevent the collapse of the front.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Letting the light infantry carry the Dukiya warriors and Theonian legionnaires equipped with sophisticated weapons head-on was simply a joke with their lives, but the archers showed the blood of the Persians at this time, and they came from all around. They gathered together and started a fierce battle with the enemy in an attempt to maintain the front. At the same time, they also sent messengers to rush back to the formation to ask for reinforcements.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Artaxerxes turned pale with fear when he learned of the dire situation on the right wing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Trebasus, now we... what should we do?" He asked his most trusted adviser in panic.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Trebassus was also panicked, but he forced himself to calm down: "Your Majesty... the archers led by General Arteus can't resist the enemy for long. We must let the reserve troops press forward as soon as possible! We have strong troops, as long as we can re-solidify Du The advantage of the Keans' front is still on our side!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Artaxerxes regained some confidence after what he said. Not only did he immediately issue the order, but he also cursed: "The cursed Doukeans , How could I have believed in these shameless villains before? When I win the battle, I must completely eliminate them!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166; &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, the Persian reserve force has moved!" Felicius, who received the news, reported to Davos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as he finished speaking, Tormid shouted excitedly: "Look! The King of Persia is coming up too!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
