   Chapter 1122 Theonia's counterattack plan&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos touched the stubble on his chin, and his face finally showed a bit of joy. He looked around everyone, and his eyes finally fell on Alexis: "The Gauls are coming fiercely. I originally thought that this sudden war would last for a relatively long time, and I asked everyone to formulate a careful counterattack plan... Alas, I didn't expect that the Gauls were so careless, and all our preparations were in vain. You guys Do you have any new opinions on the current war situation?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty." Alexis and Printors looked at each other and said, "Before coming to the palace, I had already discussed the current situation with Mr. Printors. The battle situation in Trulia was briefly discussed. Patroclus led the northern coalition to defeat the main force of the Gauls. Next, he will inevitably launch a further continuous attack on the remaining Gaulish army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And we believe that the three border legions It is impossible for a military camp to be captured by the Gauls in such a short period of time. The Gauls most likely only used a small number of troops to keep an eye on the military camp, and the larger troops directly bypassed it and invaded the Etruscan territory-"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "No need to speculate. I already have definite information, at least the military camp where Hasdrubal is still defending tenaciously and has not fallen." Davos said confidently.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alexis was not surprised. He knew that the intelligence department under King Davos was powerful. After thinking about it, he took the opportunity to say: "Your Majesty, can you send someone to inform Lord Hasdrubal to cooperate with the northern coalition forces?" Attack, block the mountain passes leading to the Po River plain, intercept the Gauls who want to escape back to their territory with all their strength, and completely surround and eliminate them south of the mountains!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos said without hesitation: "I We will send someone to give orders to Hasdrubal, but I think even if we cannot notify Hasdrubal in time, with his ability, he will be able to make corresponding decisions based on the changes in the battle situation." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Your Majesty." Pu Lin Tols took over and said loudly: "The reason why we want to wipe out all the invading Gauls south of the mountains is because we think the Gauls are a very aggressive race and have a large population. , the threat is also great. It has only been sixteen years since the last large-scale invasion, and we can dispatch far more than 50,000 troops. If we always adopt a defensive strategy, not only will we be too passive, but the Gauls will also Learn a lesson from this disastrous defeat. Next time they go south in a big way, they may cause us more trouble. Therefore, to completely solve the Gauls' problem, we should take advantage of the fact that the Gauls' strength has been hit hard this time. This is a great opportunity to change from defense to offense, directly send troops to attack the Gauls' territory, and completely conquer them!" As soon as&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   these words came out, there was a small commotion in the conference hall, and several rotating chairs began to whisper to each other.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The corners of Davos' mouth curled up slightly. Printors' suggestion was exactly what he wanted. He glanced at the rotating chairs who were whispering, and asked calmly: "Well...take the initiative, do you have anything concrete?" Plan?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alexis walked to the wooden map of northern Italy placed in the center of the chamber and said in a deep voice: "According to current intelligence, the Gauls who invaded Etrunia this time were led by Senones. It is estimated that most of the young and middle-aged warriors of these two Gallic tribes have joined this invading army, which is why there is such a huge number. Therefore, their territory must be defenseless due to insufficient troops.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now, soldiers from the First, Second, Fourth, and Third Corps have gathered together. They were originally planning to reinforce the northern coalition, but now it seems that they are no longer needed. It is better to transfer these legions to Brindi. West, take a boat to the north and land near Ariminum (now Rimini)." Alexis pointed to a location on the map and said in a sonorous voice: "Directly attack the Gauls' territory. !"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, Davos and others had already gathered in front of the map, focusing on the landing place Alexis mentioned.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Looking at the map carefully, other ministers realized that it was not that easy to directly attack the Gauls' territory.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Gauls rely on the tall and steep Alps to the north, to the west is the territory of the Ligurians, and to the east is the territory of the Venetians. The coast is almost entirely occupied by these two races. The Gauls are Caught in the middle.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although it is the territory of the Etruscans to the south, there are continuous mountains between the two. The direct distance is more than a hundred miles, and many areas in it are difficult to pass, and the places with lower terrain are often It was settled by Gallic tribes (mainly the Senones).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   If the Theonian army wants to attack the Gaulish territory through the mountains, it can certainly be done in the current situation where the Gaulish army has suffered heavy losses, but it is unfamiliar with the terrain, has difficulty in transportation, and has an overall disadvantage compared to the Gauls. The ability to fight in the mountains is weak...etc. These shortcomings will not only cause greater losses to the Theonian army, but also slow the movement, causing the Gauls in the Po River plain to have enough time to prepare for defense in advance, which will reduce the effectiveness of the attack. If it is greatly reduced, the war will continue to be prolonged... Therefore, the Ministry of Military Affairs analyzed that this is not a good choice.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Ligurians and Venetians are two conservative races who have not had much contact with Theonia in the past. It is estimated that even the Theonia envoy assured them that the Theonia army was only to attack Gaul. People will never infringe on their interests, nor will they allow a strange and powerful army to land on their own coast and cross their territory.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And if the Theonian army wants to forcefully land on their coast, it will undoubtedly trigger a new war, which is certainly not a wise move.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, it seems that the best and only place to launch an attack first is Arimium.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Because this is the only seaside town of the Gauls, it is to the south of the Veneti territory, to the north of the Apennine Mountains, and on the edge of the Adriatic Sea.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Alimium..." Davos stared at its icon, recalling the information about it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He had a lot of affairs in the past few years, and attacking the Gallic territory was not in his plan. He didn't pay too much attention to the details of the Gallic territory, so he didn't have many memories about him in his mind, so he simply asked He said: "Is the coast there easy to land on? What is the situation at Arimium? Is the defense tight?..." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Your Majesty." Printols explained in detail: "Arimium was originally a Venetian people The town was captured by the Senones more than 20 years ago. At first, they seemed to have only taken a fancy to the flat land around Alimium, using it to cultivate farmland and graze cattle and sheep. It is said that until the pirate adventures in the Adriatic Sea Landing in this small town, he proposed to trade with the Gauls, and successfully exchanged some stolen goods for horses from the Senones. Only then did the Senones realize the benefits of sea trade, so this Over the past 10 years, the Thelonians began to develop maritime trade in the city of Alimium. They expanded the city and built markets and ports in the city. The Senones' maritime trade gradually made some progress, but they lacked sailors. , mainly relying on merchants from other city-states to trade in the city of Alimium.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, the Gauls have a bad reputation, and because they have just begun to develop, there are not many merchants willing to trade in the city of Alimium, mainly Adri. Pirates from the Asia Sea, or some merchants from the opposite Illyrian region, and occasionally Umbrians and Florentani people came to exchange goods in small boats.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the patrol ship of the 1st Fleet was cruising in the Adriatic Sea, it carefully observed Arimium. The report said that its walls were low and made of wood, and the city area was not large. It was not so much a city. It is better to say that it is a Gallic camp, and the security in the city is relaxed. The coast where it is located has many flat beaches, which can accommodate hundreds of ships landing at the same time..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos listened carefully while listening , while staring closely at the tentacles of the Gauls' territory extending to the southeast on the map. That small area was an attempt by the Gauls who had lived inland for many years to move towards the ocean, but now Dio Nia was about to interrupt their vision and vision of the ocean.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked back at the rotating presidents and asked: "What do you think of the recommendations of the Ministry of Military Affairs?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although he saw the excitement flashing in Davos's eyes, Lysias still had to remind him: "Your Majesty, now we all know that there are three tribes of Gauls south of the Alps. During this invasion, The Mesocenones and Cnomannis had suffered heavy losses, and their territories may have been defenseless, but what about Sarvis?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   They did not participate in this invasion.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Moreover, according to the intelligence of the Gauls, this tribe has been developing with peace of mind and rarely carried out external expansion, but its strength is the strongest among the three tribes. Once our army attacks the territory of their compatriots, Sarvis will I am afraid that people will fully assist its defense, and this war may not end so easily.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos pondered, but had not yet responded.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But Antaoris laughed and said loudly: "It is not a bad thing that the Sarvis people want to join this war. It is just an excuse to completely destroy it. The conquest would have settled all the Gauls south of the Alps at once.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Lord Lysias feels that the war will become difficult with the addition of the Sarvis. That is because before we only prepared to send the first, third, fourth and fifth legions. With the kingdom now full With the treasury and sufficient granaries, we can send a few more legions to defeat all the Gauls in a short time with absolute advantage!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After hearing this, Davos's eyes lit up and he cast an approving look at Antaoris.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
