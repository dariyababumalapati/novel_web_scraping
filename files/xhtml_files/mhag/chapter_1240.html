   Chapter 1240: Ministry of Commerce's Requests&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "He will come, he promised me!" Theos said firmly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   No wonder you talked about this with me when you came... Saustatus thought to himself and said: "That would be great. With your help, we will solve this problem today."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Theo Si nodded, and then changed the topic: "Before anyone else comes, let's discuss how to get your brother to get the support of the Ministry of Military Affairs."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sostatus now understands: why Theos is here The reason for mentioning his brother before was that he wanted to give him some benefits in advance so that he could make some concessions in the subsequent negotiations with Dickpolis. Of course, he would not refuse.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not long after, the slave merchant Sebernus, the wine merchant Kalmandes, and the shipbuilder Mikris , the wool textile merchant Pholasias, the medicine merchant Agumus, the stone merchant Inipias... all came one after another, including of course Dickpolis. Although he had a straight face, at least he did not follow him on the spot. Saustatus was noisy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Moreover, Theos quickly pulled him to sit down at the dining table very close to him. After whispering to him for a while, his face became better, and he looked at the guest who greeted the guests at the door of the hall with a complicated expression. Saustatus didn't know what he was thinking.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After all the invited guests arrived, Saustatus immediately ordered the servants to bring all the prepared dishes to the table, and asked the maids to pour wine for each guest.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then he raised his glass and said loudly: "Everyone, it has been a long time since our chamber of commerce got together like today. Thank you very much for taking the time to come to the banquet tonight. I would like to toast you to this first glass of wine!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After saying that, he drank it all in one gulp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "That's because you, the president, usually hold too few banquets. Otherwise, if you had spoken, how could we not attend?" Kalmandes joked while raising his glass: "In any case, I thank the president for serving us. I'll give you a drink in return for this banquet!" After saying that, he drank it all in one gulp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as he started, others followed suit and the atmosphere of the banquet became lively.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Dickpolis saw this, picked up the wine glass and took a sip silently. He understood why Kalmandes was so interested in helping Sostatus to liven up the atmosphere of the banquet, because Sostatus had helped Kalmandes in the past few years. His wine opened up sales in mainland Greece and the Aegean Sea, greatly increasing his income. The goods of other merchants at the banquet also received more or less help from Sostatus and entered the mainland Greek market, including him. I, it was just because of the Athenian pottery incident that the relationship between the two was at loggerheads, but if the root cause of this matter was the instruction of His Majesty the King... it was indeed a big trouble, and it seemed that I had to talk to Sostatus carefully. Let's talk!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thinking of this, he stood up: "Sostatus, I would like to toast you too. Thank you for providing a lot of help to us in the Chamber of Commerce in the past few years!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as he spoke, the hall suddenly became quiet, and everyone All eyes were focused on the two of them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sostatus picked up the wine glass without hesitation and said with a calm smile: "Without the support of you, the former president, I, Sostatus, would not be where I am today! For the better development of the Chamber of Commerce, I also wish everyone here Your business will be more prosperous, you and I have a drink!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Both of them drank it down in one gulp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay! Great!!" Others shouted in unison, and Theos also smiled happily. They all saw that the two of them had settled their differences, and they all drank to cheer.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Everyone, don't just sit around drinking. Hurry up and eat some food first. Let's chat while eating." Saustatus said in a happy mood after the conflict was temporarily resolved.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "President, yesterday the Ministry of Commerce convened a meeting with the presidents of chambers of commerce in various towns. Today you invite everyone to the banquet. Is there anything important you want to tell us? Why don't you say it first so that we don't worry about it in our hearts? , Drinking and eating are not fun!" Cerberus said bluntly, and others followed suit.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Saustatus pointed at him pretending to be helpless: "You are too impatient to wait for this little time. Well, I will tell you first."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He stood up, looked around at everyone, and said loudly: " I believe you all have guessed that this time the Ministry of Commerce convened various chambers of commerce to discuss 'about the upcoming Theonia Games'. Yes, it is indeed the case! Since His Majesty announced that he would be in Turi two years ago After Yi held the Theonia Games, the Ministry of Finance spent a lot of gold and silver to prepare for the games, and also set up high bonuses for various competitive sports in the games. This caused a sensation among the people of the entire kingdom and its affiliated allies. The kingdom Athletes from all regions and allied countries are actively signing up, and a large number of spectators are pouring into Turiyi to watch the competition...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   We all know that the sports meeting is not only a festival for gods, athletes and spectators, but also a festival for our businessmen. Festival, the 103rd Olympia Games two years ago was the first time the Kingdom sent athletes to participate. We also went to join in the fun. During the games, tens of thousands of spectators from all over the world gathered in Olympia. Shops were set up in Olympia and surrounding towns. They all made huge profits as a result.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, even though the kingdom has become the leader of the Greek Union, the traditional ideas of the Greek native people are still deeply rooted. Theonian athletes suffered discrimination and ridicule in Olympia, and we Theonian businessmen We have also been squeezed out, and no matter how much money we spend, we can't even buy a storefront for us to set up a stall for sales..." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The president is right, the damn Greek businessmen actually dare to use those despicable methods against us! This is Once, during the Theonian Games, I will let them know how powerful the Theonian merchants are!" Sebernus shouted angrily.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "That's right, President, we should take advantage of this sports meeting to show these ignorant Greek businessmen the powerful power of our Thurii Chamber of Commerce!" Sebernus's words immediately resonated with some people.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sostatus smiled and did not respond directly, but continued: "Maybe it was because of what we Theonians experienced at the Olympia Games that His Majesty Davos decided to hold the largest sports meeting. , while demonstrating the strength of the country, it also contrasted with the narrow-mindedness and selfishness of the Greeks, and demonstrated the tolerance and broadness of the kingdom. Therefore, the Minister of Commerce Mariji told us that in fact, the kingdom not only sent an invitation to the allies, but also notified all the Mediterranean countries. The country, even Persia, the kingdom's enemy&#226;&#128;&#148;"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There was a commotion in the hall.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The reason why the Ministry of Commerce convened this meeting is to ask us businessmen from the kingdom not to participate in this Games with a narrow vindictive mentality, but to welcome businessmen from all countries with a tolerant attitude. Only in this way will the Theonia Games be held Only then will our trade become more and more prosperous, and we will earn more and more gold and silver, so that the Theonian Games can become the most famous great Games in the entire Mediterranean, and everyone will actively participate in it!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this point, Sostatus emphasized his tone: "After the meeting, Mr. Mariji specially stayed with me for discussion and asked me to warn all the businessmen in the Turiyi Chamber of Commerce after I come back. During this period, the interests of foreign businessmen must not be squeezed out, harassed, or violated; illegal means must not be used to obtain certain privileges, thereby undermining the fairness of commercial activities during the Games... Moreover, as one of the hosts of the Games, the Thurii Chamber of Commerce must be proactive Assist the Ministry of Commerce in maintaining the normal operation of all trade markets in the entire Turiyi region...'&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mr. Malijie also conveyed to you an order personally issued by His Majesty Davos, 'If during the games, the Ministry of Commerce discovers that the Kingdom's merchants, especially If merchants from the Turiyi Chamber of Commerce violate the above requirements, no matter who they are, they will be severely punished!'" As&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   soon as he finished speaking, the hall suddenly became silent.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a while, Dickpolis couldn't help but asked first: "Listen to what you said, our Turiyi Chamber of Commerce has no right to enter the four urban trade markets temporarily opened for this sports meeting?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He asked The issue is also the issue that everyone is most concerned about, because on the day when the Ministry of Commerce announced the "opening of temporary markets", almost everyone present was using their own networks in an attempt to obtain the best location and largest area of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;the store in each market. Even more is better.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Of course not." Saustatus said seriously: "I also asked this question to Mr. Mariji, and he told me, 'All domestic businessmen and foreign businessmen who apply to enter these markets will be treated equally, and he will personally Responsible for arranging distribution, trying to ensure that every businessman participating in the sports meeting can obtain a more ideal store, and the distribution plan will eventually be submitted to His Majesty for review...'&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And Mr. Mariji also quietly told me, 'His Majesty appointed the Intelligence Department to secretly Investigate illegal activities during the sports games. Once discovered, both parties involved will be severely punished.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   'So don't take any chances, otherwise you will harm others and yourself.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sostatus' words made everyone feel nervous. They all looked at each other and were thinking silently.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Theos couldn't help but said: "Isn't it fair competition? There is nothing to worry about!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Our Turiyi Chamber of Commerce is the largest chamber of commerce in the kingdom, and you are also among the top businessmen in a certain industry in the kingdom. In terms of financial resources, manpower, and the quality and quantity of goods, you are better than merchants in other parts of the kingdom, let alone those Businessmen from small towns in Greece, and you also occupy a favorable location. In the case of fair competition, can't you still defeat them?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
