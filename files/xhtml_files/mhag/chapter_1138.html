   Chapter 1138 The resolution to declare war on Sparta (1)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos asked Henepolis to make multiple copies of the war report and distribute it to the ministers, and then said: "Everyone, as we expected, Kallias Not long after the contract was signed, the war between Sparta and Thebes broke out again, but this time the Spartan army was defeated by the Thebes in the battle. As an alliance of Thebes, we should What measures will be taken in the next war? What do you think about this?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While most people were still reading the battle reports carefully and lost in thought, the commander of the Second Army, Matonis, had already praised loudly with admiration. : "Your Majesty, your previous judgment was very correct! The Thebans really defeated the Spartans who had been rampant in Greece for many years with fewer people!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the war began, Davos convened a military meeting , specifically analyzing this war.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While almost all senior generals were not optimistic about Thebes, Davos made a prediction and believed that Thebes was likely to win.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even though the generals respected Davos, they were doubtful about this judgment.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But I didn't expect that the final result would actually be predicted by King Davos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty." Chief of Staff Printors said immediately: "The Theban commander Ipamirondas you are interested in did indeed perform amazingly in this battle. He targeted the Spartans. The ingenious design of the traditional formation played a huge role, causing the Spartan army to have a strong combat effectiveness and a larger number of people, but it did not get much use at all and suffered a defeat. It seems that at the end of the year, Bis was able to withstand the Spartan army. The Badan attack was not only due to the bravery of its citizens, but also the excellent commanding abilities of their generals." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thebes, which was reborn in the disaster, is in line with Ansitanos's view. Their senior leaders are relatively united and capable. The outstanding and courageous Pelopidas is at the helm, and the army is commanded by the calm-minded and commanding Ipamilonda. The two sides cooperate closely, and the citizens are full of energy and are willing to contribute their efforts to the revitalization of Thebes. , I am not surprised to be able to defeat Sparta. I also believe that with Thebes' current upward momentum, they will have a shocking performance in the future. Are you right? Ansitanos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Although the successor of Foreign Minister Ansitanos has been determined, the decree has not yet been issued, so he still appeared at this important meeting. At this moment, he bowed slightly to Davos and said with some emotion: "Speaking of which Ashamedly, someone had judged that Thebes would rise a few years ago. I didn't pay attention to it at the time. I didn't expect that he was right. It's really amazing!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "oh?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos was surprised and asked curiously: "Who made such an accurate judgment?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Your Majesty, this is your son Apox. "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Ansitanos then repeated what Apox said in Theonia Academy one by one, and also emphasized: "There were many students participating in this class at that time, and they can all prove it. What I said is true.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There was a sound of admiration in the palace meeting hall, and everyone praised him: Apox is smart and intelligent, and can make amazing judgments at such a young age. He is worthy of being the son of His Majesty, and is favored by Hades...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos With a smile on his face, he looked very happy and listened carefully to the compliments of his ministers. After a while, he emphasized again: "Okay, everyone, let's get back to the topic.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   How do you think the situation in Greece will change after this war?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What measures should we take to deal with it?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Let's talk about your opinions.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Your Majesty. "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Lysias, the head of the auxiliary ministers, stood up tremblingly, holding his cane.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos quickly said: "Lord Lysias, sit down and talk!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sit down and talk!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Lysias did not hold on. He sat down again and said slowly: "Although we, Theonia, have formed an alliance with Thebes, the situation in Greece has always been complicated. We'd better not take it easy. Get involved and be dragged down by it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now, fortunately, the Thebans defeated Sparta. We can take advantage of this great opportunity. With Theonia having good relations with Thebes and Sparta, we can act as a mediator in the war. , prompting the two sides to reach an armistice agreement. I think this will not only help our ally Thebes, but also enhance our influence in Greece, and we will not be dragged into this war. This is a good thing that kills three birds with one stone. I I think Your Majesty, you should seriously consider it!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the beginning, Lysias did not agree with the alliance between Theonia and Thebes. However, Davos persisted and finally reached an alliance agreement. Now he is admonishing again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He just finished speaking , another auxiliary minister Antaoris immediately retorted: "Lord Lysias, I don't agree with your suggestion!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Why do we, Theonia, ally with Thebes?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not because of revenge on Sparta for tearing up the peace agreement, but because of the need for the development of the kingdom.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Today, the situation in Africa and Iberia is stable, Alpine Gaul has been conquered, and although the Ligurians occasionally riot, they are no longer a problem... In addition, other forces in the Western Mediterranean basically rely on our country, and the kingdom has gone through these years. Not only has it come out of the predicament after the Western Mediterranean War, agriculture, commerce, handicrafts... all aspects have made great progress. The people are prosperous and stable, and they are all eager to make progress eastward and set foot on the land of their ancestors. Win more glory and wealth!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "War...war!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Lysias slapped the back of the chair hard and said hoarsely with a trembling voice: "Continuously launching wars will not be of great benefit to the kingdom. It will destroy the stability of the kingdom and make the people greedy and warlike, which is not conducive to our future. Governance!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although previous wars have been successful, you have all seen the damage caused to the kingdom, which will take a long time to recover.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And victory cannot always belong to us. If we encounter failure in a future war, the consequences will be unimaginable... So we still have to be safe!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After saying this last sentence, he looked at Davos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked calm and did not respond.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Another auxiliary minister, Sipulos, said: "Lord Lysias, The alliance with Thebes is not only a need for the development of the kingdom, but also an important decision made by His Majesty based on the security of the kingdom.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   We all know that Persia has shown hostility to Theonia. It fully supports Greece's restoration of peace, and it is trying to unite the power of the entire Greece through Sparta to fight against us.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   We are separated from mainland Greece by the narrow Adriatic Sea. Once the Persian conspiracy is completed, the kingdom will become very unsafe on the east coast of Magna Graecia. That is why Your Majesty will take the initiative to join forces with Thebes. to destroy the Persian conspiracy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now that Thebes unexpectedly defeated the Spartan army, we should seize this favorable opportunity to decisively send troops to Greece on the grounds of supporting our allies, completely defeat Sparta, crush the Persian conspiracy, and in turn turn the Greek city-states into Become our ally, become the barrier to the east of the kingdom, and even become our forward base to threaten Persia!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Master Sipulos said it well!" Matonis, Olivers and other legion commanders praised in unison.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This made Lysias a little embarrassed, and even Antaolis felt a little uncomfortable.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos coughed twice, and the chamber immediately returned to silence.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Soon, Hakka's characteristic high-pitched and slow voice sounded in the hall: "I agree that we should use this opportunity to form an alliance with Thebes to set foot in Greece and destroy the Persian conspiracy... However, I am worried Although the Thebans won a battle, they are still at a disadvantage in the war. Is it possible that they will use this victory to reach an armistice with the Spartans?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka's words aroused everyone's attention. thinking.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "If Thebes really reached an armistice agreement with Sparta, then it would not be a good thing for us, because as an ally of Thebes, we would have no legitimate reason to send troops to Greece." Antaoris first He warned: "We Theonia have no influence in Greece, and even because we respect Hades, we are regarded as heretics by the Temple of Delphi. They have long been slandering the reputation of our sacred kingdom of Theonia in mainland Greece. Ordinary Greek people do not have a good impression of us. If we rush to send troops to Greece without legitimate reasons and without the support of allies, I am afraid it will arouse strong resentment among the Greek people and be extremely detrimental to our control of the situation there!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What's the matter? What's worrying! As long as we are strong enough to completely conquer Sparta, other city-states will naturally respect Theonia!" Matonis said loudly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Actually, in addition to Thebes, we have a legitimate reason to send troops to Greece, and we will also get the support of some Greeks." At this time, another auxiliary minister, Sedorum, interrupted, and he said to Davos After a salute, he said: "Your Majesty, do you still remember the promise you made to the Tyndares people after the war with Syracuse many years ago?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos suddenly felt enlightened, recalling the scene at that time, and sighed. He said in a loud voice: "If you didn't mention this, I almost forgot! I once made a promise to them that one day, they will be able to return to their hometown, rebuild their home, and worship their ancient heroes again... "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Some ministers in the hall understood this, and some looked confused. Haka couldn't help but ask: "Your Majesty, where is the hometown of the Tyndares?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Most of the Tyndares are from Boro. Pennesian Messenia, that land was forcibly occupied by Sparta a hundred years ago, and all the people who originally lived there were turned into helots enslaved by them, but Messenia The Asians were dissatisfied with the cruel rule of the Spartans, and their resistance never stopped. The ancestors of the Tyndareans went through a major uprising, and finally forced the Spartans to expel them from the Peloponnese. ..." Davos briefly narrated the history of the Tyndares people.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
