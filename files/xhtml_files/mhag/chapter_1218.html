   Chapter 1218 Conquest&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   of Thessaly During this period, in order to reserve sufficient rations for the Thessaly army fighting on the Peloponnese Peninsula, Asidamas had to purchase grain from outside (originally Jason&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There was a military plan to go south to conquer the Greek mainland, so a lot of food was stored in advance. However, due to the sudden invasion of the Peloponnese by the Theonian army, the original plan was disrupted. Jason led his army to fight south for nearly two months. In August, the original food reserves were almost exhausted, but the war seemed to be far away from ending. It was already August, and there was not much food left in the city-states of Thessaly, but the harvest season in September was still there. has not yet arrived, so it is necessary to purchase grain from outside to survive this relatively difficult time), and the grain from Yuk Xinghai naturally became Philae's first choice.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   To this end, the Ministry of Military Affairs found Sostatus, who had trade channels throughout the Mediterranean. Sostatus agreed to actively cooperate. He asked the fleet responsible for trade in the Uk Star Sea to pretend to be merchant ships from city-states in the Uk Star Sea. It carried food to Philae many times for sale, and most of the fleet's sailors were soldiers from the Mountain Reconnaissance Brigade. After going back and forth, the managers and patrol teams at the Philae port became familiar with this fleet from the Yuk Star Sea. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So just the day before the Theonian army landed in Thessaly, Saustatus' fleet deliberately arrived at the port of Philae in the afternoon. After unloading the food, it was already past dusk, and they were sailing in the Aegean Sea in the dark. After all, it was dangerous, so the entire fleet "had to" stay at the dock. When the Theonian fleet suddenly blocked the port of Philae on the second day, Sostatus' fleet was naturally unable to leave.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the next few days, the Theonian fleet has been cruising in the nearby waters and crashed many merchant ships trying to escape Philae. Sostatus' fleet has been staying in the port of Philae for safety reasons. Of course, there are many merchant ships from other countries that have also chosen this meandering method, so there are many ships parked in Philae's port, making Sostatus' fleet inconspicuous among them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But what Taygetus didn't expect was that Philae suddenly strengthened the management of the port. Not only did they prohibit foreign sailors from walking around the port at will, but they were not allowed to enter the city, and they also sent additional troops to the port.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, this was a precaution taken by Arcidamas when he saw too many foreign ships and crews in the port and was worried about accidents during the war.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although it was impossible for Asidamas to know that the Theonian army was already lurking in the port, he still made the right decision with his years of experience in government affairs.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But he never expected that Polyfulon killed Polydorus, and then brutally killed him and several other ministers. All the top officials of Philae were wiped out, which already made other officials panic. Riveron also mobilized most of Philae's citizen soldiers, and the order to monitor the port was no longer carried out. This gave members of Sostatus' fleet an opportunity to sneak into the city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Captain Keomenis, what good news have you heard?" Tagetus asked a little eagerly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Keomenis, a citizen of Theonia, one of the captains of the fleet under Sostatus, is responsible for the trade of the Uk Star Sea. After these years of running around, he has earned a lot of wealth. In the Thurii Chamber of Commerce He was somewhat famous, but in front of Taygetus, he didn't dare to boast at all. After all, this was a famous hero of the kingdom.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He rubbed his face vigorously with his hands, and his drunken appearance quickly disappeared, and he said with a serious face: "Didn't I invite some port officials I knew well to have drinks in a restaurant before? Guess what, it didn't cost me any money at all." I thought about what they were saying, and after just a few sips of wine, they took the initiative to tell me something... It turns out that the reason why the port suddenly relaxed its blockade in the past two days was because a big change happened in Philae City. !"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What happened?!" an officer from the mountain reconnaissance brigade nearby asked urgently.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "After Jason Tagus of Thessaly left with his army, he temporarily handed over the military command of the entire Thessaly to his brother Polydorus, and handed over the administrative power to Asida Mas and several other ministers, what do you think of the result?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Keomenis said word by word: "Polydorus suddenly died suddenly in the military camp outside Philae. It is said that he was assassinated by us. Killed, but the murderer was not caught -"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This is impossible!" Tagetus shook his head: "The Ministry of Military Affairs has not formulated an assassination plan against Polydorus, let alone in a heavily guarded military camp. Even those of us who have been trained for a long time would find it difficult to assassinate the lieutenant general, let alone escape smoothly." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Those officials quietly told me that many people suspected that Polifuron killed him .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Brother -" Keomenes saw the surprised expressions on the faces of the three people, and continued to reveal the secrets of Philae City with some satisfaction: "Because according to them, Polyfulon became violent after he took over the military command. He killed Asidamas and other ministers whom they respected, and then hurriedly mobilized most of the citizen soldiers in Philae City, and he personally led them to attack our army in Larissa. Before&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   leaving, he also appointed him One of his confidants is the city lord of Philae City. This new city lord has been doing one thing in the past two days. He is busy arresting officials who are dissatisfied with Polyfulon, causing chaos in the city. Not only are officials like them unwilling to continue performing official duties, there are also some people who are worried about their own safety and have begun to flee..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After listening to this, Tagetus and others felt incredible. What happened in the city of Philae The series of things simply provided huge help to the Theonian army. If the Ministry of Military Affairs did not give special tips to the mountain reconnaissance brigade before landing, Tagetus would even think that the Sailor named Polyfuron General Sally is a spy sent by the kingdom.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Have you asked them how many soldiers there are in the city now?" Tagetus asked.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Of course I will not forget such an important issue." Keomenes said confidently: "When Polyfulon left, he left 500 soldiers for his confidant. They were loyal to Polyfulon. The reason why the people of Lai do not dare to resist the new city lord... As for how many citizen soldiers are left in the city? They are not sure. But there should be not many left. They revealed a message to me. It is said that the new city lord plans to arrive when necessary. The port forcibly recruits foreign crews like us to participate in the battle."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Recruiting us? This is a good thing! Then we can take the opportunity to blend into Philae's army, assist our siege troops, and capture the city of Philae!" 1 The famous team officer said excitedly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Captain, Philae City is in chaos right now and people are panicking. This is a great opportunity! Why don't we launch a surprise attack in the dark and capture Philae City directly!" Another team officer put forward his own suggestion.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Tegetus pondered for a while and said solemnly: "This time we have less than 200 brothers who have sneaked into the city of Philae. We have too few troops and are not very familiar with the terrain in the city of Philae. We are launching a surprise attack in the dark again. , the danger is too great! Once we fail, not only will our previous efforts be in vain, but our brothers will also lose their lives in vain. We cannot take risks!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Tegetus paused, looked at his two capable captains, and continued to encourage: "You don't have to worry, now we all know that our army not only successfully landed, but also entered the Thessaly Plain. If the Thessalian army leaves the city to fight at this time, it will only suffer defeat. According to the tradition of the kingdom's army, and Philae is also the focus of the landing army's attack, they will continue to pursue the retreating troops to see if they can take the opportunity to capture Philae. This - is our opportunity!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Captain, I understand! I will immediately send a few soldiers to sneak into the city and closely observe the movements at several city gates." After&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   one team officer finished speaking, another team officer continued Said: "I asked my brothers to be ready at any time. Once our army reaches the city, we will rush to respond immediately."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Tagetus nodded with satisfaction: "That's it!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The mountain reconnaissance brigade lurking in the port of Philae The soldiers did not wait long. At dusk, many Thessalian troops were driven by the Theonian Cavalry Legion and rushed to the city of Philae.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The defenders on the city saw the Theonian army following them. Amid the pleadings and curses of the defeated soldiers, they had to carry out the orders of the new city lord and refused to open the door.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, the soldiers of the Mountain Reconnaissance Brigade who received the news took out the daggers and leather shields hidden under the ship's plank, rushed into Philae City, and attacked the south gate wall that was closest to them and had the fewest defenders.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After they defeated the defenders at the top of the city, they quickly opened the city gate, and the defeated troops poured in. The Theonian cavalry, light armor, and light infantry followed closely and rushed into the city of Philae...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the same day, Thessaly The powerful states in the south and north surrendered and fell one by one&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Woo!...Woo!..." The high-pitched military bugle sounded on the battlefield. There were constant sounds from behind, and the Greek soldiers who were fighting fiercely in front of various defensive camps hurriedly retreated.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not long after, the battlefield that had been noisy for most of the day fell silent. Only the countless corpses and wounded soldiers on both sides of the trenches and wooden walls showed the brutality of today's battle.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The setting sun has fallen below the mountain, and there are only a few pale traces of blood left on the horizon.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Iphicrates looked at the Theonian camps in front of him that were separated from each other and formed horns with each other. There was both unwillingness and helplessness in his eyes. He stood there for a long time, and finally sighed: "It's still the same as before, sending people to Theonia." The Onians asked for the battlefield to be cleaned."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   According to Greek tradition, after a battle, the defeated side can also send people to clean the battlefield and take away the compatriots who died in the battle in order to give them a decent burial.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
