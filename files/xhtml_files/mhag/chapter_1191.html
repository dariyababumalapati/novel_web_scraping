   Chapter 1191 Spartan Landing Battle (3)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Yesterday afternoon to dusk, under the cover of the 1st Fleet's feint attack, nearly 400 fleet infantry quietly landed on the promontory on the east side of the Laconia Gulf. They were lurking in the mountains. After preparing to rest on the spot for a night, they headed north over the mountains and ridges early on the second day and rushed to the beach where the main force of the fleet's infantry was to land.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But unfortunately, they encountered a shepherd herding sheep in the mountains. In order to prevent his whereabouts from being leaked, they detained him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Unexpectedly, this shepherd came from Minoa, a small town facing the sea to the east of the cape (not Minoa on the island of Sicily in the Kingdom of Theonia, but a small town on the edge of Sparta's territory, with mainly residents They were Pilians) not far from the mountain where the fleet infantry was hiding. At the request of the missing shepherd's family, Minoan residents went up to the mountain to search for it early the next morning. In order to prevent being discovered early, the fleet infantry had to They avoided the people of Minoa and took some long detours. When they hurried to the battlefield, the two sides were fighting fiercely.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the fleet infantry were anxious, the temporary commander of the surprise attack did not blindly command the troops to go into battle immediately. He stood high in the mountains and forests, carefully observed the battlefield situation, and quickly formulated an action plan: separate 50 troops Two soldiers held torches and rushed to the camp at the rear of the battlefield; while he led more than 300 soldiers to attack the left flank of the Spartan army and attack its flank and rear.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   His move soon had an effect: the helots who were struggling to support themselves were attacked from the rear and began to retreat; when the retreating helots saw the fire burning in the camp behind, they They even shouted in panic, and panic quickly spread among the Spartan army...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Helots and Pileas fled in all directions, and only the Spartans continued to fight.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing that the defeat was irreversible, Xenophon sighed and joined the fleeing ranks. He had to hurry back to Sparta, and maybe he could give some advice to the panicked Spartan elders.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Sekerian landed on the coast in a small boat, the battle on the coast was not completely over: more than 360 Spartan warriors (including some veteran warriors) formed a circular formation, surrounded by fleet infantry and soldiers of the Seventh Legion. , still insisting on fighting.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Sekolian learned about the situation, he believed that the Spartans were completely surrounded and would of course resist stubbornly, so he ordered to give up the northern passage.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The order was carried out quickly, and he had expected that the Spartans would quickly retreat so that the soldiers could pursue them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But the Spartans were still fighting and showed no intention of retreating.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian thought for a while and simply asked the soldiers to retreat and put distance between themselves and the Spartans.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He was not worried at all that the Spartans would take the opportunity to counterattack, because the Theonian soldiers besieging here not only had an absolute advantage in numbers, but also had an advantage in physical strength. After all, the fleet infantry was lightly armored, and The soldiers of the 7th Legion joined the battle later.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As for how much physical strength the Spartan warriors who have been fighting with all their strength have left, they only rely on the support of the dense circle defense. Once they want to switch from defense to offense, it will naturally be difficult to maintain the formation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Theonian soldiers retreated slowly and cautiously, while the Spartan warriors with rich combat experience remained where they were.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   They stood close together, shoulder to shoulder. The outermost row of warriors all straddled their horses, holding a round shield in one hand and a spear in the other. Most of their bodies were hidden behind the round shield, except for half of their heads. His butt was exposed from the upper edge of the buckler, and his cold eyes looked out through the narrow eyeholes of the helmet warily.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The comrades behind them not only put their shields on their backs to give them support, but also protruded their spears from above their right shoulders to help them fight the enemy... The entire Spartan warriors' formation was like an encounter. A hedgehog that has to hold its body together when in danger.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But when both sides were out of the battle and the sound of fighting disappeared, their rapid breathing could be clearly heard, and the copper shields they held were seen shaking slightly due to fatigue.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And around the circular formation lay the corpses of Spartan warriors, and there were also a few wounded soldiers who were so seriously injured that they were trampled repeatedly during the battle and could not move at all. They could only let out a low sigh. The same wail.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing this, Sekerian felt more confident. He walked out of the array of Theonian soldiers and said loudly and proudly: "I am Sekerian, the commander of this Theonian army! Spar Master, you have failed! Surrender, I will spare your life!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The entire circle remained motionless, and the Spartans seemed to have heard nothing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a long while, Eudamidas in the center of the formation said loudly and unevenly: "We...we can surrender...or allow you to occupy the ports of Ision and Hilles...but you must swear to God not to lead them." The army entered the city of Sparta!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After hearing this, Sekerian laughed and said sarcastically: "Spartans, you are still dreaming! It is no longer the time for you to dominate Greece and show off your power! We Dio Nea has already captured Messenia and will soon conquer Sparta. Maybe before long, your family will become slaves, and the helots who were once slaves will become their masters!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I just watched You are all warriors. I can't bear to have you die in the wilderness and become food for wild wolves and seabirds, so I mercifully let you surrender. Of course, I can understand why you choose to die, because after you die, you don't have to face the pain of Siba. To reach the reality that no longer exists..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian was talking when he suddenly saw the Spartan warrior in front roaring and throwing the spear in his hand at him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian was startled and hurriedly stepped back.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He was about 40 meters away from the Spartan circle, and the other side was heavy infantry. He thought this distance would be safer, but he didn't expect that the other side would suddenly make such a move.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Soldiers on both sides rushed forward quickly and protected him with leather shields.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It stands to reason that the range of a well-trained Spartan warrior throwing a javelin with full force exceeds 40 meters, and the leather shield used by the fleet infantry cannot provide good defense.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, the Spartan warriors who had fought so fiercely still had plenty of physical strength. The javelin they threw could not penetrate the leather shield and was easily blocked. It was just a false alarm.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But Sekerian was angered. He withdrew from the array with a gloomy face, but did not give an order to attack.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The two sides were in a strange stalemate.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a while, the Spartans saw the Theonian soldiers retreating in all directions again, and even gave way to a large opening in the direction of the sea.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then, they saw six wooden shelves with a height of one person placed side by side less than a hundred meters away. Some Theonian soldiers were operating something behind them, although the Spartans had not seen the crossbows with their own eyes. detailed appearance, but felt uneasy in my heart.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Fire!" the ballista commander gave the order, the hook string was released, the spring arm contracted violently, and the stone bullets whizzed out, hitting the Spartan warriors' circle with a small arc accurately.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I saw bucklers flying across the sky, blood splattered, limbs and legs broken, chests and heads broken... The originally perfect defensive formation instantly turned into a horrific and bloody scene. The extremely dense array of the Spartans made the crossbows more powerful. The power can be fully exerted.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Eudamidas, the commander of the Spartan army, fell into a pool of blood before he could even scream.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The living Spartans immediately realized that they could only sit and wait for death if they continued to hold on: "Fight the Theonians!!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   They roared and rushed towards the ballista unit in a swarm.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Theonian army, which had long been looking forward to the Spartan warriors doing this, quickly gathered together...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   battle ended, and the surrounded Spartan warriors No one surrendered and all died.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The 1st Fleet's landing battle won the final victory, but Sekerian was not too excited because he saw many corpses of fleet infantry since he landed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Seize the time and cremate the remains of the soldiers, but keep their belongings and urns well and hand them over to their families in full in the future...Use small boats to transport the medical staff ashore quickly and treat the injured soldiers as soon as possible.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   " Li'an said in a low tone, looked up at the sky, and then looked back at the tide: "The tide will begin to ebb soon. Order all the crew members of the fleet to pull out these wooden piles in the sea and open a channel first. Let our rations be transported in and unloaded at Port Hilles, otherwise the fleet infantry will have nothing to eat tonight and will have to rob the Spartans." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Understood, sir! I will execute it immediately." The subordinates followed the order and left.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Only then did Sekerian look forward and shouted with high spirits: "Follow me to the city of Sparta!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During the landing battle on the Spartan coast, the Theonian army suffered more than 1,500 casualties, and most of them were injured. The casualties mainly came from the attack of the Spartan warriors on the left wing and the long-range shooting of the archers from the coastal outpost; the Spartan army suffered about 2,000 casualties, of which all the Spartan warriors were wiped out and most of the old Spartan warriors were also killed, resulting in Today, all the main combat forces in Sparta's territory have been lost.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Due to the stubborn resistance of the Spartans, Sekerian was delayed on the coast for a long time. He led 300 soldiers of the Seventh Legion and 1,200 fleet infantry to the north. He neither saw his own troops nor fled along the way. The enemy soldiers only saw corpses being eaten by crows and wounded and wailing soldiers lying on the ground from time to time...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After marching for almost three hours, we could see the dense outline of houses ahead in the distance. Clean also saw a large fleet infantry unit resting in a wheat field, and soon met its commander Sephidorus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing that Sephidorus's right arm was wrapped with a cloth band and stained red with blood, Sekerian asked with concern: "You are injured, are you serious?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thanks to Zhengma Guying for the reward!&#13;
