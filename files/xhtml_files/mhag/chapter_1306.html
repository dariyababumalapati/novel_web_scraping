   Chapter 1306 Crossing the River&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And Davos once had a worry - that is, how to successfully cross the wide Euphrates River with the army under the heavy defense of the Persians. However, due to the retreat of the Persian army, this worry no longer existed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the past few days, the engineering battalion has built three wooden bridges across the Orontis River in front of the camp. 150,000 soldiers crossed the Orontis River in Syria in an orderly manner. Heading straight east.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Six days later, the vanguard was approaching Taposacus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Euphrates River rushes out from the mountains in eastern Asia Minor, flows from north to south at the westernmost end of the Mesopotamian plain, and joins many rivers in succession, forming a series of wide lakes, reaching Taposaku Near here, it turned eastward, causing the river surface to suddenly narrow, thus becoming the best crossing section of the upper reaches of the Euphrates River. The royal road connecting the Persian royal court to Asia Minor passed through here, which also led to the formation of Taposaku. The prosperity of the city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the Theonian vanguard arrived on the west bank of the Euphrates River, they were pleasantly surprised to find that the Persian army did not burn the pontoon bridge on the river during their retreat. Moreover, the pontoon bridge was very spacious and could accommodate 10 soldiers walking side by side at the same time, eliminating the need for an engineering battalion. No more hard work on the pontoon bridge.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The next day, Davos followed the Chinese army and came to the west bank of the Euphrates River.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He stopped at the pontoon bridge and stared at the soldiers wearing single clothes and carrying weapons and armor on their backs. With some kind of longing on their faces, they stepped firmly onto the pontoon bridge, crossed the wide Euphrates River, and embarked on the journey. The unfamiliar plains of Mesopotamia...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos, who was riding a horse, straightened his upper body regardless of fatigue, put his right fist on his left chest, and looked solemn.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The palace guards who followed him also saluted the soldiers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The soldiers passing by the bridge were surprised at first and then extremely excited when they saw this scene. However, the long dragon rolling forward did not allow anyone to stop moving forward, and the heavy packages on their shoulders made it impossible for them to free their hands, so most of them were in The young soldiers who were born in Theonia and grew up under the influence of countless victories and glory looked at the founder of the kingdom and the supreme military commander of the kingdom who had created many military miracles with great reverence, and shouted excitedly: " Your Majesty is victorious!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty is victorious!...Your Majesty is victorious!!...Your Majesty is victorious!!!..." The scattered shouts at the beginning soon converged into the same voice, echoing at the bridge. , and quickly spread to the front and rear of the team. The soldiers who learned the news seemed to have taken stimulants, forgetting the fatigue of the long journey, and accelerated their pace...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Looking at this exciting scene, Epithenes couldn't help but He sighed: "We were here 30 years ago. Like these little guys, we stepped on this pontoon bridge full of hope and entered the rich Mesopotamia plain ahead..." "Don't forget,&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Menon led As the vanguard of the entire army, we are the first to enter the Mesopotamian Plain!" Amyntas, half lying on the carriage, took over the conversation and said quite proudly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   His lower limbs were paralyzed and he could not walk. He was originally carried by slaves in a wooden sedan to march, but the speed was too slow and he could not keep up with the large army, so Davos allowed him to ride in a small open carriage.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the army landed in Egypt, his physical condition has been poor due to the acclimatization, but when the army re-entered the route that Cyrus the Younger marched to Babylon, his spirit became better.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Amintas, you have the nerve to say this!" Agarcia, who once belonged to another mercenary team, said disdainfully: "Back then, Menon rushed to be a vanguard, saying he wanted to explore the way for the army, but... Everyone knew that he just wanted to be the first to plunder on the Mesopotamian plains, so Cyrus agreed to his request and then issued an order to the entire army to prohibit plundering on the Mesopotamian plains. , were you very disappointed at that time?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What do I have to be disappointed about -" Amyntas was about to retort, but suddenly thought of something, and deliberately said loudly: "Hieronymus, what you just said is' We're we'! Don't forget, His Majesty was also one of'us' back then!" As he said that, he also pointed at Davos, who was standing in front of him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hearing this, Agarcia, who had always been so secretive among this group of veterans, became a little panicked and argued eagerly: "Don't talk nonsense, I...I -" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Actually, the reason why we were Joining the mercenary army and serving Cyrus the Younger is all for survival." Hieronymus, who was once the leader of another mercenary army, spoke in time to resolve Agcia's embarrassment: "In fact, even if Cyrus the Younger In order to solve the shortage of military expenditure, the soldier once allowed us to plunder Asia Minor many times. The reason why he did not allow us to plunder Mesopotamia may be that he thought that Mesopotamia would be his rule after he won the throne. The core area below, so the people here cannot be resentful towards him."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alexis sighed: "Asia Minor is part of the Persian territory, but neither Cyrus the Younger nor Artaxerxes cherished it. That vast land instead regards the people there as foreigners and wants everything from them. How could the people of Asia Minor not rebel? How could the people in other parts of Persia be truly loyal to Persia!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   We should thank the Persians for doing this, because they Only by not treating other races as our own can we have the opportunity to invade this vast land and finally defeat this powerful enemy!" Matonis pointed at the soldiers of the First Legion crossing the river and said proudly: "These little guys We were luckier than us. We were just tools in the hands of the Persians, and we died in this strange land in a meaningless struggle for power for the Persian royal family. Although they repeated our marching route, they were fighting for themselves and Fighting for the kingdom, they will create an unprecedented great victory!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "That's great, Matonis." Amyntas leaned back on the couch of the carriage and said with a hint of ridicule: "Although you were not here back then. In the team I commanded, I had heard of you at that time, a strong and brave but rough-tempered recruit who gave the team officers a headache... No one would have thought that in the past few decades you would have become the commander of tens of thousands of people. A general of the soldiers, and he speaks in such an orderly manner..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Lord Amyntas, I heard about you back then." Matonis retorted unceremoniously: "You know why I didn't want to go to you back then. The centurion under your command? Because everyone calls you a mad dog under Menon. Although you often lead the troops to rush to the front, you have no tactics to speak of, and every time you suffer heavy casualties... But I'm afraid I followed you back then. The mercenaries who died here would never have thought that in a few decades you would become an important minister of a powerful kingdom and a famous general praised by the people."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Matonis's harsh words touched Amyntas's heartstrings, and he did not refute. Instead, he remained silent for a moment with a painful expression, and then said in a deep voice: "We came to Persia this time not only to avenge the King of Persia and wash away the shame of the past, but more importantly, to find the bones of our comrades and bring them home. ..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as these words came out, everyone fell into silence, and the atmosphere became a little solemn.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Henepolis, who had been listening to the records and collecting information for the biography to be written in the future, couldn't help but asked in a low voice: "My lords, you have just said so much, can you... briefly talk about your majesty at that time? ? He should have been a young recruit at that time, right?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alexis, Felicius, Thormid and others seemed to have not heard what Henipolis was saying, and began to talk to each other as if no one was watching.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even Amyntas and Epithenes, who usually spoke freely, were afraid of being entangled by the annoying Henepolis, so they simply closed their eyes and pretended to sleep.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Matonis, who was in the same team as Davos and was very familiar with him, even pulled Georgris and left the crowd on the grounds that he "wanted to urge the soldiers to march faster."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It's not because time has passed and they can no longer remember King Davos' performance here. On the contrary, they clearly remember: when the mercenaries came to the Euphrates River, the young Davos was swept away by this unusually wide river. They were so shocked that their legs felt weak when they stepped onto the pontoon. Matonis supported him almost the whole way to the other side...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   If they truthfully tell the truth about these embarrassing things about Davos back then, it will cause harm to the people of the kingdom today. How big of an impact?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What's more, today, 30 years later, when they revisited the old place and looked back on the past, they felt even more emotional: Compared with their companions who died here, how lucky they were!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not only did he escape from being chased and intercepted by the Persian army, but he was also able to fight back in his lifetime, trample the once invincible enemy under his feet, and wash away his shame!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   All this is because of the man standing in front of him. It was under his leadership that the impossible became possible and created unprecedented miracles!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, they were filled with gratitude and respect for Davos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I don't know how long it took, but Davos turned around and said energetically: "Brothers, it's time for us to cross the river!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Everyone responded loudly in unison: "As you command, Your Majesty!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166; &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos crossed the Euphrates River and found that the situation was just as the scout said: the originally golden fields were burned to black, and villages that had become ruins could be seen everywhere. , one of the largest ruins was the city of Taposakus. Not only were the residences in the city burned down, but even the city walls were completely destroyed. This made the legionnaires who originally wanted to save the hard work of building camps to be very angry, and they all scolded the Persians for being cowardly. Like a rat.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the surrounding environment became a bit harsh, Davos still issued an order: the entire army built a camp near the city of Taposakus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
