   Chapter 1158. The new army commander,&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ctissus did not let Alsinis and others carry out the execution, but did it himself, because he could well control the force and the placement of the blow, which not only made Tepandes&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It feels very painful without hurting the muscles and bones.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After ten sticks, Tepandes did not dare to scream loudly, touched his buttocks, and returned to the team obediently, and followed his teammates for emergency march training.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The messy heavy footsteps and the harsh clash of armor continued to sound, and then, led by Alsinis, the young people sang the "Song of the Legion" in unison, covering up the noise.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After 50 laps, although the formation of the entire column was still in chaos, most of the young people were out of breath, and a few were even unsteady on their feet.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the young people wanted to take a breath, Ctissus' stern voice sounded: "An enemy appeared 100 meters in front of you. Immediately split the columns into square formations. After marching steadily for 50 meters, they merged into a continuous horizontal formation. , and then charge!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Upon hearing this, there was a small commotion in the team, and someone expressed dissatisfaction in a low voice.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ctissus glanced at the team with a majestic look, and said disdainfully: "What's the matter? You can't complete this amount of exercise?! You must know that the commander of the Amyntas led the first legion to fight against the Romans in the Volscian territory. During the first battle, in order to seize the opportunity, the entire legion of 8,000 people, whether heavy infantry, light armor, or light infantry, marched for more than ten miles and immediately went into battle. You should know that the Romans at that time were very powerful. Strong, but the soldiers of the First Legion, dragging their exhausted bodies, finally defeated the Roman army and won their first victory over the Romans. Of course, the casualties were not small..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ctissus's eyes flashed sadly. However, he emphasized his tone and said: "You also said that you want to become an outstanding soldier of the First Legion, but if you can't even complete this small task, what qualifications do you have to become a formal soldier? I think it is better to take the kingdom's exam and become a The civil servants of the kingdom are better."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The gasps in the team disappeared, and every young man blushed and stared at Ctissus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alcinis shouted sharply: "Brothers, pay attention, the column has changed into a square formation!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Roar!!!" The young people responded in unison...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the Kingdom of Theonia, military training officers are also divided into levels, and the military training of the Ministry of Military Affairs The chief is the most senior, followed by the military training officer of the military camp in a region, and then the military training officer of the town. Some towns are too large, such as Catanai, which has several military training officers, and each military training officer is responsible for several Demo districts. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The reason why military training officers are so divided is to ensure that citizens during the service period can receive adequate training. After all, the Kingdom of Theonia has a vast territory. During the busy farming season, military camps in an area only train once every seven or eight days. Citizen soldiers alone It takes a day to gather in the military camp, so some usual military basic training is often carried out by military training officers in various towns and Demo districts. They will seize all their free time to conduct strict military training for citizen soldiers nearby, such as morning training. Training and night training to help citizen soldiers improve their military capabilities. This is an important manifestation of Theonia's emphasis on military affairs.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Town and Dermo military training officers are basically served by retired legionnaires. Their salary is very low. They hold this position mainly out of nostalgia for military life and loyalty to the kingdom.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Amendolara has developed over the years and has a population of just over 10,000, it is a small town. Therefore, there is only one military training officer: Ctissus. But in the past, he had to train thousands of people. Just because the first The legion was transferred to fight in the Peloponnese, and only a few hundred young citizens were left in the entire town.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although it was only morning training today, he trained continuously for two hours. When the red sun in the east jumped out of the sea, dispelled the morning fog in the mountains and cast a scorching light, Ctissus announced that the training was over. , all the young people collapsed to the ground from exhaustion.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, Ctissus changed his previous serious look, walked up to each young man, and commented on his previous training performance. Most of them were mainly complimentary, and he also asked with concern if Tepandes was feeling unwell. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Tepandes repeatedly said that he was fine, Curtisus still asked the doctor who had been on the sidelines to treat his previous stick injury. Curtisus did not mount him until all the young people had left safely. The Brutti horse walked leisurely down the mountain along the gentle mountain road.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Along the way, he greeted and chatted with familiar people in Amendolara from time to time. When he got home, it was almost noon, and then he heard the servant tell him that important guests were waiting in the living room.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Lord Alexis, why do you have time to come to me?" Ctissus walked into the hall and saw the Minister of Military Affairs, a little surprised.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alexis did not answer directly, but after looking at him carefully, he said happily: "It seems that you have been training after retiring."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ctisus sat down on the wooden chair and didn't care. In the presence of Alexis, he immediately took off his breastplate and helmet, and the servants immediately came to take them away.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ctissus moved his aching body and said, "I can't help it. Who calls me a military training officer? If I want those brats to obey, sometimes I have to lead by example." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It seems that you are doing a good job as a military training officer .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ." Alexis praised, and then said seriously: "I am here this time on behalf of His Majesty and the Ministry of Military Affairs to ask you to take over as the commander of the First Legion."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Take over?" Ctissus was very surprised. : "Isn't the commander of the first army Proseus?!" Although after Leoticides became the commander of the first army, Ctissus retired after serving under him for only a few years, but he felt that this The relatively young legion commander is still very capable.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alexis sighed, briefly recounted the fact that "Proseus is the prince of Sparta", and then said sincerely: "I know you have always refused to serve as the commander of the legion, but now the situation is special. The first legion is in the battlefield, but lacks a chief officer. A battle may break out at any time, resulting in excessive casualties. When appointing others as commanders of the first legion, they are worried that they will not have time to familiarize themselves with the legion, establish prestige, and convince the soldiers. Unable to give full play to the combat effectiveness of the First Army... After much thought, you are the only one who is most suitable. Are you willing to take over the position of commander of the Army at this time and help the First Army tide over the difficulties?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay, I am willing. Accept this appointment." Ctissus did not hesitate, but he emphasized: "But this is only a temporary appointment. When the war is over, I will retire and go home." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   No problem." Alexis nodded in agreement.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "When will we set off?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "We have to wait a few days, because the Ministry of Military Affairs is also preparing to send the Seventh Army and the First Cavalry Army to Messenia."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Is it necessary to send so many soldiers to deal with a Sparta?" Ctissus was confused.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This is your Majesty's decision." Alexis simply replied.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "By the way, Proseus resigned as commander of the First Army and also resigned as commander, so who will take over as commander of the expeditionary force?" Ctissus only then remembered to ask this question. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alexis hesitated for a moment and said: "Klotokatax."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Who?" Ctissus was stunned for a moment, and then realized who the other party was talking about, and his eyes widened: "How is that possible? Let him be the commander-in-chief! Even though he is His Majesty's eldest son, he has never had the experience of commanding an army in combat-" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Chief of Staff Printols will serve as the temporary staff officer of this army and will be mainly responsible for military affairs." Alec Sith interrupted him and simply said this.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, several chief officers of the Ministry of Military Affairs did not agree with the appointment issued by King Davos. However, after all, the army was under the direct control of King Davos. With his insistence, Alexis could only obey.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Although Lord Printors is assisting, it is still a bit hasty for Prince Crotokartax to serve as the commander..." Ctissus was still muttering.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This is an order given by His Majesty himself!" Alexis emphasized again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ctissus fell silent.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "As a veteran, you have to assist Prince Crotokartax when you go to the Peloponnese this time! This is also for the First Legion!" Alexis reminded again: "In this way, you will go to Peloponnese tomorrow. Rush to Thurii, meet with His Highness the Prince, and assist him in handling the military affairs for the expedition." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Okay, I listen to you." Ctissus reluctantly agreed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The next day Ctissus arrived at the Thurii camp and was grandly welcomed by Crotokatax and respected him very much. This was beyond Ctissus's expectations and impressed him greatly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the subsequent process of handling military affairs, Clotokatax not only actively listened to the opinions of Printors and Ctissus, but also showed his familiarity with military affairs, and began to change Ctissus somewhat. misunderstanding that he has no military experience.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A few days later, the Seventh Army moved north and entered Camp Turiyi.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A few days later, the second fleet arrived at the port of Thurii from Lilibi. Under the farewell of Davos and the ministers, Clotokatax led the Seventh Legion, the First Cavalry Legion and some others. The troops, totaling more than 10,000 people, boarded warships and headed for the Peloponnese Peninsula.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In January 370 BC (the twenty-fourth year of the Kingdom of Theonia), the fleet arrived at the coast of Messenia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the simple dock, Clotokatax, who disembarked from the ship, was grandly welcomed by the senior generals of the expeditionary army and the Messenian parliamentarians headed by Tisias.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Compared with others, Leoticides is obviously not a person who can express enthusiasm with words and actions, so he seems a little indifferent in the crowd. If someone else takes over, the new commander will see this moment. Leotychides would more or less think that Leotychides was dissatisfied with being removed from his position as commander!&#13;
