   Chapter 1193 Leoticides' new mission&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes." Aristelas responded. He had already warned him that as for what measures King Davos would take in the future, it was not his concern. It's over.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "By the way, have the Macedonians joined this alliance?" Davos suddenly remembered Thessaly's close neighbor and the legendary country in its previous history, and couldn't help but ask casually.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Oh, I heard that Athens also sent an envoy to Macedonia, but King Marston was seriously ill and could not get out of bed, so he rejected the request of the Athenian envoy. The situation in Macedonia is now a bit chaotic, and there is Thessaly in the south. Under such circumstances, the King of Macedonia did not dare to take the risk of sending his army south to fight."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Macedonia was still a weak country at this time..." Davos muttered with a sigh.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, there was a knock on the door.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Please come in."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Henepolis stood at the door and said: "Your Majesty, Proseus is here."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, I will go down first." Aristelas said immediately and knowingly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Thank you for your hard work! After I return, I will continue to pay close attention to the developments in various city-states in mainland Greece and report to me at any time." Davos said seriously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the kingdom's intelligence chief left, Devost tidied up his appearance and then said to Henipolis: "Heni, go pick him up in person."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay." Henipolis understood. nodded.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as Leoticides entered the office, Davos greeted him warmly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty." Although he was not wearing armor, Leoticides still gave a very formal military salute.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Davos returned the greeting, he motioned for him to sit down, and then he sat on the wooden chair opposite him and asked with a smile: "How have you been resting these days?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I'm so busy that I still hope to have something to do. "Leotichides still had a hint of prayer on his somewhat dull face.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Actually... neither I nor the Ministry of Military Affairs care about your past identity. There are quite a few people in the Senate who were once the king of a certain force, the chief general of a certain city-state, or the leader of a certain tribe. Many of them were once enemies. Now they are all citizens of Theonia, contributing their own strength to the kingdom, not to mention you have made many contributions to the kingdom over the years!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Davos finished sighing, he suppressed his smile and said seriously: "But you You have been concealing your true identity, and this concealment has had a great impact on this military operation. This is why I decided to transfer you back and the Ministry of Military Affairs temporarily suspended you." "It is true that you have been concealing your&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   true identity. It's my fault, and I have no objection to the punishment imposed by the Ministry of Military Affairs." Leo said with the same seriousness as he mentioned the gains and losses.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Now there is a question." Davos patted the armrest lightly: "From now on, should I call you Proseus? Or Leoticides?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides answered immediately without hesitation. : "Lerticides has become a thing of the past. I am now a citizen of Proseus and Theonia, and Proseus will be passed down as the surname of my family."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The corner of Davos's mouth showed With a hint of smile, he said: "Two days ago, the Egyptian envoy came to Thurii and told me the news that 'Persian troops are gathering in large numbers in East Phoenicia with an attempt to invade Egypt'. The Tower of the Pharaoh of Egypt Nice hopes that when the Persian army invades Egypt in a large scale, we Theonia can send reinforcements to Egypt..." When&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides heard this, he subconsciously grabbed the armrest.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sure enough...Davos looked at him and said unhurriedly: "Egypt is our ally, and it selflessly assisted us with a large amount of food during the Western Mediterranean War, allowing us to survive the most difficult period. . Now that they are encountering difficulties, of course we should lend a helping hand and give full support.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition, Persia regards Theonia as an enemy and sent reinforcements to help Carthage during the Western Mediterranean War. In the past two years, it has incited the Greek mainland to The city-states have united to fight against us... So aiding Egypt and attacking Persia is a good thing that kills two birds with one stone. The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   meeting of the Kingdom's administrative ministers has passed a resolution to 'rescue Egypt'. After discussing with the Ministry of Military Affairs, I think you are the most suitable person to serve as the commander of the reinforcements. Candidate, are you willing to accept this appointment and go to fight in Persia?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course Leoticides, who has been idle for a while, is willing to accept this appointment, but he still suppressed the impulse in his heart and asked first: "Your Majesty, I wonder which legions the kingdom will send as reinforcements?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos praised Leoticides for remaining calm under such circumstances. He said loudly: "Currently we are considering three legions from Sicily. The main force of the reinforcements, the 2nd Fleet, provides assistance at sea. In addition, considering that Egypt has a vast and flat area, which is conducive to cavalry galloping, we are prepared to let the African light cavalry regiment also participate in the expedition. Considering that the Persian army mainly focuses on projection, we will also recruit 2,000 How about the Balearic slingers... Are you satisfied with this arrangement?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Your Majesty, I am willing to accept your appointment." Leoticides responded decisively.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Persia is not our Theonia. Their military mobilization will not be that fast. I am afraid it will take some time to actually attack Egypt. You don't have to be too anxious. Go to Sicily first and get familiar with the legions you will command.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Among these troops, the Eighth Army has the strongest combat effectiveness, and you are the old commander of the Eighth Army. You have led it to win many honors. I believe that if you take over this support army, you will get the support of the soldiers faster...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, You should not assemble the army on a large scale first to avoid premature consumption of military rations. After all, the army in the Peloponnese consumes a lot of military rations."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After hearing this, Leoticides couldn't help but ask: "Wait a minute. After I lead the army to Egypt, what will happen to the ration supply?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Egyptian Pharaoh Tanis has promised in his letter that he will supply all the rations for the reinforcements." Davos said calmly: "Egypt has always been The main granary of the Mediterranean, its political situation has been relatively stable in recent years. It is said that the food reserves are sufficient, so you don't have to worry. Of course, the Ministry of Military Affairs will also send you some supplies as a supplement in time."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides nodded. , said nothing for a moment.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked at him, but continued: "I heard that when you left Messenia, you once reminded Crotocathax, 'Don't relax your vigilance against other Greek city-states except Sparta. They have always been fickle...'.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now, your worries have become a reality. Many Greek city-states, led by Athens, are forming an alliance against Theonia, which will undoubtedly give us strategic implications for controlling the Greek mainland. There will be great difficulties, and if our war in Greece cannot be ended in a short time, we will have to reinforce Egypt, and we will undoubtedly fall into the dilemma of fighting on two fronts... You know Greece well, what suggestions do you have?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   " Listening to Davos's words, Leoticides was thinking about this issue in his mind. Having become a commander, he certainly did not want to affect the reinforcement of Egypt because of the war in Greece.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a moment, he said: "Your Majesty, a few years ago the Gauls in Italy were regarded as ferocious beasts by the Etruscan, Latin and other races in the north. They were numerous, fierce and aggressive, and were even regarded as a serious problem by the kingdom.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But Your Majesty, you summoned an army of 100,000 men at one time and defeated the Gauls in just a few months. Now their territory has been incorporated into the kingdom."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides briefly mentioned the plan to conquer the Gauls. After all, he was the commander of the Northern Expedition to Gaul at that time. Talking too much would undoubtedly be suspected of boasting.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The war in mainland Greece is actually somewhat similar to the Gallic war. It seems that there are many city-states and the situation is complicated, and it seems that its citizens are also good at fighting. But in fact, the Peloponnese Peninsula, Central Greece, and Northern Greece are even relatively small. The land area of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;the upper Ionian Islands is far less than that of the kingdom, and the population is even worse, not to mention weapons, equipment, and logistical supplies...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   His Majesty can completely concentrate the kingdom's vast territory just like he conquered the Gauls. The majority of the army will launch an all-out attack on the Greek mainland with a military force that far exceeds that of the Greek mainland. They will definitely be able to complete the conquest of the Greek mainland in a short period of time."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Hmm..." Davos stroked his chin with his hand, thoughtfully.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After sending Leoticides away, Davos asked Henepolis to bring a wooden map of mainland Greece, and looked at the map alone, lost in thought.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Arcidamas walked into the palace of the city lord of Philae and saw Tagus Jason of Thessaly at the door of the living room. Pacing back and forth, he stepped forward and asked, "My lord, what brings you to me?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Jason came back from his thoughts, held Asidamas' arm in a more respectful manner, and walked into the living room. , after asking him to sit down, he said solemnly: "I just received the news that the Theonian army defeated the 30,000 army formed by Sparta with the support of Persia in Tegea!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sparta again Suffered a defeat in a battle?!" Arcidamas was shocked by this news. For a politician who spent most of his life under the era of Sparta's dominance, it was a bit difficult to accept for a while.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, I heard that the Theonians not only defeated the Spartan army, but also occupied the Spartan camp, captured many soldiers, and drove the defeated Spartan troops into the mountains. They also took the opportunity Captured Tegea... Jason said emotionally.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Asidamas breathed a sigh of relief and said with some sigh: "It can be seen that even with the support of Persia, the Spartans cannot be The decline of the Theonian opponents is inevitable... Sir, what are your plans?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Jason sat down on the chair next to him and said, "I want to hear your advice first.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
