   Chapter 1128 Sparta's decision&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The one who felt most relaxed was Tamagoras. He not only used the opportunity of his mission to reach an agreement with the Spartan envoy on certain aspects, but also completed the Callistratus before leaving. He was entrusted to him by Si, and he also gained a lot of wealth. This initial harvest was quite rich, which will increase his influence among the people of Athens.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Unexpectedly, things backfired. Soon after returning to Athens, Tamagoras was reported by the people, saying that "he accepted bribes in Persia, betrayed the secrets of Athens, and betrayed the city-state...".&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition, there are many rumors in the city of Athens, mainly saying that "his behavior in Babylon was obscene, and he was not as good as Pelopidas of Thebes. He was despised by the Persians and simply lost the face of the Athenians"...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not long after, the Athenian government put Tamagoras on trial. Although he tried his best to defend himself and hired a good lawyer, most of the citizens on the jury still believed that he was guilty, and he was eventually sentenced to death.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Lutikli returned to Sparta, the tough demands made by the Persians also caused a lot of trouble in Sparta.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus, who had always paid more attention to Theonia, strongly opposed it. He reminded loudly: "After Theonia defeated Carthage, the national power became stronger and it has already constituted a great threat to our Sparta." Fortunately, there is a friendly agreement, and this kingdom has always claimed to keep its promises, so even if we did some bad things to it during the agreement, it still maintained peace with Sparta. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But now we have to take the initiative to cancel the agreement, which just gives the other party an excuse. Once Theonia sends troops to intervene in this war, it will definitely bring disaster to the Spartan army, which is trying its best to deal with Thebes! "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Another Cleombrotus, the king of Sparta, stood up and firmly supported meeting the Persians' demands. His reasons were equally good: "This war has continued until now, and we in Sparta have become somewhat unsustainable. If it were different, If Theonia cuts off contact, we will not get the support of Persia, and if the King of Persia turns to support our enemy Thebes as he said, then Sparta will face a huge danger of being defeated. And if the cancellation With the friendly agreement with Theonia, we will get the full support of Persia. Then, like the Corinthian War, we will not only end this war quickly, but also become the overlord of Greece again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   By then, even if Theonia Diaonia has declared war on us, and we can also summon the power of all Greece to fight against it. What's more, judging from the fact that Persia is so eager to threaten us to sever ties with Theonia this time, it seems that the king of Persia is hostile to Theonia Yes, he will definitely give his full support to our war with Theonia. We can just rely on this favorable situation to defeat the Theonia and completely solve this hidden danger that has always worried us." "It is said that&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Diony Asia sent 100,000 troops in the war with Carthage. Peloponnese is separated from Theonia by a narrow Adriatic Sea. Once the friendly agreement is terminated, Theonia will really be of great help to us. Sparta declares war, and these 100,000 troops are likely to land in the Peloponnese. How should we respond then?" Teacher Agassiz asked seriously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Today, Cleombrotus no longer has the fear and immaturity he had when he was rushed to the throne. He calmly replied: "Don't forget, Dionysius also led an army of 100,000 to attack The Carthaginians in western Sicily. But in fact, we all know that the only ones with real combat effectiveness are the tens of thousands of mercenaries. Do you dare to say that the 100,000 troops in Theonia are all elites?! I don't think so.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the contrary After we have re-reached contracts with the Greek city-states, if Theonia really dares to send troops to land in the Peloponnese, we can just call on the Greek city-states to resist the invasion of Theonia, an outsider. With their help, we can form a large army and defeat it. Not only will it completely solve Sparta's long-standing worries, but it will also re-enhance Sparta's influence in Greece."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus frowned and reminded: "Since the establishment of Theonia, they have never suffered a defeat in the wars they have experienced. Even if their army is not all elite, their combat effectiveness is definitely not weak. And they are from the same country's army, and even if we can call Each city-state formed a large army, but this time the army will definitely not be as united as them, which is not conducive to command-"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Respectable Agesilaus!" Cleombrotus suddenly sneered: "These years we How could Sparta not command the coalition forces of other city-states to fight against the enemy, and win more than they lose? This is the talent that our Spartan generals must have! More than 10 years ago, you even commanded the people of Asia Minor to fight against Persia. Why now? On the contrary, it is wrong for us to do this!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before Agesilaus could respond, Cleombrotus looked around, suddenly raised his voice, and said loudly: "The so-called Theonian army is victorious in every battle, that's because They did not meet us, Sparta! Everyone still remembers the threatening words that the King of Theonia said before signing a friendly agreement with Theonia for the first time! He has been like a poisonous snake in these years Peeping at us on the west coast of the Adriatic Sea, we have been on tenterhooks and dare not slack off. Now may be the time to solve this problem! Dear wise elders and censors, can Sparta survive this difficulty? , it depends on your decision!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus looked at Cleomebrotus who gave an impassioned speech in the center of the venue, and for some reason, his mind came to the same place where he defeated his nephew Leon through eloquence more than 20 years ago. Ortizides, the scene where he takes the throne.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But now that I am old, weak, sick and disabled, do I really have no courage anymore?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ...Agesilaus hesitated: breaking off diplomatic relations with Theonia and offending Theonia might trigger a war; but continuing to make diplomatic relations would offend Persia, which would turn to support Thebes. In the current situation, Not only will the war not stop, but it will become more difficult... This is a dilemma.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus opened his mouth but did not refute in the end.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then the 30 Spartan elders (including two kings) voted on "whether to cancel the friendly agreement with Theonia."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   These Spartan nobles who are over 60 years old may have rich life experience, but most of them are conservative in character and only seek safety in everything. Because although Theonia is closer to the Peloponnese, it has never set foot in mainland Greece. On the contrary, Persia, thousands of miles away, has always exerted influence on Greece. Whether it was the Peloponnesian War or the Corinthian War, Persia was a huge help to Sparta, and these elders were undoubtedly the leaders of these wars. Those who have experienced it all feel it deeply.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But the final voting result was 20:20. In fact, the influence of Agesilaus played a big role in it. Compared with Cleomebrotus, who has not performed well in the military so far, many elders are more Be willing to believe in the wise and powerful Agesilaus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now, the final decision rests with five inspectors.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Spartan censors had great power. They could review and supervise the king and elders internally, and they were responsible for diplomacy and supervising the troops abroad. However, they were selected from ordinary civilians who had been educated since childhood. They underwent arduous military training and continued to fight as adults. They did not leave collective life until they were 30 years old. In addition to being proficient in military skills, most of them did not know much about politics, diplomacy and other aspects, like Cleethorpes. There are not many citizens who are well-informed and politically intelligent, so Sparta has always been tougher on the outside world in recent years. It will only choose to retreat when it suffers serious setbacks.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But the five inspectors elected this year have all chosen without exception to break off diplomatic relations with Theonia. The reason is very simple: the successive wars with Thebes have not made any significant progress, but the country is becoming increasingly difficult. Soldiers continued to suffer casualties, the people were miserable, and war weariness was very serious. The choices of the censors reflected the public opinion at this time. The Spartan people were eager to stop the war and restore peace.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As for the possibility that this will lead to a more powerful enemy Theonia, they will not consider that far.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This result did not disappoint Agesilaus, but rather relieved him: since the gods had made a choice for Sparta, he did not need to worry about anything anymore.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Cleombrotus saw Agesilaus standing up again, he couldn't help but said proudly: "Now that the resolution to sever diplomatic relations with Theonia has been passed, it is useless even if you want to refute it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   " Gesilaus ignored him, looked around at everyone and said: "Even if we decide to break off diplomatic relations with Theonia, we should send a messenger who can speak and tactfully explain to the King of Theonia why we have to break off diplomatic relations. If we are sincere enough, I believe we will not anger the Theonians and declare war on us at the critical moment of our peace talks with Thebes." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I said, Sparta is not afraid of fighting against Theonia .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   , we can just take advantage of this good opportunity to solve this big trouble!" Cleombrotus reminded dissatisfiedly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "King Agesilaus makes sense. It would be best if we could reach a peace agreement with Thebes and Athens and temporarily prevent Theonia from provoking a war." Not just most elders are interested in this Even the censors had no objections, but they were troubled by the choice of ambassador.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Because judging from the only few instances of dealing with Theonia in the past, the king of Theonia was not an easy person to talk to, so he sent an envoy who he was familiar with and who was good at diplomacy to Thurii, The effect is definitely much better, but both Cleithops and Phoebus have been killed one after another, and the rest of the Spartans are completely unfamiliar with Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
