   Chapter 1097: Selection of the Regional Chief Executive (1)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked around, and finally his eyes fell on Haka in the front row. A few smiles appeared on his face as a greeting, and then he nodded towards Antaoris.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Dang!" Antaoris rang the small copper bell on the table, and then the etiquette officer in front of him shouted: "The meeting has begun! (In the past, the rotating chairman would call, but there are more and more senators, and the whole meeting has begun!" It was a very laborious task to speak to them in front of the sky, and the five rotating chairmen were all older. There were several incidents where the rotating chairperson became hoarse and collapsed from exhaustion at the end of the meeting, so it was later changed to a younger etiquette. The official took over the work).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Antaoris then cleared his throat and said loudly: "The bill proposed by His Majesty before to 'divide the kingdom's territory into nineteen regions' has been passed. The main issue today is to Let us elect the chief executives of these regions.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the Roman region, southern Iberia, and western Sicily are located on the borders of the kingdom, the situation is complex and the situation is relatively bad. For the security of the kingdom, special candidates have been determined, with Asistes as the administrator of the Roman region, Bagule serves as the administrator of the southern Iberia region, and Antonios serves as the administrator of western Sicily..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There was a little commotion in the venue. Davos had not determined the candidate for the administrator of the western Sicily region before. Some people may There was still hope, but when he heard it was Antonio, he immediately lost his temper.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Antonio had made mistakes before, he had served as the administrator of important towns in the kingdom for many years, and during the Western Mediterranean War, he served as the chief executive of the Dauni region. As a wartime governor, he firmly controlled the Dauni region, which had just been conquered and was invaded by the Samnites. This was not an easy task, which shows his excellent governance skills. In addition, he served as a military officer. Middle and senior generals have outstanding merits and high qualifications, so no one raises any objection to this.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The remaining regional chief executives are elected by the elders in accordance with the previous chief executive selection rules.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Antaoris paused and continued: "However, when recommending candidates, there is a principle that must be followed. The candidate for regional chief executive must have a resume of town chief executive for more than four years!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This rule was discussed and determined by the elders at the last meeting. It is mainly to ensure that the elders elected as regional administrators have sufficient administrative experience. Of course, it also excludes becoming a Theonian elder after the Western Mediterranean War. The possibility of people wanting to become the regional chief executive.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   No matter how regretful some people felt, Antaoris raised his voice and continued: "I declare the election of the regional chief executive to begin!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   First of all, the first region to be nominated is Corsica. Do you have anyone to recommend?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, there is only one town in Corsica, Alenia, which includes eight or nine settlements with only a few hundred people. In terms of population and land area, it is not only far inferior to Crotone. , Cosenza, Catanai, and other large cities, and even medium-sized towns such as Silitine, Crimesa, and Udiae are not as good as each other. However, after it was divided into a region by Davos, this small half of the island In the eyes of some elders, it is much more important. After all, it is still a region no matter how small it is.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The etiquette officer scanned the venue, and among the eight elders who raised their hands, he chose the oldest one (this is also The new rules implemented by the Senate in recent years are that during meetings, senators cannot stand up and speak at will. They must raise their hands and be called out by the etiquette officer in order according to their age and seniority. This can avoid chaos in the venue to the greatest extent and improve the quality of the meeting. Efficiency): "Lord Stromboli!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stromboli stood up and said slowly: "I recommend Philocrates. Although he is relatively young, he has rich experience in government affairs. He once served as a scribe in the Kingdom's Household Registration Department. Oh, that was still in the Theonian Union. It should not be called a kingdom..." Stromboli deliberately emphasized the qualifications of the recommended candidates: "Court reporter, official of the Ministry of Construction... Administrator of Castellon, Administrator of Santa Ibinia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although he served as town administrator for only 5 years, he was the only kingdom administrator in the kingdom who managed a metal smelting center for a long time, and during the 4 years he governed St. Ibinia, its metal output and quality were at the top of the list. He has been improving year by year, and has been commended by His Majesty..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When he said this, he also stretched out his left hand to guide Davos in the center of the field.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos neither denied nor nodded to confirm, after all, he had promised before He would not interfere in the selection of the regional chief executive, so he had to try to remain calm and not let his random actions mislead the elders present.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "For a region like Corsica that is also dominated by metal smelting, I think the Philippines Locrates is the best choice!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Stromboli looked around and finished his last sentence very confidently.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Five of the seven senators who raised their hands just now quietly lowered their arms, not because they felt that Philocrates was indeed Corsi. The best candidate for the governor of the Chia region, but because they felt his determination to support Philocrates from Stromboli's words.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stromboli was the Senate Amendor after Cornelus. The leader of the Lara faction, Amendolara is only a small city with a small population, but it occupies an important position in the Kingdom of Theonia because it was occupied by King Davos after he led the mercenaries to Magna Graecia. The first town of Amendolara, the early citizens of Amendolara played an important role in the development of the entire Kingdom of Theonia, such as Cornerus, Laphias, Scombras, Strom Polis, Tritodemus, and Protesilaus all occupied important positions in the Senate.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although to this day, Scombbras, Cornelus, and Protesilaus have all occupied important positions in the Senate.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He passed away, but the Amendolara people were the first to join the political arena of the kingdom. In addition, Stromboli and other senators also liked to support Amendolara's underachievers. In these years, those who really participated in the political arena of the kingdom from a young age and gradually rose to the rank of senators Among them, the Amendolara people accounted for a large proportion.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What is more noteworthy is that more than half of the mercenaries at that time settled in Amendolara, and many of them married Amendolara women and even adopted many Amendolara women. Lara orphans are adopted sons and daughters, so some military veterans can also be said to be Amendolara people. As long as their interests do not conflict and there is no special instruction from Davos, they will firmly support the Amendolara senators. proposal.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition, because the Amendolara people were the first to join Theonia, and after long-term contact, they also have good relations with the elders of other factions, especially Cornelus, who has a gentle personality and has helped many people. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, these senators realized that they could not compete with the overwhelming number of Amendolara faction, so they voluntarily gave up in order to avoid offending this protective old man.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But Stromboli did not relax because he heard the ceremonial officer shouting Said: "Lord Vespa!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This old guy!" Stromboli couldn't help but cursed secretly when he saw Vespa standing up tremblingly not far away.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since Weisba resigned from the position of rotating chairman, he rarely attended Senate meetings due to old age and frailty. This was his reappearance within half a year, and he was obviously well prepared.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I recommend Damabas. Although he is younger among the senators, he has considerable qualifications in Theonian politics. Not long after His Majesty arrived in Italy, he became a warrior under His Majesty's command at the age of only 17. , made great achievements in the battle to capture Niutum and repel Crotone. However, he was injured in the battle to capture Grumentum and had to retire from the army and turned to administration... &#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   We all know that before Cosija, Sardinia, southern Iberia and a small part of Etruria belonged to the kingdom, there were two main metal deposits in the kingdom - the copper mines of Thurii and the Gel An iron mine in the mountains west of Lumentum.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Damabas had served as the director of the iron mine for 5 years, one year more than Philocrates. He had rich experience in managing mines. During those years Under his management, the iron mines continued to provide the kingdom with enough iron ore and preliminary smelted iron ingots, ensuring that our army soldiers could have a large number of relatively cheap weapons, contributing to the expansion of the kingdom. "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Having said this, Vespa coughed a few times and looked at Stromboli with a calm expression, but his words were aggressive: "I think that to become the regional administrator of Corsica, you must not only have the ability to manage mines , but also have strong ability to govern and assimilate foreign races! You must know that half of the city of Alenia is Phoenician, and a small half of the territory in the north of Corsica is occupied by the Etruscans, so A new regional administrator is needed who can handle relations well with our close neighbors and allies, the Etruscans.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Damabas served as administrator of Poseidonia for three years and as administrator of Pompeii for three years. , the political achievements were recognized by the senators, and the people of these two towns were of various races, and they were also close to the allies (the northeastern part of the Poseidonian territory borders the Abenirum territory in the Samnite Mountains, and Damabas just When he took office as its administrator, the Western Mediterranean War had just begun, and Abenirum was only an ally of Theonia, not a dominion), and Damabas handled it well, so I think he is Corsi The best candidate for the Chief Executive of the Jia District!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It sounds like the reasons listed by Weispa are more sufficient, but his volume is not enough, and his articulation is not clear enough. This is his consistent problem. Not only has he not changed as he gets older, but he has become worse. It is serious, so the effect of speaking is weakened a lot.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
