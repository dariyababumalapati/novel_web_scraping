   Chapter 1154: Changing Generals on the Move&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Davos' tone was calm, Aristiras still felt the sullenness on Davos' cold face. He lowered his head in fear and apologized: "Your Majesty, this is the negligence of the intelligence department! We did not It was found out in time and caused losses to the kingdom. Please be punished!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This is indeed your dereliction of duty!" Davos suddenly emphasized his tone and said seriously: "Although Proseus is anonymous, it is not easy to find out. , but if things are so easy, do you still need to set up your intelligence department? There are many foreign residents in Theonia, and many of them still hold important positions. Once someone has different intentions, it may cause great losses to the kingdom, so Your intelligence department should do its best to find out the past lives of these foreign citizens in important positions to ensure the security of the kingdom!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos paused for a moment, and his tone became softer again: "...the intelligence department used to You have made many meritorious deeds. This is the first time you have made a mistake. I will fine you half a year's salary as a warning to the Intelligence Department."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Thank you for your forgiveness, Your Majesty!" Aristelas said gratefully, feeling relieved.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Call Henepolis in for me on your way out."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes." Aristelas walked out of the chamber, feeling a chill on his back, and then realized that the Bolton he was wearing was soaked in cold sweat.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing Hernipolis walking in, the expression on Davos's face was much gentler than before: "Herni, send a warrant to the Ministry of Military Affairs."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay." Hernipolis immediately sat down in the office At the table, take out paper and pen.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Tell Alexis that there is no need to change the commander of the expedition to the Peloponnese for the time being. Proseus will still be the commander."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Henepolis was stunned and couldn't help but remind: "Your Majesty, Proseus But the Spartan prince is now renewing his old relationship with his former comrades. What if he-"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What if he doesn't carry out his mission seriously and even leads his army to rebel... You think so." Davos Taking over his words, he laughed, his face full of confidence: "Most of the soldiers who went on the expedition are citizens who have truly grown up in the territory of Theonia, and love and support the kingdom that nurtured them. Once Prosow If Sparta has evil intentions, he will only be abandoned by them, not to mention that there are Olivers, Trotilas, and Sekerian in the army! Today, the sun is about to set in Sparta, and in the kingdom Proseus, who has lived for many years and won a great reputation, should not give up everything here and turn to Sparta, which he has always hated!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos paused and then said: "Not to mention a dignified Sparta. Prince Bada actually served as the general of tens of thousands of soldiers in Theonia. If this news is known to the Greek city-states, it will not only demonstrate the power of Theonia, but also let them feel our magnanimity. Maybe it will have some special impact in mainland Greece..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "So that's it..." Henipolis nodded thoughtfully.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You can write another letter to Proseus in my name. The general meaning is... well, 'I completely trust him and ask him not to have any worries and continue to follow his own plan with Spar. I will give him my full support as before in the battle against Datong. After writing it, give it to me to sign, and then send it out as soon as possible."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, Your Majesty."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166; &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aristiras returned to the Ministry of Intelligence and immediately held a meeting to put pressure on his subordinates, demanding that the heads of each region must increase their efforts to conduct strict investigations on foreign citizens in their regions, especially those in the kingdom. Officials must thoroughly understand their background before coming to the kingdom, and severely punish anyone who makes mistakes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The meeting lasted until dark, when Aristelas adjourned the meeting.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When he returned home with his tired body, he found his wife smiling and looking very good.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This afternoon, Princess Kristoya called me over and said that I have worked hard during this period and helped her a lot (Asuna has been staying at Kristoia's house after her marriage to Aristelas). In the past two years, Kristoya has been busy taking care of her grandson, so she has devoted less energy to the Chamber of Commerce and relied more on Azuna to help Eunice.) In order to express her gratitude, she gave me a lot of property, a total of two A talent!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aristiras was stunned, and then thought of the half-year salary he had been deducted, and immediately realized whether this was King Davos's compensation for him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I originally didn't intend to accept it, and I declined it to the princess again and again, but the princess asked me, 'Has the villa your family built in Catania finished?' I thought, yes, we have spent all the money we have saved over the years. It's all been spent there, and there's still some balance that's in arrears..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Azuna kept talking nonstop, but Aristelas suddenly interrupted her and asked: "The matter in the villa is yours. Did you tell the princess?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I didn't. Didn't you ask me not to tell anyone?" Azuna's answer made Aristelas stunned again: Since the intelligence department changed from the dark to the open, he got After the kingdom was officially recognized, the number of affairs increased suddenly. As he got older and less energetic, he began to have some intention of quitting, so he bought land and built a villa at the foothills of the western edge of the Catania plain. In the future, I will be able to return to my hometown for retirement, but this matter has been carried out quietly, and no one has told it... How did His Majesty know?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aristelas suddenly felt a chill in his heart when he changed his mind.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A few days later, Davos once again received a letter from Leoticides, and this time he summoned Alexis, the minister of military affairs.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Alexis, Proseus wrote a letter requesting to resign as commander, and also requested to be transferred from the expedition to Sparta. What do you think about this matter?" Davos asked in a gentle tone. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alexis was stunned for a moment, and glanced at Davos's unsurprised and unhappy face, and thought: My opinion is not the same as what you just said, but it was rejected by you last time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course he would not say that, but frowned and said with a slight embarrassment: "Your Majesty, Proseus is not only the commander of the expedition to Sparta, but also the commander of the First Army. It is the main force of the battle. Now the army is in the war zone and may start a battle with the Spartan army at any time. At this critical moment, Proseus, as the commander-in-chief, asks to leave. This will not only weaken the morale and combat effectiveness of the army, but also It will seriously affect our success or failure in the Peloponnesian War!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked at him and said slowly: "However, Proseus confessed in the letter that as a Spartan, he missed his hometown and was unable to lead the army and fight the Spartans with all his strength. That's why we requested to be transferred back so as not to affect our war situation in Greece."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This is Proseus' fault!" Alexis said in a deep voice: "If he had confessed his true life experience to Your Majesty before the army set off, He will not fall into the current predicament. According to military law, he should accept some punishment!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ...Well, since Proseus has no desire to fight, staying there will only affect the battle, then Just transfer him back. Of course, it is also necessary to punish him. This matter will be discussed by your Ministry of Military Affairs in accordance with the "Military Law" and submitted to me for approval." Having said&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   this, Davos said seriously: " But... it is not easy for the kingdom to cultivate an excellent commander. After so many years of war, only you and Proseus can truly take charge of the battle on behalf of the kingdom." "Your&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Majesty, you are the kingdom. The best commander!" Alexis quickly interjected.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos smiled softly, then sighed softly, and said with emphasis: "Proseus can be forgiven for concealing his life experience, and he did not secretly collaborate with the enemy, and he took the initiative to confess... Well, yes The punishment should not be too severe."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alexis hesitated for a moment, and then responded: "Understood, Your Majesty."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos nodded with satisfaction, and then turned to another topic: "For the commander of the expeditionary force Do you have a candidate for the temporary successor to the commander of the First Army?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alexis did not answer immediately, but fell into deep thought.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos first signaled Henepolis, who was recording on the side, to ask someone to get some syrup, and then waited quietly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a while, Alexis raised his head and said: "Your Majesty, the soldiers of the First Legion are more arrogant and unruly than other legions. Its first captain was newly appointed last year. I'm afraid he has not yet fully matured in the legion." To establish prestige, if the temporary acting army commander is difficult to tame the soldiers, it will be difficult to fully exert the combat effectiveness of the First Army. The First Army is the main force in this battle, and its temporary army commander must be selected carefully..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Well..." Davos nodded in agreement.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   According to the "Theonian Military Law": If an abnormal situation occurs during war and the legion commander is unable to serve, the first captain can temporarily take over.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now that the first captain has been eliminated, there is no possibility of other captains taking over. Alexis did not mention the third captain Adoris, and Davos seemed to have completely forgotten.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I have a very suitable candidate - Ctissus. Does Your Majesty still remember him?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course I do. This is the first time I have heard of a team officer insisting on refusing to serve as legion commander." Davos smiled. , asked jokingly: "How many promotion appointments has he rejected in total?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This... I don't know, but Ctissus has served as the first captain of the First Legion for more than 10 years. There is no doubt that he is the leader of the kingdom. The longest-serving first captain in the army, his prestige among soldiers is sometimes even higher than that of the legion commander.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During the Western Mediterranean War, when Amyntas was the commander, he temporarily took charge of the battlefield command tasks of the First Army several times and performed very well..."&#13;
