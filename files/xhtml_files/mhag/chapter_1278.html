   Chapter 1278 The Princess's Request&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay, that's it, you will follow me to Persia!" At this time, Davos smiled, looked at the former Secretary of Commerce in the crowd, and said: "Mariji , you should be very happy to be able to return to your hometown soon, right?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mariji replied calmly: "Your Majesty, I have lived here for most of my life and am already a Theonian. The reason why I want to follow you to Persia , because I am relatively familiar with it, and I hope I can provide you with some good advice during the battle."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You are duplicity." Epithenes exclaimed from the side.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mariji's words reminded Davos, and he immediately asked: "Is Yizam among your group of people going to Persia?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, Your Majesty, he is the most active one to sign up. After all, he It can be regarded as returning to my hometown." Felicius replied with a smile.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alexis immediately understood the meaning of Davos' words and answered: "He should be at home now. Do you need to call him right away?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Don't worry, I will have time later." Davos looked at everyone, He sighed and said: "It's been a long time since we old brothers got together! Today, don't be in a hurry to go back. I'll send someone to pick up Matonis, Olivers, and Alps in Turui. All the old former mercenaries are called over. I will hold a banquet in the palace and we can have a good chat, okay?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Great!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Thank you, Your Majesty!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166; &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Late at night, after the banquet, Davos returned to the palace on King's Hill.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When he came to the backyard, he found that the main building hall in front was brightly lit with candles, which was very strange.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When he walked in, he saw the two princesses Christoya and Agnes sitting in the huge living room. He was drunk and asked: "It's so late, why don't you two... go to bed?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   " Your Majesty, we are waiting for you." Christoya said angrily.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Wait for me? Uh...what's the matter?" Davos burped.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agnes immediately went over to help him sit down, and then brought him a cup of hot honey water that had been prepared. At the same time, she asked with concern: "We heard that your Majesty will personally lead the army to attack Persia this time. Is this true? "?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos held her hand and comforted softly: "Don't worry, you two. Persia's national power is obviously weakened now. We are fully capable of defeating it completely and making it no longer a hidden danger to the kingdom... Uh, Besides, this time it is a war between the two great powers of Theonia and Persia. Almost all the legions of the kingdom will be dispatched. If I don't fight in person, I won't worry!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos squeezed Agnes's hand lightly and looked at it. Xiang Krystoya's tone became gentler: "Don't worry, this is the last time I will lead troops into battle. After this war is over, I will stay with you and won't worry you two anymore. !"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty." Kristoya was a little moved, but the look on her face quickly turned serious: "In the past, when you led troops to war, my sister and I could only wait at home, but this time you are going to Persia. We have already agreed to go with you!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What?!" Davos was half sober. He looked at Christoya and Agnes next to him, feeling a little unbelievable. Asked: "Are you kidding?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty!" Christoya straightened her chest and said in a strong tone: "Agnes and I have been discussing it all day today, and now we are making this request with a very serious attitude. , I hope you will take it seriously!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay." Davos let go of Agnes's hand, sat up straight, coughed lightly, and said in a deep voice: "I don't agree!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing Kelly Stoya turned around, and Davos went on to explain: "I formulated the "Theonia Military Law". It is precisely because of its strict implementation that the army has been able to win again and again. Today, A powerful kingdom. Article 91 of the Military Law specifically stipulates, 'Generals and soldiers are not allowed to march or fight with their families, and are not allowed to rob women. Violators will be punished by beheading!' Do you want me to be beheaded?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even if no one dares to do this Yes, but as the maker of military law and the commander-in-chief of the entire army, I have violated military law. Will the soldiers below seriously abide by it? Once this bad start is made, military discipline will eventually be ruined, and will the army still be able to win the war? ?!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agnes was a little moved, and she looked at Crystal.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kristoya was unmoved: "Military law stipulates that women are not allowed to march with the army? So aren't the nurses in the various legion medical camps women?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos retorted without thinking: "They are not women, they They are soldiers. Over the past few decades, the soldiers have no longer treated them as women. They have become part of each legion."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kristoya said with a smile: "Speaking of the nurses in this medical camp, I still follow your Majesty's instructions. I was the captain of the nurses at the time, and now I can serve again -" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is absolutely not possible!" Davos said firmly: "You two are now the princesses of the Kingdom of Theonia, She is the mother of a country in the hearts of the people. She is no longer what she was a few decades ago. Taking a job in a medical camp will only disrupt the normal order of the medical camp and affect their work efficiency! What is more important is your safety. Without protection, if something happens to you, can I still command the battle with peace of mind!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty." Christoya's eyes suddenly turned red and she said with a bit of sob: "I followed you from Persia to Magna Graecia. I haven't returned to my hometown for decades. I once heard business people in Asia Minor say that since Persia regarded the kingdom as an enemy, I don't know how I learned that I was born in Miletus, although my father suffered a lot from the Persians because of Cyrus's rebellion. Punishment... He died 10 years ago, but this time the Persians killed my father's family... hundreds of people, including neighbors... were either killed or made into slaves..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Jingying Tears flowed down from her well-maintained white cheeks, but her voice became a little sharp: "Your Majesty, I swear in the name of Hades, this time I must go to Miletus in person, and kill everyone who participated in the killing." The Persians in my family and all Milesian accomplices must be punished! I will also try my best to find all the surviving tribesmen and let them settle down again and live a prosperous life. This is what I owe them!... "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos was silent: in fact, he had already learned about the massacre of the Christoya family from the intelligence obtained by Aristelas five years ago. In order not to make his wife sad, he hid it. Unexpectedly, Kristoya already knew it, but she has been suffering in silence... If her father was retaliated by the King of Persia because of his involvement in Cyrus's rebellion, it can also be said that it had nothing to do with Theonia, and the destruction of his family But it was actually Davos's fault. Now that Crystal swore in the name of God, it was clear that her attitude was firm.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   If Davos still objects, it will undoubtedly cause a rift in the relationship between husband and wife that has lasted for decades, so he hesitated.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, Agnes spoke up: "Your Majesty, do you think this is okay? My sister and I will not go to Persia with the army to avoid embarrassment for you. When the war goes well, we will go with the baggage fleet..." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is still the case. It's a bit dangerous..." Facing the expectant and pleading eyes of the two wives, Davos finally compromised: "Okay, I will arrange this... But, Christoya, if you leave, who will be your chamber of commerce? Responsible? And Agnes, who will be in charge of the Hera Temple?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Eunice is now able to take charge of her own business. When I leave, of course she will manage the Chamber of Commerce."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Cynthia will be in charge of the daily life of the Hera Temple for me. Sacrifice."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Where are Little Chris and the others? Are you willing to leave them alone?" Davos tentatively made a final effort.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kristoya said firmly: "I'm not their mother, so why would I be reluctant to part with it."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing the two wives' resolute attitudes, Davos lowered his head and slowly took a sip of honey water, and then said: "This way Well...after the entire western Asia Minor is conquered, I will notify the Ministry of Military Affairs and send troops to take you to Miletus. After the affairs of Miletus are dealt with, you two will return, okay?" "No!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Chris Toya immediately objected: "If you conquer Persia this time, Agnes and I will go to Babylon with you!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos was stunned: "Why are you going to Babylon?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agnes hesitated and said nothing. , Kristoya was quite straightforward: "I heard that the Persian king has many women. We are afraid that you will marry another one, so we have to keep an eye on it!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos Oran: "What are you thinking about? How could I do this? Such a violation of military law! Besides, I'm already this old, so how can I have such thoughts!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kristoya curled her lips: "Who knows, it is said that the Persian king was already old, and he married himself My daughter, my sister and I will follow you to prevent you from making mistakes!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos shook his head helplessly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the Persians in Asia Minor successively obtained "Theonia declared war on Persia and formed a Greek coalition, "We are going to attack Persia", but at the same time, they also noticed that the people of the Greek city-states were preparing to harvest the farmland that was about to be harvested and had not started military mobilization. Therefore, they all believed that the Greek coalition's attack would not come too early. As a result, Dai The 10th Aulian Army successfully landed on the beaches of Bosmecia on the east coast of the Hellespont Strait.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, even if Theo Pampus, the governor of Mysia, was prepared, he would not be able to prevent the landing of the Theonian army. At most, he would only cause some trouble for the Tenth Army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
