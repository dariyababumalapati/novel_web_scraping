   Chapter 1090: Speech on Theonia&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Well said!" Ancitalus's loud admiration did not interrupt Plato's desire to continue speaking: "Dear King Davos, you once criticized me in "The Republic" He said, "I only see city-state citizens in my eyes, and despise slaves and foreigners." This time, whether traveling in the south or north of Theonia, what I saw and heard shocked me greatly!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Rome !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   People, Phoenicians, Samnites, and even Volscians who are not citizens of Theonia are all trying to speak Greek (Theonia), although most of them are still very stiff. I I also met several alien children many times who asked me questions... These all made me realize that even the completely ignorant and backward indigenous people can be educated to have the same wisdom and love for Greek culture as us, and those who are both illiterate can , but are unwilling to make changes, they are the ones who should really be despised by us!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plato took another sip of wine, increased his voice again and said: "When I first met with you, the king, I once praised You are the real philosopher king. Now I find that this statement is not completely correct. This time, I stayed in Rome, Benetum, and Lilibi for a while, and carefully observed the Theonian officials. Regarding the governance of the towns under their jurisdiction, although these towns have different situations and different environments, one thing is the same - the Theonian officials there are performing their duties very seriously and responsibly, and they are all following Theonian regulations. The laws of Nigeria govern the towns under their jurisdiction, and according to what I have observed, they are all governed well and the administrative efficiency is very high...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I once said, 'When people are sick, they need to find professional doctors, and merchants need to transport goods by sea. We know how difficult it is to find experienced captains to govern a city-state well, but let inexperienced but selfish citizens of the city-state participate extensively. How can the city-state develop well! But there are many This is what the Greek city-states did!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And as far as I know, the senior officials of various towns in Theonia were promoted through step-by-step experience. They have enough experience and wisdom to deal with and solve the problems encountered by the towns. All kinds of difficult problems, this is what you once told me about "merit selection". So, I need to change the sentence I said, "Not only King Davos, you are a true philosopher, you Many of his officials are also philosophers. It is under your governance that Theonia is as powerful as it is today!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Dear Platonic scholar." Davos, who is in a high position, has listened to Tai Nian over the years. He has become accustomed to compliments, but being praised by a great man who was called the "Father of Western Philosophy" in his previous life still made him feel a little proud. He showed a pleasant smile on his face and tried his best to be humble and said: "Are you here today just to praise Theonia?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Since Theonia has done well, why not praise it!" Plato raised his glass and said loudly: "Come on, let us praise it together. Theonia!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos smiled and raised his glass.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After finishing the drink with the others, Plato shook his head, as if to get rid of the drunkenness. He squeezed his face hard, and then said: "Dear King Davos, do you remember Aesop?" Crates?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Of course I remember." Davos said with a puzzled look on his face: "A famous orator and rhetorician in Athens. We invited him to give speeches at the first and second Greek Scholars Congress. But when I invited him again, he refused to come again. I once thought it was because we did not take good care of her during the previous reception, so he was dissatisfied." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Your Majesty, although Isocrates is a strict man and does not love He talks a lot, but he is not a person who likes to care about this." Lysias, who has lived in Athens for many years and had close contacts with Isocrates, explained: "According to what I know, he also Athens built a school, and he has been busy teaching students in the past few years, so he may not have time to come to Thurii to attend the conference." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Oh, that's right, he also built a school." Davos Rao Looking at Plato with interest, he asked: "Isn't that competition with your school?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plato said frankly: "My school and Isocrates' school have different training goals. His school pays more attention to Teaching students how to use words and sentences, how to make speeches, and how to better conduct public political life... is more practical. My Akademi is more focused on studying the political system of city-states and exploring how to build a more perfect country... ...But it is true that there is a certain amount of competition between our two colleges. Just last year he and I had a debate."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Oh?" Davos looked surprised, but in fact he not only knew about the debate , and a rough record of this debate is still stored in his mansion.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This debate is also related to your Theonia." Plato said seriously: "I think one of the main reasons why Isocrates has not agreed to your invitation to attend the Scholars Conference in recent years is that he Thinking that the existence of the Kingdom of Theonia is a huge threat to the Greek mainland-"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "How is this possible-" Lysias was a little surprised, but before he finished speaking, he was picked up by Ansitanos: "For I can also prove this. In the fourteenth year of the kingdom (380 BC), our war with Carthage had just begun. At the 99th Olympian Games, Isocrates delivered a speech "All "Dedicated to the Greek Gala", the main content is to call on the Greek city-states to stop the war, unite, and unite to fight against the outside world, restore the glory gained by the Greek ancestors in the Greco-Persian War, complete their unfinished business, and liberate those enslaved under Persian rule. Greek compatriots in Asia Minor, any Greek who negotiates peace with Persia or even is bewitched by Persia into civil war should be cursed...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But later in this speech, he also mentioned... Well, the original text said this... '&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Today We gather in Olympia to thank Zeus for blessing the Greeks, but we should be able to feel that compared with a few decades ago, this event has become much deserted, not only because of the war, but also because there are fewer city-states participating. Tarantum, Crotone, Locri, Thurii, Syracuse, Agrigento...these colonial city-states in the Western Mediterranean, the vanity and shallowness their people showed at previous events It is true that we despise them, but without them at the event, we will feel lonely. They were originally members of our Greek family, but now they have become towns under the Kingdom of Deoria one by one&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   . Is Onia a country of Greeks?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   They were never seen in Olympia, Pythia, Nemea, or the Isthmian Games, and Delphi did not set up a holy treasury for them. This shows that the priests who represent the wishes of the gods have The attitude of this Western Mediterranean kingdom is not only because there are too many barbarian citizens in its country, but also because it distorts our understanding of gods! Theonia believes that Hades is the lord of the gods instead of Zeus, he also allows citizens to believe in the gods of foreigners. Can Theonia, which can do such terrible things, not be called a Greek country! Of course, the citizens of Theonia under the influence of this wrong concept cannot be like We become Greeks of the same faith!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But why don't we protest against their wrong practices or even send troops to intervene?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Because Theonia is very powerful, the powerful strength it has gathered by annexing many Greek colonial city-states can actually force Naples, which is still an independent city-state and has a relatively strong national power, to not dare to participate in this event, just because of fear of Theonia Will be dissatisfied with it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When we were instigated by the Persians and killed each other for our own interests, Theonia, which annexed our sub-states and colonial cities in the Western Mediterranean, had swelled into a huge kingdom, although it has not so far It has not shown any malice towards us, but it is so different from us and so close to us. Once a conflict occurs, the consequences will be serious!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   O wise Greeks!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   To the east of us are our enemies, the Persians, who have never given up on enslaving us. To the west, our immediate neighbor is a powerful kingdom whose thoughts we cannot fathom. Our situation is so dangerous, shouldn't we abandon our prejudices? , just like we did in the face of the invading Persian army decades ago, reunite to defend our homeland and regain the glory of our ancestors...'" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Why didn't I know there was such a speech?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Lysias was very surprised after hearing this.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Because Thebes and Athens were already at war with Sparta at that time, and neither side dared to offend Persia or us, so as not to cause changes in the war situation, so they both intentionally prohibited this. The popularity of this speech was due to the fact that officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spent a lot of effort to obtain the manuscript when they were on a mission to Greece.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Ansitanos explained: "It can be seen from this speech that Isocrates regards us Theonia as a potential threat to the Greek mainland.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since your victory over Carthage, and starting last year, Isocrates has regarded Theonia as a real threat to the Greek mainland and to Athens. Not only has he often promoted his view to students, but he has also I gave a speech at the citizens' assembly to remind the people. Since I attended the Greek Scholars Assembly for the first time, I have written many articles that positively discussed the political system of the Kingdom of Theonia, and suggested that the Greek city-states headed by Athens can learn from it. At one time, many citizens of Athens, and even people from other city-states such as Thebes and Corinth, rushed to copy and circulate it..." Plato said seriously: "So Isocrates thinks that I am a supporter of the Kingdom of Theonia and must Only by refuting me in public can the citizens of Athens understand me.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The title of this chapter refers not only to Isocrates' speech, but also to Plato's praise of Theonia.&#13;
