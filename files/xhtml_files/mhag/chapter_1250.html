   Chapter 1250 Prince Philly of Macedonia&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Cloto." Davos directly called his son by his nickname and said happily: "I am very happy that you have such filial piety! But... I am the same as Amyntas and the others. I have had such an expectation in my heart for decades, do you also want me to go to the Elysee with regrets?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax was stunned and didn't know how to answer.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos smiled and said: "Don't worry. Decades ago, I led the mercenaries to fight in Persia for more than a year. I never fell ill once and was completely adapted to the climate and food there. Although I am old now, But you have never stopped exercising, you rarely get sick, and your body is still in great shape, right?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Yes, Your Majesty. According to our medical school's comprehensive analysis of your previous physical examinations, the functions of your body's various organs and your healthy middle age People are the same," Medical Minister Stacey Kordas said matter-of-factly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Klotto, did you hear that? Maybe my physical condition is better than yours!" Davos laughed, and then said firmly: "Everyone, I am already 60 years old. I have been in the military all my life. I have won countless victories, and this will be my last battle! Let me eliminate this last powerful enemy for the Holy Kingdom of Theonia that we jointly established!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotoka Tax continued to say. Stopped, and finally sighed helplessly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The ministers looked at each other, and no one objected.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, Sedorum stood up and asked: "Your Majesty, you are leading an expedition. How will the government affairs of the kingdom be arranged?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos was already prepared. He said slowly: "The consul Clotokatax will act as the agent. In terms of national affairs, you assistant ministers will give you your full assistance. In fact, this is how the Kingdom's Administrative Office has been run in the past few years. I believe you can do better after my expedition!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   No one raised objections to Davos's arrangement, and some even It is believed that five years ago, His Majesty Davos appointed his son Clotokatax as the consul and began to handle the affairs of the government. Maybe at that time, he had already thought of conquering Persia personally.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Everyone, today's meeting has determined the resolution of the expedition to Persia. Afterwards, we will have in-depth discussions on this and make some secret preparations." Davos looked around the crowd and said solemnly: "But - in order to ensure that the next The successful holding of the sports meeting will not be announced to the public for the time being. I hope everyone will abide by the laws of the kingdom and do not leak this matter!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, Your Majesty!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the executive meeting, Davos returned to his office and had just sat down Before he could take a sip of syrup, Henepolis came in and reported: "Your Majesty, Aristelas wants to see you."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Let him come in."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aristelas walked forward slowly and said respectfully salute.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Aris, if you are here to ask me about the resignation you submitted last time -" Davos looked at him and said softly: "I will not agree for the time being... You heard it at the meeting just now, I We will personally conquer Persia, so the stability of the kingdom still needs your help and your hard work for a while, what do you think?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Your Majesty, I agree." Aristelas answered simply: "But I have one more thing I will report to you."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Very good, you say."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Prince Philly of the Kingdom of Macedonia, whom you asked the intelligence department to focus on, was discovered by the intelligence officer in Thessaly among the Macedonian envoys and was coming to Thurii. On the way."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Middling among the Macedonian envoys?" Davos thought: "You mean he didn't come to the games as a Macedonian prince? Even his mother and brother didn't know that he had left Macedonia?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now You should know." Aristelas explained: "I then received a secret report from Thessaly. Not long after the Macedonian envoys left by boat, the Macedonian Royal Guards were in the city of Aegae. Search for his traces. I estimate that Macedonia will soon send another envoy to Tulii to find their envoy group, strengthen the protection of Fili, and may not even rule out letting Fili reveal his identity..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos understood. The reason why Aristelas conducted such a detailed analysis of the whereabouts of a Macedonian prince was actually due to his original request for the Ministry of Intelligence to closely monitor such a little Macedonian prince who had nothing to do with the Kingdom of Theonia. Bad guess.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In 369 BC (the 25th year of the Kingdom of Theonia), when the Theonian army conquered Thessaly and established the New Greek Alliance, King Amyntas of Macedon, the neighbor to the north of Thessaly, died of illness. His eldest son, Alexander, who was still young, succeeded to the throne.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Immediately afterwards, a noble general in northern Macedonia launched a rebellion and occupied the area near Chalcidica. Alexander sent troops to quell the rebellion and suffered a failure.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The rebels moved south and approached the palace of Aegei. The situation was so critical that King Alexander had to send a messenger to Athens for help.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Macedonia and Sparta were once allies, and Alexander should have asked Sparta for help, but he heard that Sparta was now controlled by the Holy Kingdom of Theonia, and there were rumors in Macedonia that the King of Theonia and Macedonia The people were in panic due to the murder of their father, and the young Macedonian king was also afraid, so he had to ask for help from Iphicrates of Athens, because this famous Athenian general had close relations with Macedonia, and the former Macedonian king Amyntas was also his 's adoptive father.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Iphicrates received the request for help, he indeed made suggestions to the Executive Committee of the Athenian Generals. However, Callistratus reminded everyone that although the newly established New Greek League did not restrict the members of the alliance from using troops externally, Athens had to send troops to fight against the enemy. Macedonia, which is adjacent to Thessaly, will inevitably arouse the suspicion of Theonia, so it is best to get Theonia's permission.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although everyone was unwilling to do so, they finally agreed to Callistratus's suggestion and sent messengers to the New Hellenic League Council in Thurii.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Davos got the news, he immediately ordered the troops stationed in Thessaly to rescue the Macedonian royal family and repel the rebels.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But while the messenger was traveling back and forth, the Macedonian rebels captured the city of Aigai, King Alexander was killed in battle, and the queen fled to the south of the Gulf of Telma with the king's two younger brothers, Perdiccas and Philly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hilos, the administrator of Thessaly region, sent an envoy to find the Queen of Macedonia and conveyed to her the goodwill of King Theonia towards Macedonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Queen of Macedonia finally put down her guard, asked Theonia for help, and was willing to let Macedonia join the Greek Alliance.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, the Theonian envoy euphemistically stated that if Macedonia wants to join the New Greek Alliance, it must obtain the consent of more than half of the city-states in the Greek Alliance, which will take a lot of time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But if Macedonia only forms an alliance with Theonia, just like the nature of the alliance with Sparta, then the alliance can be signed immediately, and the Theonian army in Thessaly can immediately send troops.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The desperate Queen of Macedon had no choice but to agree to the envoy's request, sign an alliance with Theonia, and serve Theonia as the master.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The border legions in Thessaly were immediately ordered to go north, defeated the rebels near the city of Pella, and continued to pursue them. Finally, they captured and killed the Macedonian general who started the rebellion, and recaptured the town occupied by him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   With the full support of Theonia, the Amyntas family regained the kingship, and Alexander's second brother Perdiccas became the king of Macedonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During the entire process of quelling the chaos, Alexander's queen and new king saw the power of Theonia, and thought of the grudge between King Theonia and Macedonia, so they decided after discussion: Send their third brother Philip to Turi Yi, as a hostage to show Macedonia's loyalty to Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Davos learned the news, he expressed his rejection very clearly, and wrote a letter to comfort Pardix personally, saying, "As long as Macedonia remains loyal to Theonia, Theonia will always guarantee The Amyntas family has long-term stability in Macedonia, so there is no need for any hostages to maintain the friendship between the two countries."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Perdiccas was extremely moved after reading the letter, but he would never know the reason why Davos did not accept Macedonia. Philili was sent to Thurii as a hostage mainly because he had some knowledge of the history of the rise of Macedonia in his previous life.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time in the previous life, Athens and Thebes successively interfered in the political situation of Macedonia. In the end, Macedonia surrendered to the more powerful Thebes. In order to ensure Macedonia's loyalty, Thebes forcibly took Prince Philip as a hostage. It is said that Philip After Li arrived in Thebes, he entered the military school founded by Ipamilonda, and he heard and witnessed Ipamilonda's military reforms in Thebes, as well as the high-level officials of Thebes headed by Pelopidas. Various resolutions implemented in the process of forming and integrating the Boeotian League... A few years later, due to civil strife in Macedonia, the 20-year-old young man returned to his homeland, usurped the throne of his nephew, and used him in What Thebes learned created a powerful new army that not only unified Macedonia but also made it stronger.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After that, his son Alexander destroyed Thebes, which had given Philip political and military enlightenment...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos planned for a rainy day, and of course he would not give such a chance to the talented Philip.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As for Macedonia's loyalty, it is not considered by Davos at all. He even hopes that Macedonia will betray the alliance. In this way, Theonia, which has been repaired for several years and has been integrated with Thessaly, can take the opportunity to destroy Macedonia. , allowing its territory in Greece to expand, and will strengthen the kingdom's power in Greece.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This Prince Philip is very troublesome!" At this moment, Davos said cautiously: "No matter whether the Macedonian envoys want to reveal his identity, but since he came to watch the sports meeting, he is Theonia's Distinguished guest, we must ensure his safety!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aristelas glanced at Davos secretly, feeling that his previous guess seemed to be wrong, and immediately said seriously: "Yes, Your Majesty, we will try our best to protect Philip. Safe!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
