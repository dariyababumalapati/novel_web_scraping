   Chapter 1201 Bad News&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A glimmer of hope ignited in everyone's dim eyes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, Agesilaus sighed secretly in his heart: Even if they finally recaptured Sparta, would those Piliasians and Helots who had already tasted the sweetness be willing to accept their rule again?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the evening, Davos dragged his tired body back to his mansion.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Dinner was the most lively time for the Davos family, but today Davos didn't talk much. Even though Eunice took the initiative to raise topics with her father several times, his answers seemed perfunctory.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the meal, Davos called Crystal and Agnes to the master bedroom on the second floor.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, has something happened to Cloteau?!" It's rare for Crystal to see Davos showing such an ugly expression, and in addition, these days she has been worried about Clotoka's expedition. kes, so I felt intense uneasiness in my heart.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos let out a long sigh: "It's not Croto, it's Adoris... He has already gone to Elysee..." The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   first sentence made Christoya breathe a sigh of relief, and the latter sentence made her worry again. : "Adoris?! How could it be?! He has always made people so reassuring, and he is so strong, and he has become the captain... How-"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos sighed again, and said in a heavy tone: "Croto led the army in a decisive battle with the main Spartan army. The Spartans attacked fiercely. The brigade led by Adoris was the focus of the attack. He ended up suffering from many battle wounds..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Keli Stoya was stunned for a moment, and suddenly cursed: "What is Croto doing! As the commander of the army, why doesn't he take more care of his brother! Has he forgotten what Adoris has done over the years? Take care of him! -"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Sister!" After all, Agnes came in late, and had a cold personality. She didn't have a deep feeling for Adoris, so she could still keep calm after hearing the news. She sat down He went to Christoya's side, held her trembling hand tightly, and comforted softly: "Klotto and Adoris have a deep friendship, and it is impossible not to take care of his brother. I'm afraid this is an... accident, right?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos nodded and whispered: "King Agesilaus of Sparta was a cunning opponent. He formulated an insidious battle plan, which once caused the First Army to fall into chaos and almost caused our army to fall into disarray. The entire battle was defeated. Fortunately, Croto handled it well and finally won the battle... The entire army led by Adoris was almost completely destroyed, which was the biggest loss in this battle!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But... how should I face it? To Cynthia, to Aedui and the child!" Christoya shed tears and sobbed: "Since Adoris left on his own, I haven't cared much about him. I'm not a good mother..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Dai Firth gently pressed his wife's shoulder and said with some emotion: "No, you have always been a good mother to Adoris, raising him carefully... On the contrary, I have never truly accepted him as a human being. My own child was too harsh on him. Now that I think about it... I really regret it!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kristoya looked at her husband with tearful eyes. She wiped her tears and comforted her: "Your Majesty, you don't have to blame yourself. Teaching children is our woman's job,&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   and you are so busy..." Christoya's words could not alleviate the guilt in Davos's heart. He shook his head, stood up, and said: "Agnes, you Stay here with Kristoya while I go for a walk."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It's so late, where are you going?" Agnes asked with concern.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Stand on the cliff and look at the Kraty River."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos was really standing on the hill, overlooking the Kraty River in the evening.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He still remembered that when he first moved to this hill more than ten years ago, it was dark all around at night, and the whirlpool of the river reflected the moonlight, making it look particularly deep. Coupled with the rumbling sound of waves coming from the downstream, it always gave people a sense of darkness. Feeling of palpitations.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, now, not only the lights on both sides of the Craty River are twinkling like the stars in the sky, but the lights in the river are also connected into a patch, swaying on the river. It is the ships entering the river port under the guidance of the lighthouse, as well as some Dionis Asian businessmen specially built a restaurant on the river with a customized cruise ship... The bustle and bustle have replaced the desolation and silence of the past. This is what Davos has created through decades of hard work, and it is also the change he has made to the world.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thinking of these, a surge of pride rose from the bottom of his heart, dispelling Davos's original guilt.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The news of "The Theonian army conquered Sparta" quickly spread throughout Greece, shocking and trembling many city-states. It also prompted some city-states to speed up the pace of joint resistance.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Because the Corinthians were active participants in the war between Theonia and Sparta, they were even attacked by the Theonian fleet against merchant ships in the port. Therefore, the angered Corinthians were the first to join the anti-Theonia alliance. One of the city-states, now it is very likely to become the next target of attack by the Theonian army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The anxious Corinthians carried out urgent military mobilization and asked for help from friendly countries.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Argos has been hesitant during this war. In addition to not wanting to help its mortal enemy Sparta, another important reason is that the Theonian envoy Carias once proposed to the Argos Council, "As long as they support the Theonian Onia, after the war, Theonia will take their Tetia that was captured by Sparta a hundred years ago (not Tegea in the Arcadia region, but located in the northeastern corner of Sparta's territory, A small city adjacent to the territory of Argos) was returned to Argos."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Argives were tempted, but soon swayed under the lobbying of the eloquent Athenian envoy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Later, as a close neighbor of Sparta, the Argives discovered that after the Theonians occupied Sparta, they completely abolished Sparta's original political system and turned both the Pileas and the Helots into Becoming a new citizen of Sparta... Everything in Sparta has changed except the land.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This frightened Argos, who was also an oligarchy, and they finally decided to join the anti-Theonian alliance, strengthening the defense of the border while reinforcing the friendly ally Corinth.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Athenians had already been conducting military mobilization. After learning that the Theonian army had completely occupied Sparta, the Athens Council felt even more urgent and repeatedly urged its overseas allies and sub-states to send reinforcements and supplies to Athens as soon as possible because Generals such as Callistratus knew that with the fall of Sparta and the strong performance of Theonia, if Athens did not step forward and raise its arms, many city-states that were not determined would probably be destroyed. Fall to Dioria.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, Athens quickly formed an army of 10,000 men, led by Iphithrax, and went all the way to support Corinth with great fanfare.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Thebes and its allies learned that Theonia had captured Sparta, they strengthened their determination to remain neutral.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   To the west, the city-states of Phocis and Locris were influenced by the Delphi priests and actively responded to Athens' call. They sent a total of 6,000 soldiers to join the Athenian army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sparta was completely defeated, and Pisa no longer had strong support. Even without the previous commitment, it was inevitable that it would eventually attach itself to Ellis in the same area. Ellis, who had previously shown hostility to Theonia, began to hesitate. Undecided, because after Messenia and Sparta were occupied by Theonia and the Arcadian Alliance became an alliance of Theonia, Ellis, located in the northwest corner of the Peloponnese Peninsula It has been completely surrounded by Theonia and its allies, so when other city-states that joined the anti-Theonia alliance took active actions, it somewhat died down.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the Theonian army gave Tegea to Mantinia, other city-states in the Arcadian Alliance hoped that Mantinia would return Tegea territory and joined them in persuading the Theonian army. Spare the captive people of Tegea and allow them to return home.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   How could the Mantinians spit out the fat they had swallowed? Lycomedes, who initially expressed opposition, finally changed his tune and defended the interests of Mantinians in the face of the surging public opinion.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The two sides argued endlessly, and some city-states even threatened to "leave from the alliance." At this moment, the news came that "the Theonian army occupied the entire territory of Sparta" and the quarrels in the Arcadian Alliance quickly stopped. , and quickly reached an agreement: send an envoy to Sparta to congratulate the ally Theonia and understand its handling of Sparta.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In Thessaly in northern Greece, Jason declared in Pharsalus: As a member of the Greek city-state, the Thessalians will never sit back and watch foreigners invade Greek land and bully their Greek compatriots!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He, Tagus of Thessaly, will lead all Thessalian warriors to drive away the invaders and help the compatriots in the south regain their homes!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After he issued the military mobilization, the city-states in Thessaly and the races in the surrounding mountainous areas sent troops one after another and gathered in Pharsalus&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ... ...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Within the territory of Persia, the entire western Asia Minor (now the Anatolia region of Turkey) was divided into many regions. Phrygia was one of them. It emerged as a kingdom hundreds of years ago. It was once in Asia Minor's influence and territory were enough to rival the Hittite Empire. Even though it has now become part of the Persian territory, it still retains its unique culture and some special rights.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Today's Phrygia is completely located in the center of western Asia Minor, It is not close to the sea at all, but when Pharnabazus was the governor of Phrygia, he used his prestige to rent the seaside town Aspendos in the Pisidia region in the south as the governor of Phrygia. The port, its military port is also located in it, and now Timothy serves as the commander of the fleet in this military port.&#13;
