   Chapter 1162: Meeting with Ipamironda&#13;
  </font>&#13;

 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Ahem!" When Adoris said this, Clotokatax was drinking soup, and he choked several times in a row. He responded with some embarrassment: "Brother, You underestimate me too much. I am the commander of the army. If I show favoritism to my own relatives, how can I command other soldiers to fight to the death? Don't worry, I won't do that!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Adoris looked at him and said again Once asked: "Really?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Really!" Crotokatax responded frankly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay!" Adoris picked up the soup bowl in his hand and said with great enthusiasm: "Using soup as wine, I wish us brothers to join forces and make brilliant achievements in Greece!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166; &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the new commander of the Theonian army has not arrived, Ipamironda stayed in Messenae for several days. Not only did he not complain, but on the contrary I am very happy, because Thebes is an ally of Theonia, so Ipamironda is not blindfolded and restricted from going out like Agesilaus. Except for some sensitive areas, he can stay in Messe Feel free to wander around the territory of Nia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In order to avoid misunderstandings, with the consent of Leoticides, staff officer Muklu also equipped him with a Theonian officer as a guide.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During this period of time, Ipamilonda not only carefully understood the entire operation of the new Messenian government from villages to towns, but also comprehensively observed the daily life of the Theonian army, starting from each brigade every morning. Organized morning exercises, rushing to the construction site to build cities and houses during the day, and at dusk, under the supervision of team officers, they returned to their military tents to rest...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He not only ran to the pass of Taygetos Mountain to watch the Theonian soldiers build He also went to the outpost tower to strengthen the defense against the Spartans; he also ran to the coast and watched the warships of the First Fleet patrolling and training in the Gulf of Messenia; he even watched the supply battalion use multiple camel teams to move from a simple The port transported food and supplies to the camp, cooked and distributed food to the soldiers in the camp, and medical rescues treated injured soldiers... Except for the engineering camp, which prohibited him from entering because it involved making some military equipment, he visited almost the entire camp. Again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Until this day, he received a notice from the team officer's guide: the new commander of Theonia wanted to see him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, he already knew the arrival of the new commander, because that day he rushed to the seaside and witnessed with his own eyes the entire process of another Theonia army of more than 10,000 people landing on the coast in countless ships and quickly gathering.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Entering the military tent, Ipamilonda nodded with a smile to five or six generals in uniform. Finally, he focused his eyes on the young man sitting in the middle, and then solemnly bowed and saluted: "Thebes The Si envoy Ipamilonda meets with the Theonian commander!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Please sit down, General Ipamilonda!" Clotokatax asked the soldiers to bring the wooden chairs that had been prepared, and was very polite. Said: "You are the military commander of the Boeotian Alliance, and you are also the hero who led the Boeotian Alliance to defeat the Spartans in the Battle of Leuctra. Your visit makes us feel honored!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ipamilon Da thanked the guards, sat down, and said humbly: "Leuctra's victory is indeed a great encouragement to the people of Thebes and Boiosia, but it is just like a person who often suffers from hunger after eating a He will feel very satisfied as if he had a full meal, but for someone who often eats full meals, this is nothing, and Theonia is a person who often eats full meals, am I right?! "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Epamironda's words made Ctissus, Olivers and others feel comfortable listening to them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "General, you are so humble!" Crotokatax said immediately: "When my father talked to me about the situation in Greece a few years ago, he mentioned you. He said that you and Pelopidas were Thebans. The most important pillar of Sri Lanka's rise, facts have proven that his judgment was correct!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hearing this, Ipamilonda's heart moved. Of course he knew who the other party's father was, and couldn't help but ask. One sentence: "I would like to ask when did His Majesty King Davos first mention me?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax thought for a while and said: "Hmm... It seems to be after the war with Carthage. , mentioned in a letter to me once... I was serving in Rome at that time, which was a town in the northern part of the kingdom."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the war between Theonia and Carthage... Ipamironda thought carefully about it : It was the most difficult period for Thebes. Facing Sparta's attack, it was struggling to hold on. Even some members of the Thebes government did not have much hope for the future, and those far to the west The King of Theonia firmly believed that Thebes would rise, and he also understood himself, who was unknown at the time. It can be seen that Theonia has long paid great attention to Thebes...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing that Ipa Milonda was silent, Speaking, Olivers interjected: "The great Davos is a descendant of the god Hades, and has been favored by the gods. Therefore, he can always make accurate judgments. The forces hostile to Theonia will eventually suffer Punishment for failure!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "That's right!" Ctissus and Tagetinos immediately agreed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Worried that the threat implicit in Olivers' words would displease Ipamilonda, Clotocatacus hurriedly took over the conversation and said: "If I had known, General, that you had come to Messenia, I would have arrived earlier." Come here so that you won't have to wait here for a few more days."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It doesn't matter. Staying here for a few more days has given me a deeper understanding of the Theonian army, and it has also made me feel deeply Why is the Theonian army so powerful? If your army is an adult, the armies of the Greek city-states, including ours in Thebes, are still children!" Ipamelonda said seriously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax was stunned for a moment, then smiled and said: "General Ipamilonda, you are too humble!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He did not continue to talk in depth on this issue, but instead asked: "General, what are you doing here this time?" Is it something important?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This time, on behalf of the people of Thebes and Boeotia, I would like to express my gratitude to our ally Theonia!" Ipamilonda looked solemn and said sincerely: "Thebes We have just become allies with Theonia. We haven't had much contact with each other in the past. This time Thebes's enemy is the most powerful city-state in Greece. What we originally only expected was that Theonia would be the most difficult time in the war. Nia was able to assist us with food and supplies, but to our surprise... you truly fulfilled the covenant, took the initiative to go to war with Sparta, and soon launched an attack on Sparta, just as the rumors said. As he said, 'Theonia is a country that keeps its promises,' Thebes is very lucky to be able to ally with Theonia!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After hearing these words, Clotokatax was very proud, and he tried his best to Do not let this emotion show up, but said humbly: "Keeping promises is the principle of the founding of Theonia, and sending troops to assist our allies when they are in danger is what we should do! It's just that Thebes can get out of trouble mainly by Your own efforts, it is precisely because the general led his army to defeat Sparta at Leuctra that it became easier for us to attack Sparta."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotokatax's words were also very frank, but Ipamilonda showed a grateful and helpless smile: "Leuctra's victory is indeed very important to Thebes, but it only temporarily makes Thebes Si was freed from the predicament, but Thebes fell into even greater trouble."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax glanced at Printors, and then showed a puzzled expression.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Epamironda explained seriously: "Athens and Thebes have been enemies for decades. Because of Sparta, it has only formed an alliance with Thebes in these years. It should be said that it has given Thebes a lot. A big help. But as the strength of Thebes gradually recovered, Athens' attitude towards us changed. When signing the Callias Contract, I clearly felt that Athens and Sparta had reached an agreement. Together we squeezed out Thebes. After the Battle of Leuctra, Athens even sent troops to garrison on the western border, clearly showing hostility to us.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Another of our allies, Jason of Thessaly, had previously attacked us. He also gave us a lot of help during the Spartan war, but after the Battle of Leuctra, he suddenly sent troops to occupy Thermopylae, and also carried out large-scale military mobilization in Thessaly, and threatened to send troops Going south, they also refused to receive the envoys we sent. All the city-states in western Central Greece, including our Thebes, were very nervous. Boiosia, dominated by Thebes, Phocis, dominated by Delphi, and Locris is already discussing how to unite to resist the invasion of the coming people..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Are the Thessalians strong in military strength?" Olivers couldn't help but ask. He, like Davos, is a Thessalian. , but it has been decades since he left Thessaly, and he does not know much about the current situation in his hometown. His impression of Thessaly is still that of the city-states fighting each other decades ago, which resulted in weak strength and frequent attacks by the indigenous people in the surrounding mountains. Bullying situations.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Since Jason, the tyrant of Philae, became Tagus of the Thessalians, all the city-states of Thessally were under his control. He could form at least an army of more than 30,000 people, and the combat effectiveness of the soldiers was still high. Not weak, this is a huge threat to us in Greece!" Ipamilonda reminded in a heavy tone.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "There is actually a Tagus in Thessaly!..." Olivers was a little surprised, and the words "an army of more than 30,000 people" also attracted the attention of the other army commanders.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax had received repeated instructions from Davos before leaving. Chief of Staff Printols could obtain more information from the Ministry of Military Affairs, so the two of them looked calm.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "After the Battle of Leuctra, we in Thebes suddenly faced threats from the north (Thessaly), east (Athens), and south (Sparta). The situation is quite dangerous! It is precisely because of you Dio Neia generously sent troops to reinforce Messenia, diverted the attention of the Spartans and Persians, and temporarily relieved Thebes from the greatest danger. We are grateful for this! Of course, I also want to ask for your forgiveness. , Thebes has to concentrate on dealing with the threat from the north, so it does not dare to send troops to join you to deal with the Spartans! I am very sorry for this!" At this point, Ipamilonda bowed his head. Waist, respectfully apologize to Crotokatax.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
