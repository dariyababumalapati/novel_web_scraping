   Chapter 1251 Cretan players participating in the Games&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "By the way, what has Ptolemy, the Macedonian regent who married the widow of Amyntas (the stepmother of Alexander, Perdiccas, and Phili) done recently?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Your Majesty. , I was about to report to you. The spies in Aigai discovered that for more than half a year, businessmen from Asia Minor have been coming in and out of Ptolemy's mansion from time to time." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Businessmen from Asia Minor..." Davos asked thoughtfully: " Are you saying that Ptolemy may have colluded with Persia?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aristelas said cautiously: "For fear of arousing Ptolemy's alert, the Intelligence Department did not conduct further detailed investigations on the Asia Minor businessman. However, during this period, Pablo The relationship between Dycas and Ptolemy was very tense. Perdiccas once publicly accused Ptolemy of taking too much power because he wanted to be king. Ptolemy also publicly retorted, "Perdiccas acted childishly." , rewards and punishments are unfair. Without his supervision, Macedonia would not know what kind of chaos it would be'...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It is reported that when Philli sneaked to Thurii, Perdiccas once suspected that his brother was kidnapped by Ptolemy, and he also Send a guard to inquire. I think if it weren't for the protection of our Theonia, the powerful Ptolemy might have rebelled." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   You are right. A few years ago, our army helped Macedonia put down the rebels. After that, the Intelligence Department found evidence that Ptolemy had colluded with the rebels, which showed that he had long been ambitious for the throne of Macedonia. He had only endured it because he was afraid of our Theonia. Now he dares to fight with Pardi Cass had a conflict and was no longer afraid of our Theonia interference. Who gave him the courage? It can only be Persia!" Davos finished speaking with certainty, and then reminded emphatically: "But as long as your intelligence department sends people Just keep an eye on him, don't worry about the rest."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As Davos said this, he was thinking in his heart: Wouldn't it be great if the kingdom's only powerful enemy and potential hidden dangers could be solved at the same time?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes..." After Aristiras responded, he still had no intention of leaving. Davos couldn't help but asked: "Do you have anything else?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aristras hesitated for a moment and said softly. : "Your Majesty... I have a request!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Say." Davos was curious: this intelligence chief, who was always cautious in his words and deeds, rarely made requests to him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, I have never left Thurii since I served you! This time I hope to follow you on the expedition to Persia!" Aristelas said sincerely.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked at him and was silent for a moment. He didn't know whether the main purpose of Aristelas's request was to resign in disguise as the director of the Intelligence Department, especially since he had just vetoed his resignation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, this is a little bit of my selfishness. If I can follow you and share a little bit of the glory of conquering Persia, a powerful country in the east, I will be able to tell you proudly when asked by my descendants in the future. Moreover, I can be transferred to Persia more conveniently and quickly. The personnel of the Intelligence Department are spying on the intelligence of Persia and disrupting its domestic order..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aristiras said again with a sincere expression: "You don't have to worry about domestic security. In fact, I have basically let go of the Ministry of Intelligence for more than half a year. The specific affairs of the Intelligence Department are all handled by Deputy Director Stratus, and with the full assistance of Clerk Maximus, the work efficiency of the Intelligence Department will only be stronger than before!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked at him, He suddenly laughed: "You Aristelas, it's rare to see you speak so much from your heart! In order to go out and relax, you don't hesitate to demean yourself! You have reached this point, how can I disagree? However, During the time when the Games is held, you have to arrange the affairs of the Intelligence Department. Oh, and... after the plan for the expedition to Persia is made public to the public, you have to admit to Azuna that you are going there yourself. It's not my request, hahaha..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Looking at Aristiras's leaving figure, Davos thought thoughtfully: It seems that Aristiras has seen that he wants to replace his old minister and serve as a conqueror. The thoughts of Lotokatax paving the way.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   If he agrees to go to Persia, then the positions of important departments in the kingdom have basically been taken over by young and powerful ministers... Oh, there is also Sedorum who has always been reluctant to go. It seems that I have to find a suitable person to go there at the right time. Wake him up&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Perhaps&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   it is because most of the residents of Crete are immigrants from Laconia, resulting in the The political system of each city-state is somewhat similar to that of Sparta. For example, they all have councils of elders, citizens' assemblies, and censorship systems. Boys in the city-state of Crete must receive education (mainly military training) from an early age...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, due to Crete's small terrain and lack of supplies, it was unable to unify Laconia like Sparta. Although the city-states established an alliance, they still maintained their independence, so they did not have enough financial and material resources to develop major cities. Infantry, but focus on training archers based on the actual conditions of the island.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the Greek war broke out 5 years ago and Sparta was conquered by Theonia, the city-states of Crete were shocked when they received the news. And a few months later, when Theonia's huge fleet circled Crete, When sailing offshore from the island of Crete, the councils of elders of the Cretan city-states quickly made a decision: to join the New Hellenic Alliance and surrender to Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the establishment of the New Greek Union, peace and tranquility have finally been restored in mainland Greece in the past few years. Citizens of Crete have no longer been recruited by city-states to be involved in wars in mainland Greece. Many Cretan citizens still have feelings for Theonia. grateful.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The year before last, King Theonia announced that he was "going to hold a grand games" and sent invitations to the city-states and countries in the Mediterranean. When the city-states of Crete also received invitation letters, the Cretans were surprised to find that Among the events listed in the letter was archery.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the past, Cretans also participated in sports games held in mainland Greece, but more often the children of nobles participated because their wealthy families could provide enough money for them to receive professional training in public fitness venues. The competitive level of the civilians was obvious. It was far different from them, but this time it was different. Archery was a skill that Cretan civilians were good at.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since Deolia only gave Cretan city-states a total of 5 archery participation places, the Cretan Alliance also held a grand archery competition, and finally selected the 5 best players to participate in the competition. Athletes participating in other events formed a Crete team and took a boat to Thurii in early June. Because this time the games will implement some new rules, they need to adapt first.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Megakides, a 20-year-old young man from the city of Heraklion in Crete, won the championship in the archery competition across the island of Crete. The people of Crete welcomed him. He has great expectations and he himself is full of confidence.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But when he arrived in Thurii and began to adapt to the venue, he discovered that the target used in the archery competition of the Theonian Games was not a human head target, but a novel circular target with five concentric circles painted on it. The closer the shot is to the center of the target, the higher the score, which requires players who want to win the championship to further improve their archery accuracy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When he first started practicing, Megakides' score was not high, and he was a little panicked. But with the continuous practice in the past twenty days, he has begun to adapt.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, he took out an arrow from the quiver, put it on the bow string, hooked the string with two fingers of his right hand, and slowly pulled it back. At the same time, he straightened his left hand to hold the bow and slowly raised it, his eyes always looking at the place 50 meters away in front of him. Target, until the bow string was half full, his arms were motionless, and his breathing was steady, he unconsciously loosened his fingers, and the arrow flew out.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Nine rings!" the target reporter shouted from the front.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Megakides shook his head slightly in dissatisfaction, and rubbed his sore right arm with his left hand.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This time, the three arrows shot a total of 26 rings. After four rounds of shooting, I can still achieve such training results. It is already very good!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After hearing the target reporter's praise, Megakides was not happy. He unconsciously turned his head to look at the contestants who were training seriously at other target positions.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Originally, he came to this sports meeting with the mentality that he was bound to win. As a result, during the past few days of practice, he learned that many players participating in the archery event had very good shooting skills, and most of them came from Dai. Various regions of Onia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As far as he knows, these Theonia players have also participated in military training since childhood. Youngsters who perform well in archery will have specialized teachers to help them strengthen their training in this area. When they reach adulthood, military camps in various regions of Theonia will They undergo archery tests, and those with the best performance will be given priority to be selected into the light infantry brigade, while those who are less qualified will become members of the reserve team. Then they will still undergo military training year after year, day after day, and sometimes go with the legion. The battlefield, participating in the battle...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He once asked a player from the East and West Sili regions of Deolia. The player told him: The East and West Sili regions held archery trials two months ago. Since there is no age limit for archery competitions, , so the number of people who signed up for the competition exceeded 5,000, and the entire selection lasted for 10 days. In the end, three contestants were selected through extra rounds (there are only three archery quotas in each region of Theonia)...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   one for Theonia The number of people participating in the archery trials in the region exceeds that of Crete, and there are dozens of regions in Theonia. The contestants selected from such a large number of people are naturally outstanding, and their performance on the training ground is also It really puts McGarkides under pressure.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "One more round!" he said solemnly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The target shooter did not hand him the arrow, but looked up at the sky, and then gently advised: "You have already shot for five rounds. If you continue to practice, you will easily strain your arm, and you will not be able to compete by then." . Besides, the sports meeting will be held tomorrow. Go back early and have a good rest. Only then will you have the energy to attend the ceremony held by the kingdom for the sports meeting tomorrow..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
