   Chapter 1070 The new administrative divisions of the kingdom (1)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "If the Sidisini people are still stubborn and refuse to listen to advice, then call together all the forces that signed the road construction agreement, vote collectively, and impose military punishment on the Sidisini people who violated the agreement and repeatedly refused to listen to advice!" Davos He said with a majestic look and powerful words: "Theonia can sit on the throne of the leader of central Italy because of our strong strength. If the Sidisini people have to jump out to provoke us, then just use their blood to do it." Build up our prestige!&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes!&#226;&#128;&#157; Alexis responded slightly excitedly&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "In addition... after the resolution of 'forming a border force' is passed by the Senate, Ansitanos, you go to the Etruscan envoy to discuss whether it is possible to build a road from Rome to the northern border of Etruria. This will help deliver military rations and supplies to the troops stationed there in the future."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, this is a good idea! Building the highway will also help connect the kingdom with Etruria, making mutual trade and personnel exchanges closer!" Marighi said slightly excitedly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "However, after the Gaulish army invades the Etruscan territory in a large scale, they can also use the highway to reach Rome more quickly.&#226;&#128;&#157; Lysias expressed concern.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This is a good thing." Davos said disapprovingly: "We are not afraid of fighting the Gauls head-on. Instead, we are hiding in the mountains to harass them like we are now, which is a bit of a headache."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, I will send someone to negotiate with the Etruscan envoys on this matter. I believe that under the current situation, they should agree to this proposal." Ansitanos responded, he paused briefly, and then said : "Yesterday, envoys from several tribes in West Numbia came to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, hoping to meet with His Majesty."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "For what?&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It was still a matter of the Masili tribe. They provoked conflicts and sent troops to invade the territories of these tribes.&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The Masili tribe..." Davos tapped his fingers on the armrest, pondered for a moment, and said: "...Although at the end of the last war, we had an agreement with the East and West Numibians not to interfere with them. internal affairs, and also had a secret agreement with the Masili tribe...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, we can no longer turn a blind eye to the Masili tribe's continuous intrusions into other tribes, because not only will this affect the trust of other Numibian tribes in us, but a unified West Numbia is not in our interests. The ambitions of the Masili tribe must be stopped!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Uh... I remember that another large tribe in West Numbia called... Padu has a grudge against the Masili tribe and is more submissive to us. You send someone to contact this tribe secretly and tell them, 'Dio Niya supports them in uniting other tribes against Masili and is willing to provide material support. '&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay, Your Majesty, I will do it immediately." Ansitanos understood immediately, but after thinking about it, he reminded: "There are several tribes' territories separated between the Padu tribe and Masili. The current leader's character Moderate, even if there is no actual threat, you may not agree.&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos stroked his chin with his hand, thought for a while, and then said: "If Padu rejects our suggestion, then let the Ministry of Foreign Affairs take action and persuade most of the leaders of West Numbia to apply to the kingdom. We strongly urge the Kingdom to intervene in this conflict and restore peace to West Numbia... In this way, we will not violate the agreement."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Understood." Ansitanos actually had this idea in his mind for a long time, but he just asked Davos to take the initiative to say it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, does our Ministry of Military Affairs want to prepare for the conflict in West Numbia?&#226;&#128;&#157; Alexis asked.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos nodded: "Regardless of whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' mission is successful or not, your Ministry of Military Affairs must first ask the staff office to conduct war deductions based on the premise of diplomatic failure and military intervention, and then make preparations based on the results of the deductions, so as to truly It can be used immediately when needed.&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "yes."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked at Lysias again and said: "Although Carthage has been quiet in the past few years, we cannot relax our vigilance. The intelligence department will tighten its surveillance. Administrator Hadrumantum Is it Litagus?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, Your Majesty.&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Tell him about it so that he too can be prepared.&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After getting another response from Lysias, Davos looked at everyone and asked again: "Are there any other questions?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, the construction process of the main temple of Hades is accelerating. In two days, after the design of the giant statue on the top of the mountain is confirmed, the carving and modeling will begin. I believe that before next year's celebration, the main god of Hades will The temple will definitely be completed." Heraclides said as if he was taking credit for building the great city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Very good!" Davos praised lightly. He did not want to talk more about the temple reconstruction at the administrative meeting, because at the beginning, under Plessinas' proposal, he received the support of many senators and ministers. support, but some are still opposed, not only because the war has just ended and the country has not yet fully recovered. It is a waste of time and money to build such a large public building, but also because there will be special ceremonies when the main temple is built, allowing a small number of people to People are worried&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It seems that you have no other questions." Davos changed the subject and said slowly: "As for the last question you raised, 'In view of the vast territory of the kingdom, in order to facilitate the management of the kingdom, we hope to divide the provinces into provinces and establish permanent governors. I have already made a decision about the proposal of a new position."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as these words came out, everyone suddenly became energetic and listened attentively.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos saw this in his eyes and continued calmly: "I think your proposal is correct. Just like what I just said, 'the situation in the kingdom has changed, the situation has changed, and the old system will also follow. Change to adapt to new developments.' However, the two terms 'province and governor' are derived from Persia and do not match our Theonia. I am more accustomed to using the term 'region and regional administrator' Two words were used instead to show the difference between the Kingdom of Theonia and Persia.&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Region and chief executive...&#226;&#128;&#157; Everyone whispered these two terms.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, these two terms are better, easy to understand, and correspond to our two words 'city and city chief'. Even ordinary people can understand the meaning." Even Ansita, who is a scholar, Nostal said this, and others had no objections.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos smiled and said: "Herni, go and bring up the map of the kingdom."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The word "lift" is used because this map was drawn on a huge wooden board. It not only showed the existing territory of the kingdom, but included all areas of the entire Western Mediterranean. Of course, other areas were depicted. are not as detailed and accurate as those within the Kingdom, so that the area north of the Iberian Peninsula and the Italian Peninsula is basically a blur.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos stepped down from the throne, took the long wooden pole from Henepolis, used it to draw on the map and said: "The far north, the towns we have in Latium and the Etruria north of the Taibo River The sub-towns were merged into the Roman region, a Roman administrator was established, and the government was located in Rome;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The towns of Campania, Samone and Enona that we have were merged into the eastern region of Campania, with Beneventum as its seat of government;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Further south, the towns of the original Lucania and the three coastal towns of Poseidonia, Elea, and Picosis were merged into the Lucania region, with its seat at Grumentum;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The towns of the original Bruti and Laos were merged into the Bruti region, governed in Cosenza;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The original Apulian region was divided into the Dauni region, the Pucheti region, and the Mesapei region according to the original territories of the three ethnic groups: Dauni, Pucheti, and Mesapi. The Dauni region was governed in Luceni Asia, the seat of Pucheti is at Silvim, and the seat of Messape is at Oudi&#195;&#168;re;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Heraclea and Metapontum were incorporated into the Turii region, and the seat of government remains here..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, does Bithynia belong to the Bruti region or the Thurii region?&#226;&#128;&#157; Sedorum asked softly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Oh, I just made a slip of the tongue. Bisignia still belongs to the Thurii region." Davos immediately corrected it, and then said: "Crimissa, Asproustum, Crotone , Siliting merged into the Crotone region, and its governance is in Crotone;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Trina, Hibernian, Colonia, Medma, and Locle were merged into the southern region of Magna Graecia, with its seat in Trina;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Taurina, Regim, Messina, Mile, Tyndares and the unfinished Himera (after the old city of Himera was destroyed by the Carthaginians, no one dared to rebuild there for decades town, but after the Western Mediterranean War, the entire Sicily has been placed under the rule of the Kingdom of Theonia. Sipulos, who was still the wartime governor of Sicily at the time, made a suggestion to rebuild the city of Himera. Two reasons: First, the area The area is the only relatively broad, flat lowland on the northern coast of Sicily, and the soil is fertile, which is conducive to the settlement of a larger population; secondly, because it was less affected by the war, some Greek city-states on the northern coast were not incorporated into Daisy after the war. The Kingdom of Onia, but attached to Theonia, became an autonomous city-state like Tarantum. Due to the early surrender of Saurus and Palermos, Theonia kept its promise and allowed them to be autonomous. La is located exactly in the center of the north coast, and its establishment is conducive to the stability of the north coast of Sicily) merged into the Straits area, where it is governed - "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos paused and said, "Lijim and Messina."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as these words came out, the ministers were surprised. Mariji thought for a moment and immediately praised loudly: "Your Majesty is wise! Turning Lijim and Messina into one region will be conducive to the unified management of the Messina Strait area." Shipping problem! Setting the seat of government in Messina and Lijim at the same time will be more conducive to resolving the centuries-old conflicts between the people of the two towns!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, many of the ancestors of the people in these two cities came from the same ally. The two cities are only 10 nautical miles apart. However, due to interest issues, there have been constant conflicts. Even after joining the kingdom, this is still the case. I once went to mediate. several times.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This time His Majesty has designated these two cities as regional governance centers at the same time, which will help officials and the people work together to resolve conflicts and improve the efficiency of governance for the common benefit. This is a great initiative! "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos smiled and said nothing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "But since the government offices are in Messina and Lijim at the same time, it may be difficult to manage.&#226;&#128;&#157; Mentotic Els asked with some confusion.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thanks to the other side of remembrance for the reward! Your support is my biggest motivation for writing! !&#13;
