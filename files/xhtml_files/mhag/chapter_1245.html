   Chapter 1245 Preparations for the Games (2)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "In addition, we initially estimate that during the Games, more than 100,000 tourists may come to Turii to watch the games compared to usual times, which will inevitably bring consequences to the entire Turii It's a big burden. I discussed it with Master Agarcia (Agarcia was promoted to the Minister of Inspection the year before last). He has already transferred a lot of patrol teams from nearby areas and is preparing to send more patrol teams during the sports games to maintain the entire map. order in the Tuli area.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Considering that maybe half of these tourists are coming to Tulii for the first time, our preparatory team referred to the method implemented when the rugby finals first started, mobilizing various schools in Tulii and Dai Young people over the age of 16 from Onia Academy serve as volunteers for the sports games to provide help to these tourists..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Clotokatax spent more than 10 minutes and explained the preparations in a clear and logical manner, the minister They began to discuss quietly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The first person to ask the question was Finance Minister Archibides: "Lord Consul, over the past two years, your preparatory team has withdrawn 1,000 talents of silver from the treasury. It is said that there is not much left. After the sports meeting, You will also award a large amount of silver to the athletes who win the championship in each event, and hold a grand celebration banquet at the end of the sports meeting... I just want to ask the preparatory team how much more funding it needs from the Finance Department?" Because of consideration When the subject of his question was the future king, Archibides' tone had already been as restrained as possible.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax said with a smile: "Lord Archibides, the information you got is not accurate. The bonuses for the winning athletes and the cost of the final celebration banquet are all included in the money allocated to the preparation team by the Finance Department. This amount of money has been allocated, so it gives you this illusion. In fact, this amount of money is not only completely sufficient, but there should be some leftover at the end of the sports meeting." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then after the sports meeting is over, Please return the remaining money to the Finance Department as soon as possible!" Archibedes blurted out.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "As one of the members of the preparatory group, I would like to add one more explanation." Business Secretary Flaccus interjected (the year before last, Marigi resigned and retired due to old age and frailty, and Flaccus recommended by him was able to take over): "His Royal Highness Clotokatax just said it very modestly. In fact, by the end of the sports meeting, the preparatory team will not only have a little money left, but a lot of money.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The first is the temporary addition we built in the city. Most of the shops in several commercial streets had been sold yesterday, and the rent received had exceeded 100 talents. In addition, many foreign businessmen registered at the business office in Turiyi and requested to rent shops during the sports games. Now the few additional commercial streets are no longer enough. Last night, His Highness urgently convened a small meeting of the preparatory team, and finally decided to add three more temporary markets near the ports of Castellon and Amendolara... ... I believe that by the end of the games, we will be able to earn about 300 talents from store rent alone."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Flakus became more and more proud as he talked: "Also... all the product advertising positions inside and outside each stadium have been occupied. Sold, its revenue also exceeded 100 talents (the placement and hanging of wooden boards for advertising goods inside and outside the arena began in Thurii 10 years ago, precisely to see the annual rugby and football finals being held In full swing, Davos inadvertently proposed this suggestion to Mariji. Mariji immediately started to implement it as soon as he found the treasure. At first, the businessmen were not willing to spend money to place advertisements in the arena, mainly to please the Secretary of Commerce Mariji. Ji, as a result, the sales volume of all goods that are advertised in the arena has a big increase. Since then, the practice of using competitive games to advertise has become popular in the kingdom).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition, according to the predictions of our Ministry of Commerce, July will be due to With the Games held, the commercial taxes in the entire Thurii region will more than double, which means that the income will increase by at least 600 talents!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Lord Archibedes, has this already reduced the previous financial situation? The 1,000 talents paid by the Ministry have been earned back! Not to mention that the holding of the Games will enhance the appeal of Turii to the people throughout the Mediterranean. After the Games, the number of people traveling to Turii should continue to grow in the long term. This will be of great benefit to our tax revenue."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay!" Davos patted the armrest of the throne and said with a smile: "You have made so much money before the game has even started. It seems that we insist on Holding this sports meeting does not waste people and money just because of gambling, but it is of great benefit to the national treasury!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hearing Davos's words, the ministers who initially expressed opposition were slightly embarrassed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, Mentotic Els, the Minister of Academic Affairs, asked: "Your Highness, Thurii is densely populated. I remember that Lysias, the current director of Theonia Academy, once wrote an article many years ago, describing The hustle and bustle of Turii, as well as the busy sea and land transportation and countless people working hard to ensure the food, clothing and housing of the people of Turii... Now the sports meeting will be held in Turii. You just said that there will be more than 100 people in Turii in a short period of time. 100,000 people flocked to Turii! 100,000 people is a huge number. Will it overwhelm the entire urban supply system of Turii and bring huge difficulties to the lives of the people of Turii?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This question Let me answer it." Tellis, the administrator of Turiyi Region, took over and said: "Let's talk about food first. The businessmen of the kingdom are very shrewd, and they have already predicted that this sports meeting will be very grand. , so many restaurants and hotels have begun to stock up on grains, cured meats, cattle and sheep, and wine in the past few months... According to the news I have received, half of the warehouses in all ports and markets have now been used to store food, supplying five , there should be no problem if 600,000 people can eat it for a month. If there is still a shortage, I have reached an agreement with Mr. Burkos. In an emergency, the granary in northern Turiyi can be used to stabilize the possible rise in Turiyi. Food prices.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Let's talk about housing. In fact, there is no need to worry too much. Nowadays, most citizens in urban and suburban areas rely on renting houses for a living. There are enough houses for tyrannical tourists. And the market will automatically guide tourists not to be crowded. Living in urban areas, because housing prices in urban areas are inevitably expensive, and the further away from the urban area, the cheaper the rental price, such as Amendolara, Castellon, Bisignia and even Crimesa. I want tourists who come to watch the sports games. They are not necessarily rich people. They have to stay in the Turiyi area for more than 10 days or even a month. They will definitely decide the area to live based on the amount of gold and silver they bring. Moreover, the trained volunteers will also specially Guide tourists. When tourists are scattered throughout the Turii area, I think the people of Turii will not feel too crowded and noisy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, we must ensure that tourists scattered throughout the Turii area can go smoothly To watch the games in a timely manner, we must also have convenient and fast transportation. This is actually not a big problem. The road conditions in the Thurii area are the best in the entire kingdom, and for this sports meeting, starting from last year Lord Heraclid personally urged his subordinates to build new roads and bridges.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition, our Thurii District Administration Office will also issue some temporary decrees during the sports games, such as that pack teams are not allowed to enter the city during the day, and cargo transportation must rely on shipping as much as possible... &#226;&#128;&#166;For another example, apart from going to watch games, the people of Thurii try to reduce travel as much as possible&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition, the Executive Office also specially negotiated with the Horse Carriage Association, requiring them to still transport passengers at the usual prices during the sports games, and to provide considerate services.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   His Highness has just mentioned that Mr. Agarcia will strengthen security in the Turiyi area during the sports games. Another important issue that needs attention is to prevent fires.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It's summer now, the weather is dry, and the crowds are crowded during the sports games. If a fire breaks out, the consequences will be disastrous.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, the Executive Office formulated a plan in this regard a few months ago and began to implement it. During the sports games, the fire brigade in the entire region must be on standby all day long, ready to set off for rescue at any time; some volunteers were deployed to serve as temporary firefighters, and after specialized training and responsible for fire patrols in each block; the fire brigade also requires that people's homes in the Turiyi area must be equipped with pools filled with water. Now that each block has gone through several rounds of inspections, it has basically met the requirements; the Administration Department has also successively Fire prevention training was organized in various neighborhoods..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Very good!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Telis, your Turiyi Administration Office has been very considerate and well prepared, which makes me more confident in the success of the Games.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Davos smiled and praised.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, this is the result of more than a year of hard work by His Highness and the preparation team!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Tellis responded modestly. As the regional administrator, he could not attend the meeting of ministers originally, but since the main topic of this meeting was the preparations for the Games, of course he had to attend. In fact, in the year before last, Lysias and Hermon successively After retirement, he also participated in the Senate's election as a backup candidate for the auxiliary ministers, but ultimately lost to Bagulu and Asistes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I heard that Olympia, Delphi, the Poseidon priests in Corinth, and the Athens The Parthenon priests all refused to come to Thurii to participate in the referee training. How did the preparatory team deal with this?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Foreign Minister Tapirus asked.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I would like to leave this question to the respected priest Plessinas to answer.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Klotokatax smiled and made an invitation gesture to his side.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   According to regulations, the scepter priest Plesinas is usually not allowed to attend the administrative meeting of the kingdom's ministers, but as a member of the preparatory team, he I also received an invitation today. Even though he is over 70 years old, he is still rosy and energetic. He smiled slightly and looked even more benevolent: "Before answering Lord Tapirus's question, first of all, I would like to sincerely thank His Majesty for your courage and courage. Holding such a grand sports meeting gives the Temple of Hades such a good opportunity to show the light and glory of the god Hades to the world!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
