   Before the election of the regional chief executive in Chapter 1101 (5)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   , Agnes defended Alcibiadas, saying, "He was just surprised by his nephew's intelligence and couldn't help but want to show off to others, so he was too showy, but There is no other meaning besides that..." Davos didn't quite believe these words because it couldn't explain the reason why he wanted to entertain Plato: Could it be that he knew that Plato had a good relationship with him and that he highly praised philosophy? Wang governs the country, so you want to influence yourself through him?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since he had seen too much history about the struggle for royal power in his previous life, Davos did not hesitate to speculate on this matter with the worst malice: Perhaps in the past, Alcibiadas had indeed invested all his interest and energy in business, and was not interested in politics and politics. Power is not interested, but now that he has become a big businessman and is as rich as the country, it is inevitable that he will have other ideas. After all, he is the son of the shrewd Adili Cruz, and there will always be some inheritance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, Davos decided not to pay attention to this relative in the short term, and would continue to reduce orders to his shipyard until he remembered this lesson!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although he has opinions about Alcibiades, it will not affect Davos' appreciation of the candidates he recommended.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos's first impression of Feidun was that he was not afraid of powerful enemies, brave to fight, and indomitable when facing Dionysius's army.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And Feidun had just joined Theonia and participated in the Kingdom Conference. It was the meeting of the Senate to select the town chief executive. This Lijim hero who was very interested in Theonia's unique political system did something shocking. Not only did he take the initiative to apply to participate in the election, but he also insisted on doing so after the rotating presidents kindly discouraged him. His reason was that he was good at mastering Theonia's laws and regulations more quickly in practice. political system.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This somewhat angered the rotating chairman and the elders. With the mentality of wanting him to learn a lesson and at the same time ensuring the stability of the kingdom's political situation, they simply elected him as the chief executive of Amendolara, and at the same time appointed two experienced administrators. adjutant.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Feidun did encounter a lot of trouble during the initial period when he took office. He was not familiar with government affairs, officials were not actively cooperating, people came to protest every day, and the administrative affairs of the entire town were almost stagnant... The Senate was ready to remove him from his position at any time.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But Feidun was not intimidated by difficulties. He was so energetic that he took the time to study the laws and systems of Theonia at night. During the day, he humbly asked his subordinates for advice regardless of his identity. He was not only able to humbly accept people's protests, but also He personally went to the problem site to investigate and study. Gradually, his positive attitude infected his officials and impressed the citizens of Amendolara. Officials began to cooperate, people complained less, and government affairs gradually got on the right track...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Four months later Amendolara's government affairs returned to normal. A year later, Feidun was able to handle town affairs as calmly as a veteran who had served as chief executive for many years. However, his hands-on, open-minded and inquisitive style remained unchanged. Although Amen Dorara is a very stable kingdom town, but it is not easy to manage it well. However, after three years, most of the people here declared with one voice: Feidun is the best administrator they have ever encountered.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is already amazing!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thinking about Feidun's administrative qualifications in the kingdom, it is even more amazing. The rotating presidents even came up with the idea: Amendolara should be governed by inexperienced senators. Perhaps only they can keep it. Humility in government affairs and the ability to have the patience to meet the needs of the discerning citizens of Amendolara.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, the Senate would later choose Publius to take over the post of chief executive of Amendolara.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Feidun's outstanding performance also aroused great curiosity in Davos. In order to see how capable this veteran was, he secretly instructed him to serve as the administrator of Naxos, and that There will be far fewer people who oppose the election at one time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Judging from the current situation, Feidun's governance is still excellent, especially the series of measures taken against the Sikel tribe west of Mount Etna. Strictly speaking, this is not under the jurisdiction of the Naxos Administrator. However, he dared to take responsibility and was not afraid of making trouble. He took over the matter decisively, and the final results were very good.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This proactive style is what Davos appreciates most, and it is also an excellent quality that a regional chief executive should possess.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, Davos looked at Feidun in the venue. His sculpture-like face was covered with dark skin that looked as if it had been blown by wind and rain. It looked extremely cold and hard, but also as if it was a man. He is as calm as an old official, but in fact he is less than 50 years old. His administrative experience in the kingdom is only six years, but he has been the chief executive of a town for nearly six years. This resume is indeed enough to stand out from everyone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What Davos doesn't understand is that Feidun has a tough character and Alcibiades is flexible. Their personalities are not compatible, but they still have a good relationship.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maybe it's because both of them are from Lijim, or maybe it's because the two worked together to quell the Lijim chaos that year, and thus formed a friendship, or maybe it's because of their complementary personalities...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But no matter what, with Arcee The support of Bidas (after all, Alcibiadas is a relative of the royal family and has some supporters in the Senate. Other senators are unwilling to conflict with him unless huge interests are involved), plus Feidun With my abilities, I believe I can get a lot of support.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What's more, Feidun fought side by side with General Theonia in the South Italian War and gained a lot of friendship. I believe he has a good chance of winning.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As long as he does not do something taboo with Alcibiades in the future, Davos is willing to give these outstanding administrative talents a larger stage to give full play to their abilities.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Alcibiadas sat down, another senator stood up: "I recommend Myron..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It turned out to be Freeniris from Coronia... Myron was not surprised by this recommender. , after all, Karennia was once a member of the Crotone League.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lysias was already familiar with the senior officials of Corunnia. After joining Theonia, he strengthened his ties with these elders from the original Crotone Alliance. Unfortunately, it was difficult to unite them. rose up and became another major faction in the Senate.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reason is very simple, because three of the five rotating presidents are from the original Crotone League: Although Sipulos has good relations with many people, he never interacts deeply with people in private, nor does he form cliques. Pie; Antaolis and Lysias had different personalities and could not get along with each other.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This made the Clotone faction, which Lysias had hoped would become the most powerful faction in the Senate of the Kingdom, still a mirage.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Catania region has vast land, a large population, and prosperous agriculture, commerce, forestry, and animal husbandry. Therefore, there are many people participating in the competition, and the conflicts and arguments between them are more intense: Milon serves in the Catania region The issue of being too long was pointed out; Feidun was also questioned as he had served as town administrator for too short a time and had too little experience, and whether he could manage such an important area well; some candidates were directly exposed to their past resumes Mistakes in...etc.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Arguments broke out in the venue.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is often the time when the etiquette officer comes into play. He will stop the over-emotional elders from speaking insulting language, and will also warn those who violate the order of speaking and stand up to speak at will... In short, they are working hard to maintain the order of the venue. order to prevent this sacred place from turning into a noisy and abusive marketplace.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   These fierce debates in the venue cannot change the elders who have already supported the goal in advance, but they can influence those elders who still remain neutral.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is also what Davos hopes to see: in this fiercely competitive situation, veterans with mediocre talents and little achievements in the past simply do not dare to come out to run for office, so as to avoid being picked on by everyone with their eyes wide open, which will lead to embarrassment and inability to vote. Taiwan, so as to ensure that the elected regional chief executive is at least above the standard.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The final result of the election - Feidun won.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While Milon applauded and congratulated Feidun again, he felt a little more uneasy. Although the election progress was indeed as Lysias expected, he also felt nervous when he saw the competition was so fierce.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The next thing to be elected is the Syracuse region!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The name "Syracuse" alone was enough to attract many senators to participate in the election, but when the ceremonial officer called out Felicius's name, everyone's hearts It's all a matter of urgency: The army is finally taking action!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I recommend Lord Adriancus!" Felicius only said this and stopped talking, because he thought that Adriancus's political achievements were already well known and there was no need for him to say more, but But it gave many elders the impression that the people sent by the army were really domineering!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   His recommendation scared off some candidates and aroused the dissatisfaction of others. Therefore, there were several people participating in the recommendation. The debate was still fierce, but the final result of the vote was still - Adrian Costco won the election.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Facts have proved that although the military faction, one of the founders of Theonia and another important faction in the Senate, does not take the initiative to speak much in meetings, once they become serious, they can influence the direction of the meeting.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The next one to be recommended is the south coast of Sicily!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Antaoris's words made Davos pay a little more attention, because his original target was Amikles, but now Amikles has become Mexico. Chief executive of the Sina Strait region, he wanted to see what kind of candidates the elders would propose.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Unexpectedly, the first name called by the ceremonial officer surprised him: "Lord Amyntas!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Amyntas stood up suddenly, and glanced at the senators who were whispering with two sharp eyes, speaking loudly It was enough to overwhelm the noise in the venue: "I recommend Agarcia. He once followed His Majesty on the Persian expedition and was a senator at the beginning of the establishment of Theonia. He is fully qualified to become the regional administrator!"
