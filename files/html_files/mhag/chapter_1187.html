   Chapter 1187 Plato's Choice
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Plato frowned, put down the pen in his hand, and said: "Oleas, don't panic! I said, try to stay calm in everything you do, because only calmness can lead to rational thinking. Especially you, you have said it many times, but you always forget it!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Teacher...that's it, today's 5,000-person meeting passed the resolution of 'joining the Greek Alliance and declaring war on Theonia'..." Oleas gasped.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Plato was not surprised, and just shook his head gently: "Didn't I say it before? Judging from the current situation in Athens, it will be a matter of time before Athens declares war on Theonia. These stupid Athenians , are always easily driven by anger and lose their minds. The citizens' assembly, which holds the highest power in the city-state, has become a place for them to vent their emotions. This is the flaw of the so-called democratic government!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Teacher... and..." Olea Si swallowed his saliva and wanted to continue, but was replaced by a calmer voice: "Teacher, the citizens' assembly also passed a resolution - saying that you are treason and you will be tried!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Si Dipus walked in In the room, he said with a sad and angry expression: "I once went to the stage to defend you, but I couldn't stop it from passing..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Plato looked at his proud disciple and saw several bruises on his face and a swollen chin. Imagining the terrible situation at that time, he whispered heartbrokenly: "Thank you for your hard work, I let you worry about me!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You are our respected teacher, this is what we should do!" Oleas finally regained his breath and was filled with righteous indignation. Said: "It's a good thing you didn't attend the citizens' meeting today. The situation at the meeting was too bad! Especially Isocrates. He even wrote a speech and asked his students to read it at the meeting. It was full of words that slandered you. , but those ignorant people listened to his words, Spyprous came on the stage to defend you, but those people who lost their minds yelled at us as traitors, and attacked us with pottery pieces..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I can imagine what the situation is like. Oops." Plato's expression became serious: "I also participated in the citizens' assembly that called for the trial of Teacher Socrates!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Teacher, Socrates did not listen to your advice back then. I believe that the citizens' assembly will give him justice. A fair trial, but in the end he lost his life! You must not-" Spesippus eagerly wanted to persuade.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I know what you want to say, don't worry, I'm not Teacher Socrates!" Plato lowered his head, looked at the manuscript on the desk, and gradually made up his mind, he said firmly: "That so-called I will not participate in a fair court trial! I haven't finished my exploration of the city-state's political system, I still have books to write, and I don't want to die miserably so soon, so I decided to leave Athens first!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " Peisippus was obviously relieved, but Oleas said hesitantly: "Teacher, if you leave like this, it will... make those ignorant people believe the slander of Isocrates and others even more!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "A momentary slander is nothing, time will eventually prove who is right and who is wrong!" Plato said confidently.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Teacher, where are you going after leaving Athens?" Spisippus asked again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Since Isocrates said that I colluded with Theonia, then I will go to Thurii and study in their Thurii Academy for a while..." Plato said with hope: "When we return to Athens When the time comes, we can make Akademi Academy run better!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Teacher, I'll go with you!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Me too!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………………… …………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, the chief general of Athens, Callistratus, was meeting with the Persian envoy Datis at his home.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Datis had been staying in Spartan territory before, but after the Theonian army captured Messenia and the First Fleet began to block the coast of Sparta, Datis felt scared and worried about the future of Datis. When the Oonian army attacked Sparta's territory, he could not escape, so he used the excuse to supervise and coordinate the mercenaries and supplies delivered by Persia to Sparta. As a result, he ran to Corinth and was attacked by the Theonian First Fleet. Feeling uneasy about the port of Corinth, he soon arrived in Athens.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Congratulations, general, your proposal was finally passed at the citizens' assembly!" Datis congratulated Callistratus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus said seriously: "You are mistaken. This proposal was jointly discussed and formulated by our generals' executive committee, and it is the common wish of most Athenian citizens!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this point, he smiled: " I believe that your king will be very happy when he learns the news." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It's hard to say." Datis said nonchalantly: "The King of Persia hopes that Greece can maintain peace. If he learns A big war will break out here again, and I'm afraid he will be very angry if the 'Peace of Callias' that he worked so hard to urge you to sign cannot be implemented!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus sat up straight, his eyes sharp. Looking at Datis, he said seriously: "Let us all open up and tell the truth. The reason why the King of Persia asked the Greek city-states to sign the contract is because he hopes that we will unite to defend Theonia! And now his The wish is coming true. The Greek city-states are forming an alliance to resist the invading Theonian army. I believe that if you report this news to the King of Persia, he will be very happy and will reward you greatly!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dati Si didn't respond, but a smile appeared on his face involuntarily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus continued: "But if this newly formed alliance is defeated by the Theonians, allowing the Theonians to control Greece, then I think this will never be a good thing for Persia. I'm afraid that the King of Persia will treat you..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Datis suddenly darkened his face: "What do you mean by this?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Don't misunderstand!" Callistratus said sincerely: "I just I want to tell you that the interests of Persia, the interests of Athens, and the interests of you and me are the same on the important issue of defeating the Theonians. Athens needs your help!" Datis was
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   stunned for a moment, and then became quite confused. He smiled meaningfully: "What help can I, a small envoy, give to Athens?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "In the past few days in Athens, I believe you have learned that we have financial difficulties. The treasury is short of money and cannot provide sufficient supplies for the army. Military resources, without money, it is impossible to form a large army, and even if other city-states join this alliance, if they see that Athens has not taken action for a long time, I am afraid they will hesitate... And if this situation continues for a long time, The situation will only be beneficial to Theonia!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reason why the King of Persia hopes that our Greek city-states will unite to defend Theonia is because Theonia has the strength to pose a threat to Persia!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now that Theonia has discovered our attempt, we will definitely send more troops to Greece!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sparta suffered a defeat in the Battle of Leuctra before, and now it has lost Messenia. Its strength has been greatly weakened. Even with your assistance, I think they are by no means a match for the Theonian army!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now we are the only ones in Athens who can call on all the city-states in Greece to protect Greece!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So we hope to get full assistance from Persia, not only gold and silver, but also navy!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus said in a sincere voice: "We currently have insufficient warships to confront the Theonia fleet. Once we go to war with Theonia, the Theonia fleet will inevitably blockade Theonia. Dragon Bay, it will be very difficult for Athens to obtain war supplies from the outside, so we need Persian naval support!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As long as Persia fully supports Athens, I guarantee you that Athens will make Greece a strong barrier against Theonia!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Datis looked at Callistratus, who was a little excited, and couldn't help but take a breath: Athens wants to replace Sparta!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Countless thoughts flashed through his mind, and Datis fell into Meditating.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus did not rush and waited quietly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a long time, Datis said: "I will convey your request to the king as soon as possible.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Considering your current financial difficulties, I can first withdraw part of the funds allocated by the king to Sparta so that you can build an army as soon as possible, but I first need to see the sincerity of your Athens.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What sincerity?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "First send some citizen soldiers to the Peloponnese to help the Spartans.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   thought for a while and then said: "I have to discuss this matter with other generals first, and then submit it to the council for discussion before I can give you an answer, but I think the problem is not big."
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Okay, that's it. I hope you, Athens and Sparta, will work together to repel the Theonians and restore peace to Greece!"
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Datis said righteously, and suddenly remembered something: "Well... the king may agree to your other requests from Athens, but regarding the Persian navy's assistance... you must be mentally prepared, the king may not necessarily agree." agree.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Why?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Callistratus was a little confused. You must know that during the Corinthian War, in order to suppress the Spartans, the governor of Virginia, Pharnabazus, asked Conon to lead the Persian fleet to attack Sparta. Later, Conon unauthorized The King of Persia did not seem to pursue any further investigation after leaving those warships in Athens. This shows that the King of Persia was generous and well-informed, and was willing to invest heavily at critical moments.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Because we in Persia will have a major military operation, The navy is indispensable.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What military operation?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Callistratus' heart moved.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You will know soon.
  </font>
