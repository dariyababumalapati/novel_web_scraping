   Chapter 1239 Disputes of Interests
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Among the merchants in Thurii, Theos has the closest contacts with officials, especially with the Ministry of Military Affairs, and now he has become a relative of the king.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I don't have any inside information." Theos said seriously: "To be honest, you don't want to hear it. Your brother doesn't have any amazing achievements. It is generally difficult for a legion commander to be promoted based on his seniority. To become a senator, but because of you, he has a great chance..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Me?!" Saustatus was a little confused.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Theos reminded him softly: "You have provided a lot of help to the expansion of the kingdom in the past. Take the Greek War as an example. In order to transport troops to Greece and Thessaly, you organized a large number of ships many times. Intermittently helping to transport baggage, and even in the later period there were some difficulties in supplying military food. As the president of the Turiyi Chamber of Commerce, you also organized many merchants from the kingdom to purchase a large amount of food through loans from the kingdom, helping the Ministry of Military Affairs to tide over. Difficulty... You did something like this in the Gallic War, and the Ministry of Military Affairs will probably not forget it. If you can get the Ministry of Military Affairs to agree to push your brother to join the Senate, then there will be absolutely no problem for your brother to become a senator."

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Suo .
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Status's eyes lit up. He knew that military veterans were a very important force in the Senate. If he got the support of the Ministry of Military Affairs, this would definitely be possible.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He immediately pulled Tios to the living room in the backyard with a happy face, ready to talk with him in detail.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Due to business needs, Sostatus's house had two restaurants. One was in the front yard, used to entertain businessmen from his huge distribution network, while the living room in the backyard was used to receive important guests.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After sitting down, Theos talked to him about another matter with a serious look: "Sostatus, are the things you did to Dickpolis excessive?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sostatus He was not surprised. He was prepared for Theos to mention this matter, and immediately defended: "You have definitely wronged me. I have no hatred towards Lord Dickpolis. On the contrary, I respect him very much." He took the initiative to humbly give up the position of president of the Liyi Chamber of Commerce to me. I am not a person who repays kindness with enmity. You see, in the past few years, my fleet has transported the pottery produced in his workshop to mainland Greece and Ionia. To sell, the sales volume is increasing every year, helping him open up the market, and earning him a lot of money. If I had a grudge against him, would I do this?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Theos said thoughtfully: "... But you brought pottery from Athens and sold it in Thurii. Now many officials and wealthy people are more willing to buy your pottery, causing the sales of Decapolis pottery in Thurii to drop greatly... Sostatus, Our Chamber of Commerce once had regulations that 'prohibited malicious competition among Chamber of Commerce members'. As the current president of the Chamber of Commerce, you should take the lead..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing these words, Sostatus suppressed the anger rising in his heart. , he said a little rudely: "Lord Theos, I know you and Dickpolis are good friends, but you can't speak for him regardless of the facts. The price of the pottery I sell is more than twice as expensive as his pottery. Not only that, how can this be called vicious competition?! And it is precisely because of considering him that I don't import too many pottery and only sell it in Turii. This is the biggest concession I can make. He is still dissatisfied like this, what else does he want me to do?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Theos hesitated for a moment, sighed and said: "...We have been friends for decades, and you are a big businessman with strong financial resources. Distributing so many types of goods, why should the relationship between you two be so tense because of pottery..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Theos, I have always respected you as a person, but what you said today is wrong. !" Saustatus' anger was palpable: "You all expect me to sell your goods in large quantities to the Eastern Mediterranean, but you don't allow me to bring the goods from the Eastern Mediterranean to the kingdom for sale. What's the point of this?! If you really want to do this, then I will go see His Majesty Davos and tell him that Dickpolis and you strongly request that goods produced outside the kingdom not be sold in the Tulii area!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Eh... eh, I That's not what I meant." Theos quickly defended: "Look, since you introduced Athenian pottery to Thurii for sale, not only the upper echelons of the kingdom are willing to use it, but I heard that even His Majesty wants to buy it from you. This is bound to happen. A trend has formed. If this continues, Dickpolis's pottery sales in the kingdom will inevitably decline greatly. You also know that Dickpolis has pottery workshops in many towns in the kingdom. It will be difficult for him to maintain such a large scale by then. You may even face bankruptcy..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sostatus put on a solemn face and said: "After the Greek War, His Majesty asked the Ministry of Commerce to convene a meeting with the presidents of the chambers of commerce in various towns, at which he specifically proposed that For the local Greek businessmen who will come to the kingdom to do business, we must not exclude or suppress them, but try to help them. After I finished the meeting, I specially called you to convey the message. Both you and Dickpolis expressed their full support at the meeting. Do you still remember this?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Theos nodded helplessly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I am also carrying out your Majesty's order!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thorstatus said confidently: "In the past few years, I have not only sold Athenian pottery in the Thurii area, but also Corinthian ironware, Greek stones, Thessalian horses, Athenian gold and silver products... Why didn't you tell me Protest, Inipias didn't protest to me... So what if Decapolis was dissatisfied with me?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because the quality of his pottery was not as good as the Athenian pottery, he was afraid of competition!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Theos
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   persuaded in a gentle tone: "Over the years, Dicopolis has worked very hard to improve the quality of pottery, and even improved the process of making pottery... You and I both know this, but Athenian pottery has developed. With hundreds of years of history and a deep foundation, it is impossible for Dickpolis's workshop to catch up in a short period of time...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   His Majesty hopes to win over local Greek businessmen, and also hopes that the kingdom's market will be more diversified, increase competition, and allow the people to have more Choice, I don't want an exclusive monopoly... I understand all this, but if Athenian pottery sells in large quantities in the kingdom, it will only push the still hardworking Dickpolis to a dead end. I think this is not what your Majesty wants to see. Yes.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sostatus
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   was shocked and immediately said: "As the president of the Thurii Chamber of Commerce, of course I will not deliberately harm the interests of the members of the chamber of commerce. It has been more than two years since I started selling Athenian pottery in Thurii. The sales volume has been kept very low since then, and all the products introduced are high-quality products at very high prices. The sale of ordinary pottery is still occupied by Dickpolis, which does not pose a great threat to him.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Moreover, I have been aware of this problem for a long time, and I have taken the initiative to discuss this matter with Dickpolis several times, but he has turned me away several times and made me a joke to the people of Thurii. I believe you can't have missed it. been!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Sostatus put on a look of grievance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Theos was silent for a moment: the stalemate in the relationship between Sostatus and Dicopolis has become a joke among the people of Turii, how could he I don't know. He didn't want to deal with this difficult matter, but several friends in the Chamber of Commerce asked him for help, and he didn't want to see the originally united Turiyi Chamber of Commerce continue to have disputes, so he intervened.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, he had to sincerely persuade again: "Dikpolis refused to discuss with you, which caused the problem to intensify. This is of course his fault! However, it is not without reason that he is angry with you. Of course, he understands that we can only allow us to It is impossible to sell goods to mainland Greece and not allow Greek merchants to trade on the kingdom's land. But merchants from other kingdoms will not have any objections to the introduction of fine Athenian pottery. Only you can't because of your sales. The channels are too wide!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Look, in just a short time, you helped Athenian Pottery open up the sales channels for the upper echelons of the kingdom. Even if Dicopolis tried his best to improve the quality of his pottery, he still couldn't keep up with the speed of selling pottery as you did. You even... Sold the pottery to the royal family..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Wait a minute!" Saustatus interrupted: "Your Majesty wants to buy the Athenian pottery I sell. It is not my recommendation. It was the palace director Ribazo who took the initiative to find me. , and he repeatedly warned me and mentioned the name of the pottery merchant with whom I cooperated several times. I guess... His Majesty has known about his fellow countryman for a long time." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty's fellow countryman?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, This pottery merchant's name is Heskraus, a native of Peleus..." Saustatus pretended to be trying to remember, and said slowly: "I remember when I went to visit my brother-in-law Hieros, in a The merchant Peleus whom I met at the banquet, the person who introduced him to me at that time was Gorgione, the new intelligence chief of Thessaly..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now it was Theos's turn to feel nervous: merchant Peleus... intelligence chief Recommendation... The upper echelons of Thurii all know that the Kingdom Intelligence Department mainly serves His Majesty Davos!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Theos immediately asked: "This Hesskraus is His Majesty's relative in Peleus?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I don't know that." Saustatus spread his hands and shrugged: "I think so Even Mr. Ribazo himself doesn't know, but no one knows if His Majesty is clear."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Theos frowned and fell into deep thought. After a while, he said seriously: "It seems that this I can't blame you, but as the president of the Turiyi Chamber of Commerce, you should understand that if the conflict between you and him is not resolved as soon as possible, it will have a great impact on the chamber of commerce if it continues... Let's do this, he will come over later, and I will convince him first. Him, and then I will act as the mediator, and you will discuss with him, and both parties will make some concessions, and we will try to resolve this conflict tonight. What do you think?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is exactly what I hope." Sostatu Si responded with some confusion: "But is Dickpolis coming today? My servant told me that he did not respond to my invitation."
  </font>
