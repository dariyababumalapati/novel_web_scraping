  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "If the Sidisini people are still stubborn and refuse to listen to advice, then summon all the forces that signed the road construction agreement and vote collectively to punish the Sidisini people who violated the agreement and repeatedly refused to listen to advice. The Sini people carry out military punishment!" Davos said with a majestic look and powerful words: "Theonia can sit on the throne of the leader of the central Italian alliance because of our strong strength. If the Sidi Sini people insist on jumping If they come out to provoke us, then they can use their blood to establish our prestige!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes!" Alexis responded slightly excitedly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "In addition... after the resolution of 'forming a border force' is passed by the Senate, Anxi Thanos, go and talk to the Etruscan envoy to see if you can build a road from Rome to the northern border of Etruria. This will help transport food and supplies to the army stationed there in the future." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty. , this is a good idea! Building the highway will also help the connection between the kingdom and Etruria, making mutual trade and personnel exchanges closer!" Marij said slightly excitedly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "However, after the Gauls' army invades the Etruscan territory in a large scale, they can also use the highway to reach Rome more quickly." Lysias expressed concern.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This is a good thing." Davos said disapprovingly: "We are not afraid of fighting the Gauls head-on. Instead, we hide in the mountains and carry out raids like now, which is a bit of a headache." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty, I will send someone there. Negotiate with the Etruscan envoys on this matter. I believe that under the current situation, they should agree to this proposal." Ansitanos responded, he paused briefly, and then said: "Yesterday, Sinumi Envoys from several tribes in Biya came to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, hoping to meet with His Majesty."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "For what purpose?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is also about the Masili tribe. They provoked conflicts and sent troops to invade the territories of these tribes. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Masili tribe..." Davos tapped the armrest with his fingers, pondered for a moment, and said: "...Although at the end of the last war, we had an agreement with the East and West Numibians not to interfere. Their internal affairs, and also had a secret agreement with the Masili tribe...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, we can no longer turn a blind eye to the Masili tribe's continuous intrusions into other tribes, because this will not only affect the trust of other Numibian tribes in us , and a unified West Numbia is not in our interests. The ambitions of the Masili tribe must be stopped!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Uh... I remember another large tribe in West Numbia called... called Padu and the Masili tribe. The tribe has a grudge and is relatively submissive to us. You send someone to contact the tribe secretly and tell them, 'Theonia supports them in uniting other tribes against Masili and is willing to provide material support.'" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Okay, Your Majesty, I will do it immediately." Ansitanos understood immediately, but after thinking about it, he reminded: "There are several tribes' territories separated between the Padu tribe and Masili. The current leader has a gentle personality. Under actual threats, they may not agree."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos stroked his chin with his hand, thought for a while, and then said: "If Pardue rejects our suggestion, then let the Ministry of Foreign Affairs take action to convince the West. Most of the leaders of Numibia filed an application with the Kingdom, strongly requesting the Kingdom to intervene in this conflict and restore peace to West Numibia... In this way, we will not violate the agreement." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Understood." Ansitanos had actually had this idea in his mind for a long time, but he just asked Davos to take the initiative to express it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, does our Ministry of Military Affairs want to prepare for the conflict in West Numbia?" Alexis asked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos nodded: "Regardless of whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' mission is successful or not, your Ministry of Military Affairs must first ask the staff office to conduct war deductions based on the premise of diplomatic failure and military intervention, and then make preparations based on the results of the deductions, so as to truly It can be used immediately when needed."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos looked at Lysias again and said, "Although Carthage has been quiet in the past few years, we cannot relax our vigilance. The intelligence department will step up its efforts. Surveillance of it. Isn't the administrator of Hadrumentum Litagus?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Your Majesty."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Tell him about it so that he too will be prepared."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Got Lysias's After responding again, Davos looked at everyone and asked again: "Are there any other questions?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, the construction process of the main temple of Hades is accelerating. In two days, the location of the giant statue on the top of the mountain will be determined. After the design, we have to start carving and modeling. I believe that the main temple of Hades will be completed before next year's celebration." Heraclid said as if he wanted to take credit for building the great city.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Very good!" Davos praised lightly. He did not want to talk more about the temple reconstruction at the administrative meeting, because at the beginning, under Plessinas' proposal, he received the support of many senators and ministers. support, but some are still opposed, not only because the war has just ended and the country has not yet fully recovered. It is a waste of time and money to build such a large public building, but also because there will be special ceremonies when the main temple is built, allowing a small number of people to People are worried...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It seems that you have no other questions." Davos changed the subject and said slowly: "As for the last time you raised the question, 'In view of the vast territory of the kingdom, in order to facilitate the management of the kingdom, we hope to divide it into I have already made a decision on the proposal of establishing the province and the position of permanent governor."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as these words came out, everyone suddenly became energetic and listened attentively.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos saw this in his eyes and continued calmly: "I think your proposal is correct. Just like what I just said, 'the situation in the kingdom has changed, the situation has changed, and the old system will also follow. Change to adapt to new developments.' However, the two terms 'province and governor' are derived from Persia and do not match our Theonia. I am more accustomed to using the term 'region and regional administrator' Two words are used instead to show the difference between the Kingdom of Theonia and Persia."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Region and chief executive..." Everyone whispered these two nouns.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, these two terms are better, easy to understand, and correspond to our two words 'city and city chief'. Even ordinary people can understand the meaning." Even Ansita, who is a scholar, Nostal said this, and others had no objections.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos smiled and said, "Henny, go bring up the map of the kingdom."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The word "lift" is used because this map was drawn on a huge wooden board. It not only showed the existing territory of the kingdom, but included all areas of the entire Western Mediterranean. Of course, other areas were depicted. are not as detailed and accurate as those within the Kingdom, so that the area north of the Iberian Peninsula and the Italian Peninsula is basically a blur.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos stepped down from the throne, took the long wooden pole from Henepolis, used it to draw on the map and said: "The far north, the towns we have in Latium and the Etruria north of the Taibo River The sub-towns were merged into the Roman region, and a Roman administrator was established, with the seat of government in Rome; the
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   towns of Campania, Samone and Enona that we have were merged into the eastern region of Campania, with the seat of Benevento Grumantum;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   further south, the towns of the original Lucania and the three coastal towns of Poseidonia, Elea, and Picossis were merged into the Lucania region, with the seat of Grumentum;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   the original The towns of Bruti and Laos were merged into the Bruti region, governed in Cosenza;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   the original Apulian region was divided into The Dauni region, the Pucheti region, the Messapian region, the Dauni region is located in Lucenia, the Pucetti region is located in Silvim, the Mesapian region is located in Udiae;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Heraclea and Metapontum was incorporated into the Turii Region, and the seat of government is still here—" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty, does Bisinia belong to the Bruti Region or the Turii Region?" Sedorum asked softly. One sentence.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Oh, I just made a slip of the tongue. Bisignia still belongs to the Thurii region." Davos immediately corrected it, and then said: "Crimissa, Asproustum, Crotone , Silitium were merged into the Crotone region, and the government was in Crotone;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Trina, Hibernian, Colonia, Medma, and Locle were merged into the southern region of Magna Graecia, and the government was in Trina. ;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Taurina, Regim, Messina, Mylai, Tyndares and the unfinished Himera (after the old city of Himera was destroyed by the Carthaginians, no one dared to go there for decades. The town was rebuilt, but after the Western Mediterranean War, the entire Sicily had been placed under the rule of the Kingdom of Theonia. Sipulos, who was the wartime governor of Sicily at the time, made a suggestion to rebuild the city of Himera. Two reasons: First, that This area is the only relatively broad, flat lowland on the northern coast of Sicily, and the soil is fertile, which is conducive to the settlement of a larger population; secondly, because it was less affected by the war, some Greek city-states on the northern coast were not incorporated after the war. The Kingdom of Theonia is instead attached to Theonia and becomes an autonomous city-state like Tarantum. Due to the early surrender of Sorus and Palermos, Theonia abides by its promise and allows them to be autonomous. Myra is located exactly in the center of the north coast. Its establishment is conducive to the stability of the north coast of Sicily) and merged into the Strait area. The governance is-"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos paused and said: "Lijim and Messina."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   These words As soon as it came out, the ministers were surprised, but Mariji thought for a moment and immediately praised loudly: "Your Majesty is wise! Turning Lijim and Messina into one region will be conducive to the unified management of shipping issues in the Messina Strait area. ! Setting the seat of government in Messina and Lijim at the same time will be more conducive to resolving the conflicts between the people of the two towns for hundreds of years!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, the ancestors of many people in these two cities came from the same ally, and the distance between the two cities is only 10 Haili, but due to interest issues, there have been constant conflicts. Even after joining the kingdom, this is still the case. I have gone to mediate several times.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This time, His Majesty designated these two cities as regional governance centers at the same time, which is helpful. It is a great initiative for officials and the people to work together to resolve conflicts and improve the efficiency of governance for the common benefit!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos smiled and said nothing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "But the administrative offices are in Messina and Lijim at the same time. It may be difficult to manage." Mentotic Els asked with some confusion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thanks to the other side of remembrance for the tip!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your support is my biggest motivation for writing!
