   Chapter 1313 Battle of Taposakus (5)
  </font>
 </font>

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the Persian sickle chariot is a terrifying weapon for rushing into battle, in the face of the prepared tactics of the Theonian army, it was either shot by light infantry or legionnaires. Destroyed, the damage caused to the Theonia army formation was extremely slight.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Due to the dust and fog raised by the chariots and war elephants as they advanced, Artaxerxes and Trebassus, several hundred meters away, could not see the battle situation on the opposite side at all. Once the attack was launched, it must continue according to the pre-planned plan. Execution, so soon after the chariots and war elephants were dispatched, the King of Persia sent 3,000 armored cavalry in the front line in the middle, hoping that they could follow the impact of the chariots and war elephants and completely break through the Theonian army formation.

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Persian undead army not only includes infantry, but also chariots and cavalry. These 3,000 armored cavalry are part of the undead army. They are the elite selected from the huge Persian cavalry. They also ride the strongest and tallest war horses with hoods. The cavalrymen wore full leather armor and carried long Persian sabers. They were also equipped with double-edged hand axes and bows and arrows.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the traditional tactics of the Undead Army, the cavalry team launches the second round of attacks on the enemy's formation after the chariot convoy. It is often able to defeat the enemy without waiting for the infantry to come out. This time they also hope to repeat the same trick.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the King of Persia gave the order, the cavalry began to jog forward in three rows across the entire front line of the center (the reason why they did not adopt a dense rhombus array was that Trebassus considered that the impact of chariots and war elephants must have already hit the enemy). The Theonian military formation has caused damage, and the cavalry's charge is not greatly hindered. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the attack range of the cavalry as much as possible and cause a larger area of ​​damage to the Theonian array, making it difficult to recover. , allowing the subsequent infantry charge to completely defeat the center of the Theonian army).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the cavalry encountered some troubles not long after they set off. They ran into the fleeing war elephants. These giant beasts, which had become sensitive and irritable due to injuries, saw the Persian cavalry rushing towards them and thought it was disadvantageous for them, so they Angrily shaking their trunks, trampling and charging, disrupting the cavalry's charging formation, the war elephants, eyes red with anger, strode towards the Persian infantry formation in front. The mahout on the elephant's back had to endure the pain. Drive long iron nails into the brain of the war elephant, causing it to suddenly fall to the ground with a scream.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There were also a handful of war elephants that threw off the mahout on their backs while running out of control, and crashed straight into the dense infantry array, causing a commotion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Artaxerxes witnessed this situation and felt a little uneasy: "Trebassus, what is going on?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Trebassus did not dare to respond directly, but urgently reminded: "Your Majesty, Immortal The cavalry has been dispatched, it's time to launch a full-scale attack!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Now?" This was a plan that had been drawn up, but when things came to a close, Artaxerxes seemed a little hesitant.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Artaxerxes' hesitation did not make Trebassus feel dissatisfied. On the contrary, he was grateful that the Persian king's attention was diverted. Having led troops on many expeditions, he knew that the biggest shortcoming of war elephants was that they were difficult to control. In the past, Collisions with his own military formations also happened from time to time, but never so many as in today's battle. At this moment, he had no time to think about the reasons. He just urged loudly: "Chariots, war elephants and cavalry have already arrived one after another. We have launched an attack on the Theonian middle army formation. We must seize this opportunity to launch a full-scale attack and completely defeat the enemy on the opposite side!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Trebasus's words temporarily dispelled the haze rising again in Artaxerxes' heart. , he cheered up and nodded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hearing the high-pitched bugles and seeing the Persian messengers running past the front shouting, Remy took a deep breath. He knew that the important moment that decided the life and death of his tribe was finally coming, and he felt suddenly heavy. There was a bit of relief mixed in, because he had been suffering for a while and now it was finally coming to an end.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He looked back at the Persian commander in the rear who kept shouting for an attack, with a scornful smile on his face.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the front of the far right wing of the Persian army formation, Mardonius, who was waiting impatiently, received the order from the Persian king conveyed by the messenger. He immediately turned from anger to joy, and eagerly waved the long saber in his hand: "Attack ! Attack!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reason why he was so excited was not only because he was not only a descendant of Gobrias, but also a descendant of Mardonios, the commander of the Persian army who commanded the battle of Plataea. Si died heroically on the battlefield, but because of his failure in the Battle of Platia, he was criticized by the Persian nobles, which also affected the reputation of the entire family.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mardonios has decided to make his first contribution in this battle and clear the family's reputation.
  </font>

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The undead cavalry's horizontal formation was very long, and the slight chaos caused by the retreat of more than a dozen war elephants was not enough to affect The entire team advanced, but the rain of arrows fired by thousands of Theonian light infantry caused great trouble to the Persian cavalry.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Megakides was satisfied to see the Persian cavalry in the distance rolling down to the ground with their horses and men. Just as he was about to draw out the second arrow, the shouts of the officers rang in his ears, but the battlefield was too noisy, so he He couldn't hear it clearly, and he didn't react, but the teammates next to him pulled him and shouted: "Retreat! Retreat quickly!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Megakides was dragged back by his teammates, and he said loudly and unwillingly: "Retreat!" If you have time, you can shoot another arrow!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Bullshit!" his teammates scolded: "It will take time for the heavy infantry to form a formation!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Megakides was speechless. In traditional Greek battles, the light infantry served as an auxiliary, attacking and retreating. He makes the decision entirely by himself, and in the Theonian army, various arms need to work closely together. As a new recruit, he has not yet fully adapted.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Megakides and his teammates quickly fled into the infantry formation, while Alsinis and other team officers looked ahead nervously. The Persian cavalry came very quickly and was already very close to the infantry formation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Javelin!" Alsinis roared, and the legionnaires who had been prepared threw their javelins with all their strength.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This was a more terrifying wave of death than the previous arrow rain. The armor of Persian cavalry and war horses was easily penetrated by heavy javelins, and they fell in pieces amidst screams and lamentations. It also hindered the advancement of the cavalry behind them. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Taking advantage of the chaos in the enemy's formation, the rear detachment phalanx after throwing the javelin quickly rushed up and connected with the front phalanx, but at the same time, it also blocked some light infantry who had not been able to evacuate to the rear of the array in time. outside.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The undead cavalry who were lucky enough to escape the long-range attack never expected that the Theonian military formation could remain so intact after experiencing the impact of chariots and war elephants. Although they were surprised, as the most elite and bravest soldiers in Persia , they had already rushed to the front of the formation, facing the heavily guarded shield formation and spear wall, and continued to rush forward without any hesitation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the intensive stabbing spears hit the war horse, they were unable to stop the huge kinetic energy contained in the continuous running of the weight of nearly a thousand kilograms. Amidst the screams of the war horses, the sound of "Boom! Boom! Boom!..." continued. , accompanied by exclamations, the soldiers in front of it were knocked out, and small gaps appeared in the military formation in the middle.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But it is a pity that the Persian cavalry only had three horizontal lines, and it was weakened a lot by arrows and javelins. After this round of impact, it could no longer continue, and the Persian infantry array was still halfway forward, so The Theonian Legion soldiers quickly eliminated these undead cavalry trapped in the formation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, it seems that our infantry phalanx has blocked the impact of the Persian cavalry, and there are not too many casualties... There is no need to use reserves to replace them for the time being." Felicius, who has been paying close attention to the battle situation in the middle Si said loudly happily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Amyntas, Epithenes and other veteran generals heard this, they all breathed a sigh of relief: They have been in the military all their lives and have extremely rich war experience, but like today's battle, chariots, war elephants, and armored cavalry took turns to attack the military formation. I have never encountered a thrilling scene before. Although I had careful planning in advance, I was still sweating.

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos looked calm and kept staring ahead. Countless figures were vaguely visible on the dusty and foggy battlefield.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The Persian infantry is coming up, and the cavalry on both sides of them should also start attacking..." Davos said calmly, paused, and asked: "Have our slingers started attacking?" The
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Persians The all-out attack has just begun. The Balearic slingers are located on both wings of the military formation, eight or nine miles away from the command center in the middle. No matter how fast the messengers reporting the battle situation run, they cannot reach Davos in an instant. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Felicius was speechless for a moment, but Tormid reacted quickly: "Your Majesty, please rest assured! Although Balearic citizens have been less recruited after Balearic merged with the kingdom, they have participated in the Iberian military camp for many years. There is no problem with training and cooperation with other arms. I believe they will complete the tasks assigned by Your Majesty very well!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos nodded after hearing this and said leisurely: "As long as we can defeat the Persian cavalry again , I have nothing to worry about in this war."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ... Amidst the continuous shouts in various tones, more than 30,000 cavalrymen on both wings began to advance one after another, like a flood overflowing an embankment, their momentum was far more terrifying than the attack of the infantry in the center.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Looking at the wall of dust rolling in the distance ahead, the commander of the First Cavalry Corps, Cuccius, didn't have any nervousness on his face. He even turned around and looked around leisurely.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "450 meters!... 450 meters!... 450 meters!" The observers at the forefront of the Theonian military formation reported the distance between the Persian cavalry troops and the military formation to the Baliari slingers at the rear of the military formation. These soldiers Apart from carrying a sling and several lead shot bags, they had no other protection on their bodies. After the cavalry on the opposite side was dispatched, they began to swing the sling under the command of the team officer.
