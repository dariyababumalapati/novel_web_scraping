   Chapter 1163 Alliance with Arcadia
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although everyone here does not know much about the difficulties Thebes is facing today, they have never thought of asking Thebes to provide assistance and fight against Sparta, so Ipa Merunda's candid apology made everyone, led by Clotokatax, both a little surprised and a little moved.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax immediately said: "General Epamelonda, Thebes is facing difficulties now and cannot support us. We can understand this, so your Majesty specially sent enough soldiers to the Peloponnese. To deal with Sparta, our Theonian power alone is enough. When Sparta is completely defeated, we will lead the army north to help you eliminate other threats and completely restore peace to Thebes!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " Lotokatax was not a promise made casually because of temporary excitement. He considered that since the Kingdom of Theonia wants to dominate the situation in Greece, it is likely to have conflicts with Athens and Thessaly in the future. Using the excuse of helping the ally Thebes can not only gain Thebes' gratitude and assistance, but also conceal the true purpose. Why not?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors also took this into consideration, so when Crotokatax made his promise, he did not interrupt or cover it up.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing this, the army commanders such as Olivers and Tygetilus learned that besides Sparta, there were other battles to fight, so they naturally agreed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ipamironda looked quite moved, and he said emotionally: "When I go back, I will definitely tell every Theban person that what Dionya has done for Thebes will make me happy." The Thebans should never forget your kindness! My Majesty Apollo, I swear in your name that I will do my best to make Thebes the strongest ally of Theonia in Greece!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Ipamelonda was halfway When he knelt on his knees, raised his palms to the sky, and solemnly swore an oath, Clotokatax was a little stunned. He suddenly felt a little ashamed, and quickly stepped forward to help him up: "General Ipamilonda, you... What are you..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Compared to the great help you Theonia has given to Thebes, this is all I can do." Ipamironda said sincerely.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax was a little moved and didn't know what to say.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Epamironda spoke again: "Now you are at war with Sparta. Thebes is temporarily unable to send troops to fight, but we have persuaded the Arcadians to support you." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I have heard about this from my predecessor .
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The commander has said it." Clotokatax frowned and said as gently as possible: "However, I heard that Sparta has sent an envoy to restore friendship with the Arcadians, so Arcadia The Dia people have not sent an envoy to ask for help from us yet."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ipamironda smiled slightly and said seriously: "The Arcadian Alliance has just been established, and the city-states it belongs to have always been allies of Sparta. Facing Sparta, It was a rare show of goodwill from the Badans, and hesitation was inevitable. However, the leader of the Arcadian Alliance was Mantinia. The city of Mantinia was once destroyed by Sparta, and the Mantinians were displaced for ten years. For several years, they had had deep hatred against the Spartans, and it was impossible for them to make peace with the Spartans. What's
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   more, Lycomedes, the chief general of Mandinia, was the main person who promoted the establishment of the Arcadian Alliance. He has a high reputation not only in Mantinia but also in the entire Arcadia region. He once went to Thebes as an envoy to ask for help, but was persuaded by us to ask for help from Theonia instead. Before coming I spent a few days with him on the way to Messenia. I think he is a very wise and farsighted man. He will definitely not allow the Spartan conspiracy to succeed!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the general said so. , then we will wait a little longer." Clotokatax agreed with Ipamilonda's suggestion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Olivers next to him had some objections to this and wanted to express his opinion, but Printols stopped him with his eyes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   His unwilling look fell into the eyes of Ipamilonda, who seemed not to have seen him and continued to talk to Clotokatax calmly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two sides exchanged some views and suggestions on "how to defeat the Spartans", and later even exchanged views on "how to train soldiers and how to organize the army". Even the captains of the Olivers also joined in, The conversation lasted for more than three hours, and until Ipamilonda took her leave and left, the others were still impressed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Looking at his leaving figure, Clotokatax couldn't help but sigh: "Ipamilonda is not only very insightful in military matters, but also very knowledgeable in knowledge, and he is also so humble and eager to learn. What a wonderful person." A respected old man!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What a pity." Printors said in a deep voice: "We have come to Greece, which will definitely limit the continued growth of Thebes, and Ipamironda may not have the opportunity to continue to display his talents. Chance!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "But at least more Thebans were prevented from dying." Clotokatax said softly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Highness." Olivers interjected: "Do we really have to wait for the Arcadians to make a decision before leading the army to attack the Spartans from the north?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Uncle Olivers." Crotocatak Although Si's tone was gentle, his expression was firm: "The situation in Peloponnese is complicated. We cannot be anxious, otherwise we may turn those who are supposed to be friends into enemies."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ……………………………… …………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Facts have proved that Ipamilonda's judgment was not wrong, and Crotocatacus's waiting was also correct. On the second day after Ipamilonda left Messenia, The Arcadian envoys arrived, headed by none other than Lycomedes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Originally he just came to ask for help, but in Messenia he saw the powerful army of Theonia, and the Theonia army was fully helping the Messenians rebuild the new Messenian government and the city of Messenia .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After thinking about it, Lycomedes changed his mind and decided to form an alliance with Theonia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crotokatax held talks with him as the commander of the Theonian expeditionary force and as a prince.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After two days of consultation, the two sides initially drafted a resolution, the main content of which is: Theonia recognizes the Arcadian Alliance and ensures that the interests of its alliance are not infringed; the
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Arcadian Alliance also recognizes Messenia , will maintain friendly exchanges with it;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Theonia will assist the Arcadian Alliance in building the city of Megalobilis as a symbol of friendship between the two parties;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Theonia and the Arcadian Alliance will form a military alliance, on one side When invaded by a powerful enemy, the other side will provide full assistance.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And if we want to attack the enemy together, we will only target Sparta...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Judging from this alliance treaty, the Theonia side undoubtedly suffered some losses, but Crotokatax, Printols and others had reached an agreement during private discussions: as long as they can get the With the support of the people in the Arcadia region in the center of the Peloponnese (even if it is just neutral), Theonia's attack on Sparta will undoubtedly be much smoother, and it doesn't hurt to suffer some losses temporarily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the agreement was reached, Lycomedes did not stay in Messenia longer, and immediately returned to Arcadia, preparing to persuade the alliance so that the agreement could be finally passed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax also sent a messenger to bring the agreement back to Thurii for Davos to review.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This back and forth will naturally take some time. During this period, under the advice of Printors, Crotocatacus suspended the soldiers to continue their construction activities, and all were replaced by Messenians, who began to strengthen the army. training, and he stayed at the training ground every day, supervising the army's training while also letting the soldiers get used to his presence.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The alliance agreement with the Arcadian Alliance was quickly approved after it was presented to King Davos.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the Arcadian Alliance has caused a lot of controversy on this matter. In fact, the members of the entire alliance have had different opinions on the issue of "Accept Sparta's peace proposal? Or ask for help from Theonia?" Due to minor differences, Lycomedas also spent a lot of energy before the alliance finally agreed to ask for help from Theonia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is said that the Spartans were conservative, and the Arcadians were even worse than them.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is because the Arcadia region is located in the center of the Peloponnese Peninsula. It is not close to the sea and is mostly mountainous. It is relatively isolated geographically. The local people are very wary of external forces.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Among them, the situation of the Mandinians is much better. After all, they have been wandering for more than ten years and have more knowledge.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A hundred years ago, Queen Tegea and Ochomenus were the most determined opponents.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tegea is located in the southeast of the region. Since joining the Peloponnesian League a hundred years ago, Sparta has always used it as a barrier to the north of Laconia. Therefore, it has long used methods of both suppression and cooptation. As a result, after Tegea joined the Arcadian Alliance, there are still many pro-Spartan people in the country, so when Sparta sent envoys to sue for peace from the alliance, it was the most active; and Okomenus Located to the east of Arcadia and adjacent to Pisa, the two have a close relationship. When the Olympian Games were held, Ochomenus even shared some interests, such as allowing Ochomenus merchants to go to some good areas in Olympia. Setting up stalls and allowing the priests of Ochomenus to participate in the games... However, Pisa was fully supported by Sparta, which made the feelings of the Okomenus towards Sparta very complicated...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In these A From the perspective of the city-states of the Cardian League, independence from Sparta was a last resort, but it was unacceptable to help a foreign force fight against Sparta, even though Lycomedas argued that "in order to protect For the security of the Arcadian Union, this is just a stop-gap measure." The MPs from these city-states still found it difficult to accept.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, for several days, the Arcadian Alliance Council debated endlessly on the issue of "alliance with Theonia".
