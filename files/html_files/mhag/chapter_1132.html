   Chapter 1132 Conflict in Contract Negotiations
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Two nights later, a grand dinner was held in the Theonia Palace. In addition to King Davos and Xenophon, the guests at the banquet were also Hilos, Alexis, and Aminta. Si, Philisius, Agcia, Thormids, Capus, Antonius, Epithenes, Matonis, Oliviers, Geogris...even Princess Christoya was present Had a banquet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the banquet, everyone recalled their adventures in Persia, thanked the mercenary leaders such as Davos and Xenophon for finally taking them out of danger, and toasted to them one after another. The scene was quite lively.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Others lamented the wealthy life they enjoy today and regretted the wrong choices made by Cleannos, Timazon, and Xenophon.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, some people advised Xenophon to leave Sparta, settle in Theonia, and enjoy the rest of his life with his former comrades, but Xenophon was perfunctory.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the banquet was about to end, when Xenophon toasted to Davos, he boldly asked with the strength of his wine: "Now that Theonia is so powerful, why did it behave so badly in the face of Sparta ending the friendly agreement early?" So tolerant?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos squinted his drunken eyes and told the story calmly: "A few years ago, in order to show its respect, Mauritania sent several elephants to the kingdom and kept them in captivity next to the palace. The hound barked at the elephant from a distance because of fear, but the elephant remained quiet and regarded it as nothing. After a while, the hound stopped barking and both parties were in peace..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xenophon visited the zoo in the past two days. Knowing how huge the elephant's body is, I was silent for a while after listening.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Spartan envoys quickly returned to Sparta. After learning that King Theonia calmly accepted the "Spartan end of friendly agreement" without any intention of punishment, the elders and supervisors breathed a sigh of relief. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was just that when Xenophon visited Agesilaus, he described in detail what he had seen in the Kingdom of Theonia, and solemnly reminded: "Although Theonia has no ill intentions towards Sparta now, it is best to It is still necessary to re-sign a contract with Theonia and restore friendship as soon as possible!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is an obvious question, but Agesilaus thought about it for a while before saying solemnly: "You are right, we are The peace talks between Bess and Athens must be held as soon as possible, and the contract must be signed as soon as possible, so that Sparta can have the confidence to negotiate with Theonia."
  </font>

 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   BC (Theonia) In the spring of the twenty-third year of the Holy Kingdom of Nia), the Theban War, which had lasted for many years, finally ushered in the dawn of peace.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   With the support of Persia, the two sides of the war will conduct peace talks, and the location of the peace talks will be in the city of Sparta.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since it was Sparta's home court, the major city-states of the Peloponnesian League sent envoys to participate in the peace talks, and they were the first to arrive at the venue.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Next came the Athenian envoy, with the chief general of Athens, Callistratus, as the main person in charge, and his assistant was Callias, the torchbearer of the Eleusinian Mysteries.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The last to arrive was the Theban envoys, headed by Epamirondas.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, Persia also sent envoys to participate in this meeting.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as the meeting began, Athens launched an attack on Sparta. Callias and Callistratus successively accused the Spartans of being arbitrary and oppressing their allies, and were the culprits of the war. At the same time, they pointed out the war with compassion. The harm caused to the city-states in mainland Greece aroused the resonance of the envoys from the city-states present.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus and Archidamus, who attended the meeting in Sparta, seemed to feel wronged and did not immediately refute.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, all the envoys present quickly reached a consensus: stop the war.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It seems that the Athenians are still siding with Thebes against the Spartans, but in fact, through Tamagoras's contact with Luticli in Persia, the two sides have secretly reached a certain tacit understanding.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a result, this tacit understanding was revealed in the subsequent discussions about negotiating and signing the contract.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Both Athens and Sparta claimed that according to Persian suggestions, the basis for establishing peace was still the principle established by the "King's Contract", that is, all city-states must withdraw their troops (whether army or navy) stationed in other states. Any alliance had to be dissolved, leaving all Greek city-states to remain autonomous.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a result, there is a big problem, which is also a problem that cannot be solved after the end of the Corinthian War and the signing of the 'Great King's Contract': the Athenian League and the Peloponnesian League do not comply with the regulations and should be disbanded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So Epamilonda, who had been quietly watching the Athenian performance before, immediately pointed out this problem loudly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Unexpectedly, Athens and the Spartans were already prepared. Callistratus immediately admitted that there were indeed flaws in the original 'King's Contract'. He believed that it should be revised and the clauses should be changed to: No city-states shall be forced to Become a member of the alliance, but different city-states can cooperate with each other according to their wishes, but they cannot make treaties to make rigid provisions.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus immediately agreed with this. He believed that such modifications were more reasonable and more acceptable to various city-states.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Envoys from other Peloponnesian city-states also expressed their approval, and with the support of the Persian envoys, the terms of the contract were confirmed and the signing was awaited.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   One by one, the envoys from the Peloponnesian city-state rushed to sign the name of the city-state, followed by Athens and Sparta. Finally, it was the envoy from Thebes' turn, and everyone's eyes were focused on them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ipamilonda stood up with a solemn expression, solemnly swore an oath in the name of Zeus, then picked up a pen and wrote her name on the oath.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Most of the people in the stadium breathed a sigh of relief, but they heard Agesilaus say in a deep voice: "People of Thebes, you signed the wrong name."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ipamilonda said very firmly: "I have confirmed it." Yes, there is no mistake in signing!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, other people in the venue felt that something was wrong. They rushed to pick up the oath and saw it clearly written: Boeotia, Ipamilonda.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus said angrily : "Ipamilonda, are you fooling us?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone knows that Boeosia is a region, and Thebes is just a city-state in this region. What right does it have to sign on behalf of all the city-states in the Boiosia region?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Epamironda was not afraid at all. He looked at Agesilaus and said calmly: "What's so strange about this? You can think of Boiosia as Laconia. Nea is the area where the Spartans lived), or -"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Epamilonda turned to look at Callistratus again, and said very forcefully: "Attica, not Peloponnese The Caesar League, or the Athenian Maritime League!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as these words came out, the envoys from other city-states in the venue were shocked: The ambition of the Thebans was fully revealed. They wanted to unify Boeoxia!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus immediately retorted: "When the Greeks talk about Athens, they are not just referring to the city of Athens, but the entire Attica region; when the Greeks talk about Sparta, they are also referring to The entire Laconia region; but when people talk about Thebes, are they referring to the entire Boeotia? Obviously, they are referring to only the city-state of Thebes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Why is this? That is because Athens and Sparta were in A region had been integrated into one region long ago, and over a long period of time, other Greeks recognized this. Unfortunately, they could not agree that Thebes represented Boiosia, because until Many city-states in the Boeotian region are still independent."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus then said in a stern voice: "According to this oath, Thebes must dissolve your newly established Boeotian alliance and let each one be under your control. The city-state of Boeotia will gain independence and freedom!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ipamelonda pushed Agesilaus back without showing any signs of weakness: "If you, Sparta, let every town in Laconia gain independence, Then our Piotian Alliance will be disbanded!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then, he looked at Agesilaus and Callistratus with a firm expression, and argued forcefully: "You Spartans have no right to interfere with Pio The internal affairs of Xia, just like we Thebes have no right to interfere with the internal management of Laconia; Laconia, Boiosia and Attica each represent completely different political systems. Under the witness of Zeus, Every form of government was legitimate; Boeotia's alliance with Attica and its development into a city were as natural as the development of Lagnia into an oligarchy subordinate to Sparta. With legality -"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Archidamus, the son of Agesilaus, interrupted him loudly: "You are talking nonsense! You Thebans just want to continue to wage war and attack other Pio. Xia city-state, depriving them of their independence and freedom, this is never allowed!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ipamilonda sneered: "Didn't you Spartans do this before! Shamelessly captured our city, and in Other Boeotian city-states sent garrisons and officers to deprive them of their independence and freedom. It is because of your aggression that we Boeotians realized that we must unite together to ensure the freedom of our Boeotian people!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Archidam Si was speechless for a moment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Epamironda then said sternly to Agesilaus: "For this Boeotian alliance, we in Thebes have indeed taken some strong measures, but you Spartans have no right to interfere, because no one can In the ancient times when time was accurate, your ancestors took tougher and high-pressure measures, and the country you maintained was established by them in this tough way.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now the friendly allies of Thebes and Boeotia have also decided to Take the same approach as your Spartans and establish a united and unified Boeotian Union that includes all the Boeotian city-states. In order to achieve this great goal, our citizens will not be afraid of death!" Thanks
