   Chapter 1133 The Thebes' Decision
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus was so taken away by Ipamironda's sonorous and powerful words and the fearless look on his face that he was stunned for a moment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing that the situation was not good, Callistratus was about to speak to resolve it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But I heard the Persian envoy Datis sternly say: "After signing a contract, you must act in accordance with the contract, stop all wars, and restore peace in Greece. This is the desire of the people of the Greek city-states, and it is also the urgent request of the great Persian king! After this, if any city-state dares to provoke another war or invade another country, Persia will strongly support the other city-states that signed the contract to form a coalition and severely punish them! People of Thebes, I advise you to honor the contract obediently! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Epamironda sneered a few times and looked directly at the Persian envoy, with a cold light in her eyes: "Because we believed in your words from Persia, we signed the King's Contract and dissolved the Boeotian Alliance. The result! The result was Sparta. People broke the contract, attacked Thebes, captured our acropolis, and enslaved our people! What did you Persia do for this shameless violation of the contract? Nothing! So... Haha, what kind of peace? ! What independence! Let them all go to hell! We in Thebes only believe in ourselves now!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Ipamironda got excited, she even clenched her fists, causing the Persian envoy to subconsciously take a few steps back.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, Epamilonda did not punch the Persian envoy in the face, but turned around resolutely and walked out of the venue, followed by several other Thebans.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Theban envoys left in a hurry, and no one stopped them. For a while, there was silence in the venue.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Does this Theban signature count?" Callistratus' voice broke the silence.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Of course not!" Agesilaus said with a sullen face, "Since the Thebans have no intention of signing the contract, there is no need for us to force them in. I suggest that this signature be deleted!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Envoys from each city-state said one after another. Agreed, so did the Athenian envoy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The Thebans are arrogant and unreasonable. I'm afraid they will continue to wage war after they return. The King of Persia will never allow such a thing to happen!" At this time, the Persian envoy Datis shouted angrily: "We in Persia will strongly support you in forming an army. We must form an army to punish Thebes and maintain the sanctity of the peace treaty!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Datis is right, we should do this!" Agesilaus immediately looked at Callistratus: "You guys What do the Athenians think?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus said without hesitation: "We in Athens also support this decision. If Sparta wants to punish the Thebans, we will provide naval support, just like we helped Thebes. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Thebans have no navy at all, and the navy provided by Athens is completely useless... Agesilaus knew it, but he did not raise any objection, because he felt that regardless of the navy provided by Athens, it would be of no use to Thebans. Does Sparta have any actual help? The fact that Athens took this action is of great significance, allowing other city-states in mainland Greece to see that Athens is on the side of Sparta, and with this first support, There will be a second time, a third time... and the days to come are still long.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So Agesilaus immediately expressed his gratitude to the Athenian envoys.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While the envoys from each city-state continued to discuss the contract, the Theban envoys had already ridden out of Sparta and headed straight for the seaside port.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, a Theban envoy had time to complain: "Epamirondas, although your speech at the meeting just now was exciting, it will definitely anger Sparta and strengthen its attack on our Thebes! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Epamironda looked back at them and said in a deep voice: "Some of us still had some illusions about this peace talk before, but I believe they can give up completely now! Our ally Athens has betrayed us, Like the Spartans, they do not want us Thebes to unify the entire Boeotian region!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Ipamilonda, you are right!" Another Theban envoy said angrily: "In that contract Although it was said that 'the independence and freedom of each city-state must be ensured and the various alliances or alliances formed must be dissolved', it was also said that 'each city-state can voluntarily help each other'. Even if Athens and Sparta dissolved their alliance, by virtue of Due to the influence and strength of their city-states, those original allies will still voluntarily rely on them and be driven by them. Once we disband the Boeotian Alliance, it will soon become a mess!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Athens and Thebes are exactly that. They are worried that we will be able to confront them after integrating the Boeotian region, so they will try their best to stop us. We must not give in!" Ipamilonda said firmly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "But this time Sparta has the support of Athens and Persia, and its attack on us will be even more fierce!" The Theban envoy said worriedly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "We are not fighting alone. The Thessalians will fully support us, and we can also seek help from the Kingdom of Theonia." Ipamironda comforted them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Theonia has been in friendly contact with Sparta for more than ten years. Will they choose to help us?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I discussed this issue with Pelopidas and agreed that Persia and Theonia must have enmity. Since Now why did Sparta reach a contract, destroy the friendly agreement with the Kingdom of Theonia, and choose Persia? Then Theonia is likely to accept our suggestion and form an alliance with Thebes."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ipamironda The words made the remaining Theban envoys fall into deep thought.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "But no matter who we form an alliance with, we in Thebes must rely on our own strength to become stronger!" Ipamironda looked forward resolutely.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Two days later, the Athenian envoys also left Sparta and returned to their motherland.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the way, Callistratus was satisfied and said to Callias: "We in Athens have benefited the most and gained the most from this peace negotiation."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callias was a little puzzled: "The messenger in Persia Under the partiality of Sparta, we had to assist Sparta in attacking Thebes. This actually re-recognized Sparta's status as leader, and it should be Sparta's biggest gain."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Callistratus had some Despise this mediocre Athenian envoy, but as the torch bearer of the Eleusinian Mystery, Callias has considerable influence not only in Athens but also in the Peloponnese, otherwise this contract will end Nor will it be named after him: The Kalias Contract.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since Callistratus agreed to assist Sparta in attacking Thebes, he would definitely be criticized by some political opponents after returning to Athens. He needed the full protection of Callias, so he patiently explained to him : "Our Athens has been completely weakened since the Peloponnesian War. Not only was it controlled by Sparta, but it was also forced to dissolve all its allies. This is undoubtedly an extremely important event for Athens, which relies on maritime trade to prosper. It was a blow. After the Corinthian War, our national strength in Athens was somewhat restored, but the signing of the King's Contract forced us to once again disband the allies who had surrendered to us, until this time the contract was signed..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus emphasized The tone said: "Sparta has recognized the existence of the Athenian Maritime Alliance, which has actually placed Athens on the same status as Sparta. As for us agreeing to assist Sparta in fighting, that is just giving Sparta It's just a false name. In fact, there is no need to use a navy to fight Thebes. Even if Sparta wants us to send an army in the future, we can find a way to deal with it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sparta has become our ally now, but it will also be in the future. We have competing interests with Athens; Thebes once became an ally with us because of Sparta, but don't forget why it was an enemy of Athens for a long time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This time Thebes did not sign a contract in the end, and it will definitely As a result, the war between them and Sparta will continue, which is a good thing for us. Thebes' national power has now greatly increased, and Sparta will not defeat it so easily. The continuation of the war It will consume the strength of both parties. When the right time comes, we, Athens, will intervene to decide the final outcome and earn the maximum benefit!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Kallias was persuaded by him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the envoys returned to Athens, Callistratus received an urgent notice from the council: secret news came from Thebes, and they sent Pelopidas as envoy to Theonia in an attempt to Make an alliance!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus was startled.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even though he has been the king for many years, experienced a lot, and met many famous people, Davos still couldn't restrain his curiosity and looked at the person standing in the center of the palace hall. The Theban envoy, because this man is so legendary.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Sparta conquered Central Greece and Northern Greece successively, and almost all Greek city-states succumbed to the force of the Spartans, this young man, who was still unknown at the time, led a few like-minded friends and bravely Sneaking back to Thebes, he assassinated the puppets supported by the Spartans, and called on the people to drive away the Spartan army in Thebes; when many Greeks thought that Thebes's resistance was just a flash in the pan, with his Not only was the Theban government formed by the leader not destroyed by the continuous attacks of the Spartan army, but Thebes gradually grew stronger during the war, and in the end it was even able to compete with the Spartans.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pelopidas...Davos chanted this name in his heart. In his previous life, he didn't know much about the history of ancient Greece. He only remembered one Ipamirondas about Thebes. Now he thinks that the person in front of him is the same. He is also an amazing person.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pelopidas was also looking at King Theonia curiously. He thought that he had done a lot of great things so far, but compared to the one in front of him, he was nothing. He was far behind: When he had just come of age and was still keen on attending banquets, competing in competitions, and appreciating plays, this man had already led his mercenaries through thousands of dangers and returned from the hinterland of Persia, winning a great reputation; and then went to Magna Graecia, using less than a thousand men. The troops defeated the natives, occupied Thurii, created the Kingdom of Theonia, defeated Crotone, Syracuse, and Carthage. In just over 20 years, this kingdom became a real kingdom in the Western Mediterranean. The overlord!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He had been to Persia and witnessed the prosperity of Babylon. When he set foot on the land of Theonia, he observed carefully along the way, especially the grand scale of the city of Thurii and the prosperity of the port. He felt that it was not much worse than Persia. So he was surprised and excited, thinking he was in the right place.
