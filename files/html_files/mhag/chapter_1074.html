   Chapter 1074 Colossus of Hades
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Plessinas placed the first wooden board on the table, and Hernipolis immediately praised: "What a mighty Hades!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He saw a long black hair drawn on the wooden board. Hades, the bearded Hades, stood upright with his head held high, holding a sharp three-pronged fork in his right hand, and holding a scale for judging good and evil in his left hand. He was wearing a black cloak, with bright eyes and a solemn face. He was really majestic!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since this is not a painting after all, but a statue to be cast, Hades is also designed with a thick base under his feet so that he can stand firmly on the top of the mountain, and the upper left corner of the board is also marked with data: The statue together with the base is 14 meters high, with a maximum width of 2.5 meters. It is estimated that # tons of bronze will be needed (statues placed outside the temple naturally cannot be made of wood. After all, they are easily damaged by wind and rain over the years, so they are often made of Made of bronze with a certain softness)...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It is indeed a very good design!" Davos praised it heartily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This is Miliktus's design." Plessinas added.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos nodded. He knew that Miliktus was a famous sculptor in the kingdom and was now responsible for the casting of the statues in the main temple.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then Davos looked at a few more wooden boards. They were all good works, but they were all roughly the same in design.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos rubbed his eyes, feeling a little visual fatigue.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, he heard Plessinglas say: "Your Majesty, there is another design here. Our priests unanimously objected to letting it pass, but I think this work is very special, so I would like to ask you to take a look again."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Oh. ?What kind of design will cause you to disagree?!" Davos was curious.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Plessinas placed the board on the table, everyone's attention was attracted by it: Hades on the board was holding a double fork in his right hand, and holding a soul about to be punished in his left hand. , he was kowtowing to beg for mercy; Hades's left foot was behind him, his right foot was in front, his whole body was slightly stooped, and he lowered his head slightly, looking at the soul in his left hand, with a look of pity on his face; under his left foot was crawling The three-headed dog Cerberus, but the image is not ferocious. Instead, he stretches his head like a domestic dog and licks Hades' left hand...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It's no wonder that the priests don't like this design, because the designer made Hades look like He is more like a kind old man, thus lacking the majestic divinity.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Including Henepolis and Aristelas who were present were also surprised by the boldness of the designer.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Plessinas looked at Davos's expression carefully. After all, King Davos was a descendant of Hades. He was worried that such a bold design would anger the king and even anger him?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The atmosphere in the office was quiet and weird...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Davos asked softly and calmly: "Plessinas, why did you insist on keeping this design despite the objections of other priests?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty ...Because seeing this work makes me feel warm, I think if it is erected on the top of the mountain, believers will also feel warm when they see him... After listening to Davos's question, Plessinas felt in his heart With that in mind, he said truthfully: "I remember when you asked me to be the priest of Hades, you said, 'Hades is by no means cold and stern. It is precisely because he cares about human beings that he chose to be a priest of Hades. Hold on to Hell...'; You also warned us, 'As a priest of Hades, you must care passionately about believers, rather than being aloof, and take the initiative to help them solve their difficulties...' I think this design is in line with His Majesty's your requirements!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "well said!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos praised loudly: "You, the scepter priest of Hades, are well-deserved!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Thank you for the compliment, Your Majesty!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Plesinas responded calmly. When he was young, he had a radical personality and would use any means to achieve his goals. When he first became the priest of Hades, he did not do so voluntarily. However, he has devoted himself to studying the divine scriptures for so many years and has been influenced by it day and night. The body and mind gradually changed, becoming more and more humble, easy-going, and compassionate.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "If such a statue of Hades stood on the top of the mountain, everyone in the kingdom who saw him would deeply feel that there is such a thing. A benevolent god protects the kingdom and makes them feel warm and secure!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, he is also reminding us to always care about our people!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Davos pressed the wooden board and said solemnly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Your Majesty.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Plesinus and the two priests, Henepolis and Aristelas all looked solemn. Now they are sure that Davos has chosen this design.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Hey, what's wrong with the design of this statue? No base?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Henipolis suddenly discovered a problem: "This may have been overlooked by the creator. According to the data marked above, it is also 14 meters, and the body is leaning forward. If there is no base, it will easily collapse.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I specifically asked the creator about this, and he told me that this statue does not need a base and can stand very stable.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Plesinus pointed to the board and explained seriously: "He calls this three-point support. You see, the double fork and Hades' forward right foot serve as one fulcrum, and the backward left foot is another. Fulcrum..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Where is the other fulcrum?"
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Henipolis looked at the picture on the board with some confusion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It should be a three-headed dog. He raised his head and licked Hades' left arm. In fact, it was connected to the statue of the god, as another one on the left. The fulcrum, and the stooped posture of this statue lowers the center of gravity. With stable support, the statue is more stable. The designer's idea is very clever!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Davos praised.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "His Majesty saw the key to the problem at a glance, but I didn't quite understand it at the time. Fortunately, he prepared a small wooden sculpture that was exactly the same as the statue in advance and showed it to me. It was indeed very stable.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And your Majesty, look at this!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Plesinus pointed to the lower right corner of the board.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This is the direction... What does this number refer to?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Davos looked at it, a little confused.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, this is the latest writing method of the Pythagorean school of Tarantum to express the azimuth and angle. According to the designer, the statue of the god should be erected in front of the main god. On the cliff in the southwest direction of the temple, 68 meters away from the temple, the front of the statue is 30 degrees to the central axis of the main temple. In this way, after the statue is completed, it will overlook most of the city and be able to maximize reflection during the day. The sunlight allows ships entering and leaving the mouth of the Krati River to see the glint of the idol!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "When he said the last sentence, Plessinas was a little excited.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It seems that the designer is really very attentive and has considered all aspects of the problem!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos was moved in his heart and asked: "Listen to what you just said, he is from Tarantum?"
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A disciple of the Pythagoreans of Tarantum?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What is your name?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, this designer is called Alexon, a tribesman of the former Tarentum consul Archita, and a student of Lysis, the leader of the Pythagorean school. He is only 21 years old..." Plesinas detailed Making introductions.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A math student actually designed such an excellent sculpture!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This did not surprise everyone in the room, because many scholars in this era studied multiple fields of knowledge. Although mathematics and art may not seem to be related, the Pythagoreans used mathematics to discover sculpture and art very early. It is well known that the golden section of a painting creates their own unique aesthetic.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alixon... Archeta... Davos heard this long-lost name and was a little absent-minded for a moment. Then he thought of the rude young man his daughter kept talking about at home, and there was a stoic look on his face. A smile couldn't help but appear: "Although he is young, he can design such an excellent statue, which shows that he is very talented. He can be responsible for casting the statue, and you will be responsible for supervising and assisting him in completing it."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Your Majesty .
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !" Plessinas finally breathed a sigh of relief.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………………

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Turiyi inspectors quickly launched the arrest of Servius, Phryus, Aulus and others. As the public's attention was focused on Regarding the matter of "the Legion is going to the border to station defense", it did not cause any waves.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, officials from the Slave Management Office came to the Turiyi slave camp to reward Maximus, the perpetrator of this incident.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After knowing about it, the camp leader Aikarus made a request: "Can we wait until the task of providing stones for the main temple is over before announcing this matter, because Maximus is an excellent slave captain, and the slaves he led The team's quarrying efficiency is very high."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The official only said one sentence: "This is an order issued by His Majesty himself and requires immediate execution!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Aikarus did not dare to say any more.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On this morning, after the slaves had breakfast, they all gathered in the square. The officials of the Slave Management Office announced the order in public: Grant Brutus Maximus freedom.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Countless slaves cast envious glances at Maximus, but Maximus was hit by this sudden happiness and felt a little dazed for a moment, thinking one voice over and over again in his mind: Free!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I'm finally free!
  </font>

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   until someone's gaze pierced him like a sharp sword, causing him sudden pain.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Gaius, who had once been a very close compatriot, now looked upon him as if he were an enemy, for the order announced by the official stated very clearly: "…in view of the courage of Maximus in exposing the attempts of some Romans to destroy the kingdom. The conspiracy of order has maintained the stability of the kingdom... I hope everyone can learn from Maximus. As long as you sincerely safeguard the kingdom, the kingdom will not ignore your contribution!..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus, you traitor! Gaius roared angrily, rushing forward to beat Maximus severely.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus did not refute or resist, allowing Gaius to catch him, but Gaius' fist did not hit him because the slaves around him hugged him.
