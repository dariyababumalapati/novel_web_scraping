 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But Agesilaus has remained silent since he learned of this.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Some people proposed to change the envoy and send a relative whom Leoticides was familiar with; others who knew the situation at that time objected, believing that this would only be counterproductive.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two sides argued endlessly and could not reach a consensus, so they had to temporarily turn to another issue: the crime of Dolios for retreating without a fight and abandoning Messenia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Agesilaus spoke, and he supported Dolios, so that in the end Dolios was only deprived of the right to eat in public and reduced to a lower class.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the way home, Agesilaus had a different feeling in his heart when he saw the people greeting him again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When he returned home, he was alone in a room, pondered for a long time, and finally made a decision.

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In Messenia, soldiers of various Theonian legions, led by team officers and engineers, are busy every day: building the city of Messenia, building Simple docks, building important defensive camps...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The helots in this land were quickly organized by the village chiefs, and took turns to the military camp in Theonia. These Messenians headed by Tisias The citizens of Theonia registered them, officially declared them citizens of the new city-state in the name of the Holy Kingdom of Theonia and New Messenia, also allocated land to them, and also briefly told them about New Messenia. The political system and laws of Nia...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   these helots, who had been used as cattle and sheep by the Spartans since childhood, were confused and confused, but they knew one thing very well: they were free!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   They became the masters of this land!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After being in darkness all year round and suddenly seeing the light, the Helots were extremely grateful to the Theonians.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, Tisias and others reminded them that they would never want the happiness they had just obtained to be snatched away by the Spartans in the blink of an eye, so they all glowed with endless energy.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   They actively participated in the construction of Messenae and other facilities, and in addition to heavy labor, they also participated in military training organized by Theonian soldiers. At night, when they returned home, they were almost exhausted. They tried their best, but few people complained about being tired...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The high-spirited and selfless mental state of the Helots also infected the Theonian soldiers, so the entire Messenia was full of vitality.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Only Leoticides felt more and more depressed. Not only did he have to give detailed explanations to the various legion commanders, senior team officers, and even Sekerian who came to inquire one after another, but also in the past two days, he had to explain "he is The rumor of "Prince of Sparta" has spread throughout the Theonian army. Whether he is wandering in the camp or going out for inspection, he faces strange looks from the soldiers. He learned from his son that the soldiers were The most discussed sentence behind the scenes was "Since Lord Proseus is the prince of Sparta, will he lead us to fight the Spartans with all our strength and destroy them?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides knew in his heart: the entire army The reason why the army still remains in good order is due to the deterrence of military law and the impact of his impressive achievements in the past. However, if this continues, it will inevitably affect his control of the army and lead to a decline in combat effectiveness.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, in a short period of time, he could not express his determination to the soldiers. At this time, he was really helpless and regretted that he had been too generous before, so he simply stayed in the big tent behind closed doors.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Commander, a small boat is coming from the east, saying that it is a messenger sent by Sparta and asking to see you." Staff officer Muklu walked into the big tent and reported to him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Spartan envoy...Leotichides thought this was a good opportunity: "Bring him here! Inform several legion commanders and the captains of the three legions to come to the big tent to discuss matters! Uh, also There is a military judge!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing this, Muklu, who had been Leoticides' partner for many years, probably guessed what he wanted to do, and immediately replied: "Okay!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides was in command of several legions. The commander, according to the provisions of the "Theonian Military Law", his military tent must be spacious enough to hold military meetings, so a staff officer, a military judge, two corps commanders, plus twenty The four captains stood together in the military tent. There was still a passage in the middle, so it didn't seem too crowded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Report, bring the Spartan envoy!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Let him come in." Leoticides sat upright with a cold face.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The generals on both sides also stood up straight, but there was a hint of curiosity on their serious faces.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The curtain was opened, and a gray-haired old man walked in. Not only was he slightly stooped, he was very thin, but he also walked with a limp...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The generals were surprised: Sparta actually sent a disabled old man to take charge. Messenger, what does this mean?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Only Leoticides, who was sitting in the middle, suddenly opened his eyes and stared at the man who walked in.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Spartan envoy was holding a wooden staff and staring straight at Leoticides with his eyes. He staggered forward unconsciously. It was not until he was stopped by the guards that he suddenly came to his senses and said in a sad tone. : "Dolios did not admit his mistake, you are indeed my nephew Leoticides..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as he said this, the surrounding generals were shocked. According to the age and appearance of the envoy, some people quickly An incredible answer came to mind.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Are you... King of Sparta Agesilaus?!" Olivers couldn't help but asked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There was a commotion in the military tent. The people present were basically senior Theonian officers who came to Greece to fight against Sparta. According to past practice, they would naturally read the information in the military camp in advance to strengthen their understanding of Sparta. Understand, in order to know yourself and the enemy, and the most mentioned figure in Spartan information is Agesilaus. In his decades of military career, this Spartan king conquered Persia and other Greek city-states. It achieved impressive results and became famous in the Eastern Mediterranean.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, in the eyes of everyone, he was just a frail old man with no trace of the temperament of a Spartan warrior. No wonder some Greeks who were hostile to him called him "the King of Sparta who is least like a Spartan." ", but he dared to come alone, his courage is indeed admirable!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Muklu subconsciously looked at Leoticides, and saw the Theonia commander resting his right elbow on the table, his left hand pressing his thigh, leaning forward, his face gloomy and terrifying, and his eyes full of coldness.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Agesilaus's appearance had changed a lot at this time, Leoticides still recognized him at a glance. At that moment, a surge of anger rushed to his forehead, and he couldn't help but want to rush forward and kill him. The stabbing allowed him to calm down decades of resentment, but the cold temper he had developed over the years and his status at this time suppressed the impulse in his heart, allowing him to remain somewhat calm. He let out a breath, but wanted to see Seeing that this coward, who rarely goes into battle to kill enemies in person, took the risk and came here, what kind of tricks did he want to play?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus ignored the inquiries of the people next to him. He saw the man in front of him was gloomy and silent, and his expression gradually became a little sad: "I know you must have hated me very much these years, thinking that I took away your throne... ...After your father passed away, I really longed to become the king of Sparta...I am somewhat similar to you. We have been discriminated against by the people since we were young, so we are always eager to make some achievements to prove ourselves. You broke the royal family The tradition of participating in Agego's training, and because of my physical reasons -"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus patted his residual leg, and his words were a little more frank: "I can't be like a normal Spartan. Like a citizen, I win honor through fighting, so I am more eager to become a king and command the army to win... At that time, the situation of Sparta in Greece was not very good. I confidently thought that I was more capable than the young and energetic you. Bring Sparta out of trouble, so...hey!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus sighed from the bottom of his heart, his eyes becoming a little lonely: "But Sparta's situation today is even worse than it was then. It can be seen that I have I didn't do well, maybe I was really wrong, and I shouldn't have competed with you for this throne..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides stared at the sincere King of Sparta in front of him, with the aggressive image in his mind The image of self-confidence and arrogance has now become old and sluggish. He loosened his fists, clenched them again, and said in a cold tone: "You forced my mother to death."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus did not escape. His nephew's eyes were as hateful as blades, and he said calmly and sadly: "In order to become the king, I used some despicable methods, but I never expected that I would force your mother to death and force you away... these Whenever I think about this, I feel a little uncomfortable. Maybe Sparta will be reduced to what it is today because Zeus is punishing me for my sins!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus said, and his whole body slowly squatted down. He held the wooden stick firmly with his right hand, bent his healthy right leg, and dragged his left leg behind him, kneeling on the ground.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone was shocked: the majestic King of Sparta actually knelt down in public!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leotychides was also surprised, but his dull expression effectively concealed his emotions.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The next words of Agesilaus were even more surprising: "If killing me can eliminate the anger in your heart, I am willing to die by your sword! I only hope that my death will make you no longer resentful of life. You raise your Agidai family! No longer resent the Spartan people who have the blood of Hercules like you! Think of the towering Taygetos Mountain, the rushing Eurotas River, the ancient The Temple of Arthenis, the arduous Agego training... That beautiful land was created by the great gods. We Spartans received the guidance of the gods and lived there for hundreds of years, even if it will be destroyed one day , and it should not be carried out by you, a pure Spartan royal family, because when you get old one day and look back on the past, you may feel pain and regret like me-"
