   Chapter 1224: The Army Arrives at the City of Athens
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since there was not enough time to build a complete defensive camp, the Athenian army relied more on the condescending geographical advantage for defense, but whether it was the Lucanians, Samnites, or Gauls They are all fierce mountain races, and fighting in mountainous areas is their strength. What's more, now that they have Theonia's high-quality armor and weapons as a basis, they still have the upper hand. After a fierce battle for most of the day, they broke through the defense line.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In particular, the ferocious appearance of the Gauls wielding weapons and swords and slashing fiercely frightened the Athenian soldiers. They could not help but spread the word about the terror of the enemy while fleeing, which even frightened the people of Philili, a town not far from Mount Panissa. He took his family and fled with the defeated troops, allowing the army led by Lizaru to successfully occupy the town, then continued southward and soon surrounded another small town, Megalo Uno.

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The people of this town had no time to escape and had to put up a desperate resistance. Megalouno's resistance was not in vain. They bought some time for the Athenian soldiers and mercenaries defending in the south, especially Jason. These mercenaries have rich combat experience. Seeing the strength of the Theonian army, they have no hope at all in Athens' plan to defend the enemy from outside the country. They have long had the idea of ​​"retreating immediately at the first sign of trouble". This prevented Patroclus' plan of "containing the south and attacking from the north. Once the defense line was breached, the army quickly moved south to encircle the enemy forces on the southern line of defense." However, in the end, more than 1,000 escaping mercenaries were captured. .

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Iphicrates led more than 10,000 soldiers along the coastline when Athens' border defenses were completely defeated, and finally entered the city of Athens relatively smoothly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He ran into the Athens City Hall in a dusty state without washing his hands. The nine generals who were having urgent discussions in the room saw his arrival and immediately surrounded him like dew after a long drought. The first sentence they asked They were all: "Iphicrates, how many soldiers did you bring back?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "16,000 soldiers."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Why such a small number of soldiers?" Callistratus looked stunned. He thought: Even Thessaly After the army left, Iphicrates could bring back at least 30,000 to 40,000 troops, because as far as he knew, the Greek coalition army once reached 100,000 people at its peak (some city-states in Arcadia and Ellis were due to the distance The battlefield is very close, and a large number of citizens once participated in the battle as auxiliaries, but they did not actually have much combat effectiveness).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Iphicrates carefully gave a brief account of the battle in the Peloponnese.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After listening, everyone looked depressed, and some even couldn't help but said: "It's over...Athens is over..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The Eleans, the Arcadians, the Phocians, the Locrians... They are simply stupid! They should understand that at this time, there is no point in rushing home. Only by uniting and defeating the powerful enemy of Theonia can the safety of their city-state be guaranteed!" someone said angrily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Alas... when the danger really comes, these narrow-minded city-state citizens can only see the danger of their own mother-state. How can they share the same hatred and fight against powerful enemies! In the final analysis, the Greek Union is just a hastily established alliance. , It is destined not to last long!" Callistratus sighed helplessly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone was silent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Iphicrates had the opportunity to ask: "By the way, when I entered the city just now, I saw some broken soldiers shouting and yelling about defeat, defeat, which caused panic in the city. What happened?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus told Iphicrates with a heavy heart the news that "the Greek army was defending on the border and suffered a disastrous defeat."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After listening to this, the Greek veteran, who was always calm and wise on the battlefield, actually shouted angrily: "You clearly know that the incoming Theonian army is large in number and powerful, why do you want to destroy our few young people?" Citizens in their prime were sent out to die in the city! Who?! Who made this stupid suggestion?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ificrantes' eyes widened and he glared at everyone, some of whom lowered their heads unconsciously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Karalistratus took a step forward and said in a deep voice: "It is our joint decision, but it is also the demand of the people! When the remnants of Thessaly's army fled into Athens, we knew that the Theonian army in the north The attack will come soon, and Cabrias has made suggestions, 'Hurry up and inform the people in the Attica area to avoid the city, rely on the city walls to defend against the attack of the Theonian army, and wait for you to return with your army before counterattacking. ...'
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   We all agreed with this decision at the time, but..." A trace of shame flashed in Callistratus's eyes: "But in the subsequent citizens' meeting, most of the citizens did not agree and they refused without resistance. They abandoned their homes and allowed the Theonians to ravage and trample them... You know, during the Peloponnesian War, the entire Attica region, except for Athens, was almost destroyed into ruins by the Spartan coalition. Citizens don't want such a tragedy to happen again...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So we made a plan to set up a defense line on the western border to block the Theonian army for a period of time. After you lead the army back, we will find an opportunity to fight back... Who Knowing that the Theonian army came so fast and attacked so fiercely... Sigh..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Callistratus finished speaking, the other generals couldn't help but shake their heads and sigh.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Iphicrates looked at them with evasive eyes. He knew in his heart that what Callistratus said was not completely true, but it was meaningless to care about it at this moment. He took a few breaths to calm down his mood. Calm down, and then asked: "What about now? What are your plans now?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus said in a deep voice: "While the Theonian army is still far away from the city of Athens, we have sent people to inform In various villages and towns in Attica, let the people take refuge in the city immediately! We have decided to rely on the city walls to defend against Theonia's attack, and wait for you to return with your army before looking for opportunities to counterattack, but we didn't expect...the troops you brought back There will be so few..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing the unconcealable disappointment on Callistratus's face, Iphicrates said with an unprecedented solemn expression: "From what I have seen during the battle with the Theonian army, It seems that, as the rumors said, the Theonian army is very powerful and has a large number of soldiers. In addition to the Theonian army that has entered Attica, there are tens of thousands of people under the city of Corinth. The Theonian army. According to my judgment, Corinth may fall soon, and when the two armies join together... we alone cannot defeat such a powerful Theonian army, unless Persia sends an army to support it. ..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Don't have any expectations for Persia!" A general shouted angrily: "The Persians deceived us, they will not give us any support at all, and the Persian envoy ran away!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Iphicrates He was startled and quickly looked at Callistratus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The chief general nodded painfully: "The King of Persia has already led his army to attack Egypt, and he has no time to take care of us... We were fooled..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Iphicrates slumped down on the wooden chair. He had served as a commander in the last war launched by Persia against Egypt. He knew very well that Persia would use all its strength to launch a war against Egypt, and it would not be short-term. It can be over in just a few months.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Agurrios of Old Hermician said loudly: "During the Peloponnesian War, the citizens of Athens relied on the defense of the city wall and held on for decades without being broken by the Spartan coalition. Today we have It can definitely be done! The Theonian army is indeed huge, but because of its huge size, they will consume a lot of supplies. Can the Theonians sustain such a huge consumption for a long time?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   His words made some people With his spirit lifted, Cabrias, who had been in charge of the navy, finally couldn't help but remind him: "The reason why we were not afraid of the siege by the Spartan coalition back then was because we controlled the sea, and the supplies that the people urgently needed could pass through at any time. Merchant ships came in, but the Spartan army had nothing to do about it. But now it is different. Theonia not only has a strong army, but also a strong navy. During this time, their fleet patrols near Salon Bay every day, intercepting merchant ships coming in and out. It has had a great impact on our maritime trade!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Our warships have taken risks many times, and both sides have suffered casualties. However, we have too few warships, and we cannot build new ships without being able to obtain ship wood from the outside world (A There are very few forests in the Tika area), and it will only become less and less. When the Theonian fleet completely blocks our port, where will we get enough food to meet the needs of the entire Athenian people!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agullios was momentary At a loss for words, he happened to see someone hurried in. He quickly asked with a straight face: "What's the matter?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "General Agurrios, generals, the Theonian army has landed in Aegina, and I ask you to send troops to rescue quickly. !"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What?! Aegina was attacked!" The generals were shocked, and Cabrias asked anxiously: "When did this happen?!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   According to Aegina The person who came to report said... about... about two hours ago, the Theonian fleet suddenly blocked the port of Aegina, and tens of thousands of Theonian soldiers landed on the beach at the southwest corner of Aegina Island. , and launched an attack on the city of Aegina... The garrison on the island has never seen our reinforcements, and the situation is very critical. They had to send warships stationed at the port to rush out of the port at risk, and finally broke through Dio. The blockade of the Nian fleet came to report..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Where are our patrol warships? Why didn't they find out and report in time?!" Callistratus asked angrily.
  </font>
 </font>
