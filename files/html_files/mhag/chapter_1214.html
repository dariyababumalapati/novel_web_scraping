   Chapter 1214 Tragedy in the world

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   , but Polydorus didn't know it. After the order was issued, Polyfulon, who was in the front team, turned pale. He violently pulled a handful of mane off the horse under his crotch, and he neighed in pain. Not only...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Late at night, the Thessalian army returned to the camp outside the city of Philae, and the exhausted soldiers soon fell asleep.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Troubled by the tension at hand, Polydorus tossed and turned, unable to sleep.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Suddenly, he heard several loud noises outside the door. He subconsciously sat up and shouted: "Philox (the guard on duty at the door), what happened outside?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   No one responded, but Then he heard the sound of "dong dong dong" footsteps, and a tall figure suddenly appeared in front of him, but it was Polyfuron. He had a ferocious face and held a dagger with a cold light in his hand.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Polydorus was startled, and immediately shouted loudly: "Third brother, what are you—"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Polyfulron's eyes widened, and he swung his dagger quickly and forcefully, hitting Polydorus in the face. A bloody gash was cut on his body. The blood and severe pain caused his screams to stop abruptly, and he fell on his back on the bed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Without hesitation, Polyfulon stabbed his brother's chest with his dagger continuously, and blood splashed all over his face. It was not until Polydorus stopped struggling that he stood up and stared at him as he fell in a pool of blood. Brother, whispered viciously: "Coward, you should have died a long time ago! Next, I will let Jason know that only I can save Thessaly!"

   ……………………………… ……………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At dusk that day, Oropus's messenger arrived in Athens on horseback.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Executive Council of the Athenian Generals soon held an emergency meeting in this regard.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Everyone, I just received news from the Orops." Callistratus said with a serious expression: "Their crew found that a large number of Theonian warships and troop transports entered Mariakos Bay and Pagasa Bay, and stay for a long time..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The other eight generals were shocked when they heard the news, and some couldn't help but exclaimed: "The Theonians are going to land in Thessaly!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Some people also said worriedly: "Not only landing in Thessaly, if the Theonians successfully landed in the Gulf of Mariakos, they can completely capture Heraclea and Thermopylae, and then continue south to attack Foshan." The city-state of Keith..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Since the beginning of the war, we in Athens have been prepared for the possible landing of the Theonians. Thessaly should also be prepared. The Theonian army may not be able to successfully land. "A general said uncertainly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The key depends on how many troops the Theonians sent?" Cabrias asked: "Did the Orops say how many Theonian troop transport ships there are?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I asked." Listratus replied: "They cannot tell a specific number, but one thing they are sure of is that the number of Theonian warships and troop transports they saw must have exceeded a thousand." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A thousand ships ..." Cabrias estimated: "If Theonia's entire fleet is calculated as 1,000 ships, even if the troop transport ships account for half, there will be approximately 25,000 soldiers. And we all know it. , a mixed formation of warships and transport fleets, the number of warships often accounts for only 1/4 of the entire fleet, or even less. Excluding some ships transporting supplies, I estimate that the Theonian army that landed will have at least 30,000 people..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "30,000 people!..." The other Athenian generals looked at each other, and one of them said with luck: "It is reported that there are more than 30,000 people defending the Peloponnese against the attack of our Greek coalition. The Theonian army, could it be that they transported the main Theonian force defended in Messenia and Sparta to the north?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Probably not!" Cablias said with certainty: "If the Theonian army The Onians removed their army in the Peloponnese, so the remaining soldiers will definitely not be enough to withstand the attack of the Greek coalition. Once Messenia and Sparta are recaptured by us, it will be equivalent to cutting off their army. The retreat of the army that just landed in the north, I don't think the Theonia people will make such a big mistake!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Besides, 100,000 troops were dispatched when Theonia and Carthage fought a few years ago. The Theonia landing army is probably the new army just dispatched from their country..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The news that Theonia dispatched 100,000 soldiers to fight Carthage is just a rumor, and it cannot be confirmed to be true. Who knows? It's not that Theonia deliberately exaggerated the facts to scare surrounding forces." The general still stubbornly retorted: "Even if that is the truth, it is just because they were fighting locally at the time, and now they are carried from Theonia Tens of thousands of soldiers landed in Thessaly, which is hundreds of miles away. How much consumption and cost was involved? You should be very clear when you have led the navy in these years. I don't think Theonia has the strength to re-enter from their territory. Mobilize troops internally!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Kabulias said seriously: "During the Peloponnesian War, we Athens could send 40,000 troops to the expedition to Syracuse. The territory controlled by the Kingdom of Theonia now is comparable to that of that time. We are much larger, and of course they are more able to do it."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The general sneered: "The territory of the Kingdom of Theonia is indeed much larger than ours in Athens, but most of it is barbaric and barren land, how can it be compared to Athens was wealthy at that time, and we controlled the entire Aegean Sea trade at that time! -"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Everyone, stop arguing!" Callistratus persuaded with a serious look: "No matter who landed in Thessaly, The current question is whether the Theonian army was drawn from the Peloponnese or brought back from the territory of the Theonian Kingdom. The defense in Thessaly should be very empty. I am afraid it will be difficult to resist such a large number. Huge army, what should we do about it?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Immediately send people to inform the city-states of Phokis and Locris of the news that the Theonians have landed in Thessaly, so that they can strengthen the defense of the city and send people to find out the presence of the Theonians in Thessaly as soon as possible." What's going on in Salisbury.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Cabrias said calmly: "At the same time, we should immediately send people to the Peloponnese to tell Jason the news. He will definitely lead his army back to Thessaly as soon as possible and defeat the Theonian army. To eliminate the hidden dangers in the north, we should also send troops for reinforcements when necessary.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Cabrias, I can only agree to half of your proposal.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "A slow voice came from the corner. The speaker was a gray-haired old man. He had been closing his eyes to rest, but his opening immediately attracted everyone's attention.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   His name is Agullios, an Athenian nobleman and one of the former leaders of the democrats. He has been elected as the general of Athens many times. Together with Thrasibulos, he worked together to help Athens gradually get over the shadow of its defeat with Sparta. He began to regain his former strength, and he pursued the principle of "city-state interests first", which directly contributed to the creation of the theater subsidy system, so he was very loved by the people of Athens.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But in recent years, he no longer participated in the election of the generals of Athens. He was too old for one reason. More importantly, he was the father of Callistratus. He wanted to make way for his son who had already become famous and had greater ambitions. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Two months ago, a democratic general was seriously ill and unable to serve on the council, so he recommended him to replace him. The citizens' assembly finally passed this somewhat ridiculous resolution. The possible reason was that Callalistratus successfully signed the agreement with Sparta. The contract, which squeezed out Thebes, was a great benefit for Athens and won him great prestige.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, in the face of major changes in the Greek mainland situation such as the invasion of the Theonian army, the decline of Sparta, the rise of Thebes, and Thessaly's ambitions, Agu, who had experienced the Peloponnesian War and the Corinthian War, The fact that Elrios sits on the General Executive Committee is probably more reassuring to the Greek people, so there is an anecdote about a father and son serving as generals in Athens at the same time. This has never happened since Athens adopted a democratic system.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Currently, the Greek coalition is aggressively attacking Messenia and Sparta occupied by the Theonians. They are at an absolute advantage. It may take a few or more days to break through the Theonian defenses. , completely drive them out of the Peloponnese... If we tell Tagus at this time that Thessaly was attacked by the Theonian army, he will definitely lead the army back to Thessaly immediately, It will be at least two or three months before it is possible to rejoin the Greek coalition..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agullios glanced at everyone with a deep look, and finally fell on his son: "It is even possible that he will not lead the main force south again, so that Prevent Thessaly from being attacked again! According to Iphicrates' report, the Thessaly army not only accounts for half of the Greek coalition, but also has strong combat effectiveness. It is the main force of the coalition's attack on the Theonian army. Once Sessaly If the Sally army leaves, the combat effectiveness of the coalition will be greatly weakened, and it will also shake the confidence of other Greek city-state armies. By then, not only will the Greek coalition no longer have the advantage, but they may also suffer defeat!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus was moved in his heart. , said with some hesitation: "Father, you mean... we will not tell Jason the news for the time being. But in this way, Thessaly will be in danger. Once Theonia takes over Thessaly, Not only can they threaten Central Greece from the north, they may even threaten our subsidiary state of Amphipolis in the north of Macedonia... In the long run, we will lose more than we gain!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agullios did not respond immediately. Looking forward with cloudy eyes, with some memories, he said unhurriedly: "You all know that I was once the leader of the Battle of Amphipolis (a key battle in the Peloponnesian War, Athens The survivors of the defeat in the battle, which resulted in the cutoff of their food transport channel from the Euker Star Sea to Athens), but you don't know that before that battle, I stayed in Thessaly for a period of time, and I had a certain understanding of Thessaly. Understand...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The land there is flat and vast, the population is large, the city-states are constantly fighting with each other, and the surrounding mountains are filled with fierce and aggressive natives. There are constant wars with the Thessalians... I am actually very impressed that Jason was able to finally unify them. Surprised. A unified Thessaly is the main force resisting Theonia, but it is also a threat to Athens. I think Jason has fully demonstrated his ambition before!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I don't think that Theonia, as a foreign alien ,
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Asia can completely conquer Thessaly and its surrounding areas with just these 30,000 soldiers. It is more likely that they will arouse the anger of the xenophobic Thessalians, just like the previous Spartan invasion of Boiosia, which completely fell into the quagmire of war. And a Thessaly that fell back into chaos is no longer a threat to our Athens..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Note: According to historical records, after Jason was assassinated, his brother Polydorus took over as Tagus He died suddenly on the way to Larissa with Polyfulon, and Polyfulon succeeded Thessaly Tagus.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because Polydorus died suddenly without any warning, many people at the time believed that Polyphoron killed Polydorus while he was sleeping at night.
