   Chapter 1157 The Prince Goes to War
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax was attracted by this story, and he asked curiously: "Since that scoundrel was not good at leading troops in battle, why did he win in the end?" "The

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   main reason for his victory was There are two." Davos looked at his son, slowed down his speaking speed, but emphasized his tone: "First, he is good at employing people. He allows outstanding talents who are good at handling administrative affairs to manage the territories he captures and provide sufficient resources. Logistics support and soldiers, let those who are good at commanding operations serve as generals, lead the army in battle, and let people who are good at strategy make suggestions for him... Those who take refuge in him can all use their talents and make full use of their talents;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   secondly, he is good at absorbing his subordinates He has correct opinions and is good at correcting mistakes, so he can always grasp the entire battle situation more accurately and formulate correct strategies... This is the reason why he can finally win."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After listening to these words, Clotokatax fell into deep thought .
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   among.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos said softly and thoughtfully on the side: "As a king, you don't need to master the ability to command troops, but you need to master the ability to command generals, give them tasks suitable for their talents, and let them charge into battle for you. Your The main focus should be on analyzing and grasping the trend of the entire war. To this end, I will appoint Printols as your staff officer and Kalliaas as your army diplomat, ready to provide you with advice...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dio Nigeria was founded by force, and its citizens took pride in military exploits. If you are completely blank in the military, you will lack prestige among the people in the future. Moreover, the Ministry of Military Affairs is the most important department of the kingdom, and it only belongs to the jurisdiction of the king. If you want to make those military exploits The illustrious generals are completely obedient, and you must also make a difference in the military. When you were just an adult, you spent some time in the staff office, so you should have some understanding of the military affairs of the kingdom. You also worked in Rome to prepare for the expedition to Gaul. The army has prepared military supplies and supplies. If you add this time to lead the troops in battle, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the entire military operation of the kingdom. No one will be able to fool you in this regard in the future..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos's persuasive approach made Ke Lotokatax was moved, and he said in a deep voice: "Father, I am willing to go to Messenia!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Okay! Okay!" Davos nodded happily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "But -" Crotokatax hesitated for a moment, and then said with a serious expression: "The citizens of the kingdom cannot farm and do business with peace of mind. They spend more time on military training and only think about fighting. In order to make meritorious service, if things go on like this... I'm afraid it will not be good for the stability of the kingdom."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos restrained his smile and looked at him seriously: "I'm very happy that you can see this! The reason why Theonia rewards conquest is, That's because since the founding of the kingdom, we have been surrounded by powerful enemies. We have to do this in order to survive. It is definitely not possible to carry out this way for a long time, but we must also defeat the powerful enemies that threaten us and ensure the kingdom. After we are safe."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crotokatax felt relieved. Originally, he was worried that his father would not listen to his opinion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos sighed lightly and said to him solemnly: "But you have to understand that the system of rewarding battles has been implemented for so many years and has become deeply ingrained among the people. It cannot be changed all at once. It must go through us for several years. Generations of efforts have transformed it bit by bit.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, you must also understand that even if we defeat all the powerful enemies in the Mediterranean, we cannot completely put down our guns and shields. This will make the people of the kingdom gradually become addicted to Being comfortable, becoming cowardly, and fearing war will eventually be wiped out by a newly rising force like Carthage! So how to control the balance between the two is good for me, you, and our future generations. Descendants are a headache, but a very important issue!"

 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Late at night, Crotokatax returned to his mansion on the mountainside and took a bath. After taking a shower, go into the bedroom.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dido was sitting on the edge of the bed, holding the child and humming Gayao softly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing her husband come in, Dido asked the female slave standing next to her to carefully carry the sleeping child to the outhouse to sleep peacefully. Then she asked in a low voice: "You are back. What did your father ask you to talk about?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " Lotokatax did not answer immediately. He looked around and asked in a low voice: "Why didn't you see Chris?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You were left on the mountain by your mother again." Dido said coldly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hearing the anger in his wife's words, Clotokatax quickly comforted him: "Mother loves Chris. She will definitely take good care of him. He is close anyway, so you don't have to worry." "How dare
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I worry? , your mother is a princess who is deeply respected by the people of Theonia, and even her father has to listen to her."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dido sneered to express his dissatisfaction, Clotokatax remained silent, he was used to it, he knew It is best not to speak at this time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sure enough, Dido just vented for a moment, and then asked: "Father asked you to go, what did he say?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Father wanted me to be the commander-in-chief of the expedition to the Peloponnese." Clotokatax was truthful said.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If it were an ordinary woman, her first thought would be the safety of her husband, but Dido's thoughts were different from ordinary people. She immediately asked in surprise: "Isn't the commander of that army Proseus? He has already led the army to capture After conquering Messenia and making great military exploits, how could it be possible for you to take over? Could it be that my father is planning to send another army?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "General Proseus is the prince of Sparta..." Clotokatax Briefly describe the situation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "So that's it." Dido's pretty face showed a happy look: "I'm relieved now! You've been idle for so many days since I came back, and I was a little worried. Now it seems that my father has been prepared." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I But it's my first time to lead an army on an expedition, why don't you worry about my safety, in case..." Clotokatax said half-jokingly and half-seriously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Father dares to let you go, so he must have made thorough preparations. How could you be in danger? Dido bowed slightly, her chest half-covered by her pajamas revealing a piece of white snow. She smiled, and the bedroom glowed: " Your Highness, I wish you will return victorious and become a hero of the kingdom!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Klotokatax swallowed: "Then do you want to give me some rewards in advance?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "As he said that, he pushed his wife down on the bed...

   ………………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the early morning, Mount Amendolara was shrouded in mist, and the houses on the mountain were indistinct and could not be seen. So real.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The open space in front of the Temple of Zeus on the top of the mountain (many years ago someone proposed to convert the Temple of Zeus into the temple of Hades, the protector of the kingdom), but it was opposed by the elderly. They believed that it was precisely because of the protection of the Temple of Zeus. , many Amendolara people survived the invasion of the Lucanians. Due to their persistence, this temple has now become the only Zeus temple in Greater Greece, and people from other towns often come to worship. ), hundreds of young men in military uniforms stood in neat lines.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Standing in front of the team was an old man with white beard and hair. Although his face looked old, his figure looked relatively strong. He was Ctissus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, he said with a majestic look: "Alsinis, are everyone here?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Not yet... there is still one missing." The young man at the head said hesitantly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Who is missing?!" Ctissus shouted with full energy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Well...that...Tepandes."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Alsinis, although you are only temporarily serving as the captain of the company for military training." Ctisus reprimanded dissatisfied: "But since you have become the captain, You should strictly perform your duties instead of trying to protect your friends. You must know that military law is merciless. The reason why the Theonian Legion is invincible is because we have strict discipline. Do you understand?! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I understand, military training officer!" The young people responded in unison.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Immediately form a column and march 50 times around the square!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A circle around the square of the Temple of Zeus is about 150 meters, and 50 circles is 7,500 meters. Moreover, the young people are all wearing armor and holding wooden sticks and shields. (Because it was just training, I didn't use a real gun shield.) This amount of exercise is quite large.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But no one raised any objections among the young people, and they immediately took action.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, a young man hurried into the square: "Report!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Tepandes, you came quite early!" Ctissus glared at him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hearing this, Tepandes trembled subconsciously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Alsinis, according to military law, if you are late for training, what should be the punishment?" Ctissus asked coldly.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This time Alsinis did not hesitate: "You should be punished with ten sticks!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Tepandes, did you hear that?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tepandes suddenly panicked and actively wanted to defend: "Uncle Ctissus , I am because-"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "There are only soldiers and instructors on the training ground, get down!" Ctisus strode over and kicked Tepandes unceremoniously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tepandes didn't dare to dodge, and after receiving a hard kick, he lay down obediently on the still wet ground.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It seems that Tepandes is very well-behaved, but in fact he has an unusual background. He is the second son of the legion commander Trotilas. Of course, almost all of these young men are from noble families, including Matonis, Olivers, Geogris, A. Garcia... many of the sons of the kingdom's generals and ministers were among them. Alsinis, who was temporarily designated as the company captain, was the adopted son of the legion commander Melisander.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After all, Amendolara is the birthplace of the Sacred Kingdom of Theonia, and the situation is special.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, many retired soldiers of the legion shied away from serving as the military training officer of Amendolara, but Ctissus was different. He was a former Persian mercenary and was a comrade with the fathers of these young people. Before retiring, he served as the first officer all year round. The first captain of the legion, with enough prestige, dared to train these young people in strict accordance with military laws. The young people who were punished did not even dare to go home and complain, because not only would it have no effect, but they would also get a beating from their father.
