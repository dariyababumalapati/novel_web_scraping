   Chapter 1264 The incident happened suddenly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Kristoya couldn't help but asked with concern: "What's the matter?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "There is an important administrative matter that needs to be dealt with urgently. I'll go and I'll be back soon. Here I leave it to you and Agnes to let the children eat happily."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Whether it is the two princesses, Clotokatax, or Eunice, they are all very used to Davos leaving midway. , the banquet was still held lively.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos walked straight to the front yard, where Aristelas was already waiting in the study.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What happened?" Although Davos' tone was calm, he knew in his heart that it was by no means a trivial matter for the intelligence chief to come here when the people of Turiyi were celebrating the victory of the Theonian Games.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, I have just received information from Africa -" Aristelas said solemnly: "The fleet of the Egyptian envoys was on its way to Thurii. The sea between Lumentum encountered a storm and may have been destroyed-"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Maybe it has been destroyed?" Davos raised his eyebrows, obviously dissatisfied with such an ambiguous statement.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Aristelas hurriedly explained: "The storm occurred at dusk, and there were no other ships nearby to witness it. It was not until the next day that a Phoenician merchant ship rescued the Egyptian sailors who had been drifting at sea for most of the day. After learning about this situation, they immediately reported it to Hadrumentum. Just when the intelligence personnel of Hadrumentum issued this report, the entire African region had sent a large number of ships to search the entire sea area. The Numibian Light Cavalry Corps has also been dispatched to search along the coast. I believe that more detailed reports will come soon." "There
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   are unforeseen circumstances! No wonder the Egyptian delegation has not been able to arrive in Thurii in time. Port..." Davos tapped the wooden chair with his fingers, pondered for a while, and sighed helplessly: "May Hades protect Jie Hao and be safe and sound!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Aristelas stood quietly with his hands tied.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos glanced at him and asked with a smile: "Are Azuna and the children going to the arena to watch the opening ceremony of the sports meeting today? Did they think it was good to watch?" "It's
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   very exciting!" Aristelas said nothing. He replied hesitantly: "Boris (his youngest son) kept talking excitedly when he got home. Azuna decided to take them to watch the game tomorrow." "There
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   will be games in several arenas tomorrow. How to make a choice is a headache." Davos said seriously: "If you can't buy tickets, you can go to Ribazo and he will prepare it for you." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty!" Aristela Si said gratefully.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Okay, I won't keep you any longer. Today is a happy day for all the people of Turii. Go back and celebrate with the children!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos looked at Aristelas with a smile. He excused himself and left, then sat alone in the study, staring at the hazy night through the wooden window with his deep eyes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For a long time, he said thoughtfully and softly in Chinese: "The heaven and the earth work together to bring good luck..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He walked to the door of the study and asked Ribazo to call Crotokatax.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Clotokatax came to the study, Davos told him about the storm that the Egyptian envoys encountered.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax was shocked: "This is terrible! If Jie Hao dies in a storm, Egypt will be in chaos!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Why do you say that?" Davos asked calmly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Father, you want to test me again." Clotokatax smiled bitterly, but continued: "The political situation in Egypt is complicated now. Pharaoh Tanib is ill in bed and cannot govern. Jie Hao is basically in charge of the national affairs. . After Jiehao took office, he quickly changed Egypt's long-standing national policy and began to suppress and suppress domestic religious forces. This has aroused the dissatisfaction of a large number of monks, and Nectanipos, a relative of Pharaoh Tanib, also He was dissatisfied with Jie Hao's rule and had ambitions for the throne of Egypt. There were also rumors of collusion with the Egyptians...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was precisely because Jie Hao's rule in Egypt was unstable that he was willing to take risks and personally lead the delegation. Come to Thurii to participate in our sports meeting to gain our full support for him... But if Jiehao is killed in the storm, Pharaoh Tanib is seriously ill and unable to govern, and there is no second prestigious heir to the throne to stabilize the political situation. , whether it is monks or Nectanipos, it is very likely that they will take the opportunity to cause chaos..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos nodded and asked: "So, how do you think this matter should be handled?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatak Si thought seriously for a while and then said: "I think we should first send more manpower to speed up the search for Jie Jiehao's traces and determine his life and death as soon as possible. If Hades protects him and he is still alive, then everyone will be happy, and we should hurry up He was brought to Thurii and arranged for doctors to treat him to ensure his health.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, he sent a messenger to Memphis to inform Pharaoh Tanib and Egyptian officials of the news that "Jie Hao was safe and sound" to avoid some rumors that would cause Egypt to Turmoil. After the Games, an elite army was sent to carefully escort Jie Hao back to Egypt, to show the Egyptian people our Theonia support for Jie Hao and to help him stabilize the political situation in Egypt.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But if Jie Hao is killed..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Gram Lautoka Tax paused for a while, and then said solemnly: "Not only must we return Jie Hao's body to Egypt as soon as possible, but we must also send envoys to discuss with Pharaoh Tanib and let him designate a successor as soon as possible, and Establish contact with the successor, re-establish the friendship and alliance between the two countries, and promise to fully support its rule in Egypt.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, we will begin to mobilize some legions and fleets. Once there is a rebellion in Egypt, after receiving Egypt's request for help, we will Immediately send troops to Egypt to help quell the chaos..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos listened carefully and said in a gentle tone: "You are very thoughtful. This is indeed the most standard way to deal with this crisis."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Krotoka Tuckers was stunned and asked in confusion: "Father, what do you mean?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos stared at him and said in a low tone: "Theonia was still very weak back then, facing Syracuse. , Carthage's huge pressure, Egypt formed an alliance with us, it can be said that it gave us a lot of help, especially in terms of food.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But times changed... As the kingdom grew more powerful, Egypt became more and more of a liability.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the war five years ago, we devoted all our efforts to conquer the Greek mainland, and had to allocate part of our strength to help defend Egypt. In the following years, we sent many troops to garrison in Egypt.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos tapped the armrest of the seat with his fingers, his eyes getting deeper and deeper: "With the Greek mainland being included in the kingdom's sphere of influence, Egypt has become the forefront of the kingdom's struggle with Persia, and the Persian king seems to be interested in re-entering the kingdom. He is very persistent in conquering Egypt... But the situation in Egypt is becoming more and more unstable. Even if Jie Hao is still alive and has our support, judging from his previous governance style and methods, the conflict between him and the Egyptian monks will only It is getting more and more intensified, and Egypt's political situation in the future may continue to be turbulent, coupled with the foreign enemy Persia... Do we, Theonia, have to send reinforcements again and again to help him maintain domestic rule?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Don't forget, Theonia and Egypt are just brothers, not parents who only want to give without asking for anything in return.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hearing this, Crotokatax's heart skipped a beat, and he immediately persuaded him: "Father, hasn't the administrative meeting already made a decision to launch an attack on Persia?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   We need strong support from Egypt, and after we defeat Persia, Egypt will naturally stabilize.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even if the conflict between the future pharaoh and the monks intensifies, it will be an easy problem for us to solve by then, so I don't think it is a good idea to dissolve the alliance with Egypt. This is not in line with the kingdom's consistent tradition!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos smiled slightly: "If Jie Hao is still alive, the kingdom will naturally support him.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But if he has been killed and Tanib is about to die soon, according to the information currently obtained, Nictanipos is very powerful and is likely to succeed in usurping the throne. Will Theonia and Egypt still be allies by then?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Nectanipos, supported by Persia, can only be our enemy!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Father, as long as we send reinforcements in time, we can stop the Nectanipos rebellion.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Klotokatax reminded: "Even if Nectanibos takes the lead and succeeds in usurping the throne, we are still capable of completely defeating him and supporting other descendants of Tanibos as pharaohs.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   did not comment, but said quietly: "Ten birds in the forest are not as good as one in the hand... Allies are allies after all, and there are many and troublesome things. It is not as convenient as using your own!"
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Klotokas' eyes suddenly widened, and after a moment he asked in surprise: "Father, are you planning to...conquer Egypt?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos looked at him and said in a deep voice: "Owning Egypt is of very important strategic significance to the future development of the kingdom!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the past few years when you have been handling state affairs in Turiyi, you must have a deep understanding of the kingdom's food production and supply. Although there have been no droughts in the past few years and the harvested food is relatively sufficient, the population of Turiyi and its neighboring areas With the rapid growth, the food produced by the local people is completely unable to be self-sufficient. It must be imported in large quantities from Sicily, Rome, Africa and other regions, and the amount is increasing year by year. However, the food output in these areas is almost constant. If this continues, there will always be Consumption will exceed supply in one day...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Po River area is crisscrossed by water networks and densely forested. It will take a long time to fully develop it.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And Egypt has been the granary of the Mediterranean since ancient times. If you own it, you will have long-term food security!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Besides, once we defeat Persia and occupy some territories on the Asiatic coast of the Eastern Mediterranean, having Egypt nearby to provide them with protection will also make the kingdom's rule there more stable.
  </font>
