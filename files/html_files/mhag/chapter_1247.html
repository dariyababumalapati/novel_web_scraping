   Chapter 1247 Strategy against Persia (1)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This is a good suggestion." Davos nodded in approval: "Tapirus, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs must send envoys as soon as possible to the tribes of Gaul in the mountains adjacent to the Liguria region. Conduct friendly negotiations. As for the Ministry of Intelligence... they have already launched operations in the Gaul region beyond the mountains."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Okay, Your Majesty." Foreign Minister Tapirus immediately stood up and responded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Is there anything else?" Davos then asked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty!" Clotokatax coughed slightly and said: "Yesterday the preparatory team received a clear reply from Egypt. This time they will send an envoy team of nearly a hundred people for the Games, led by Pharaoh Tanib. His son Jie Hao."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Is it Jie Hao who has been designated by Tanib as the next pharaoh?" Davos was slightly surprised.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, we have repeatedly confirmed that this Egyptian delegation is led by Egypt's Vizier Jehao." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty, the Egyptian Pharaoh actually sent his heir to Thurii to watch the games. This will undoubtedly show the world The strength of the kingdom also reflects the strong friendship between Theonia and Egypt!" Tapirus said excitedly: "I suggest that the Egyptian mission should be greeted with grand etiquette in response to our emphasis on Egypt!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This is what it should be. Your Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible for the arrangements." Davos did not show any joy. On the contrary, he asked solemnly: "According to the information from the Intelligence Department, Tanib has been ill and bedridden for three months. In August, I wrote a letter offering to "send the best doctors to Egypt to treat him," but he politely refused. Although I don't know the details of his current condition, his state affairs are completely represented by Jie Hao, which shows that his condition is very serious. Serious! Under such circumstances, Jie Hao actually came to Turiyi in person, just for friendship?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The ministers fell into deep thought.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Aristiras, the intelligence chief who was sitting at the back of the queue, stood up and said in a low voice: "Your Majesty, the Intelligence Department has found out that Jiehao's cousin Netaneb has obtained many Egyptian generals and monks. With the support of Jie Hao, he repeatedly raised objections to Jie Hao's sole control of the country, and even claimed that he was the most suitable successor to the Pharaoh. This posed a great threat to Jie Hao's succession to the Pharaoh's position, and we also discovered that this Nektaneb It seems to have contacts with Persia."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Initially, the head of the Intelligence Department was not allowed to attend the kingdom's administrative meetings, but the information obtained by the Intelligence Department was often the focus of discussion at the meetings, requiring Aristelas to explain in detail. He had to be invited to be present at short notice, and eventually the auxiliary ministers changed the rules, making Aristelas a frequent guest at the executive meetings of the kingdom's ministers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The news he told immediately caused a heated discussion among the ministers in the hall.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, Jie Hao led the Egyptian mission to Thurii at this critical time. It is obvious that he has felt the threat of Netaneb and had to come to the kingdom in person to seek support." Assistant Minister Sipulos said loudly : "We should not hesitate to express our support to him to strengthen his confidence! Now the kingdom and Persia are mortal enemies, and Egypt, which is adjacent to Persia, is the most important tool for the kingdom to contain Persia and even attack Persia in the future. We must not lose our allies!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as Sipulos finished speaking, Antaoris stood up: "But it is not enough for us to support Egypt verbally. Tanib was only ill for a long time and did not die. As the Pharaoh's The heir, and also the agent of the state, Jie Hao actually came all the way to Thurii to seek help, which shows that neither Tanib nor Jie Hao can rely on their own strength to eliminate the threat of Nektanib
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   . Netaneb, who is supported by Persia, should have the ability to launch a rebellion and eventually seize the throne of Egypt! Therefore, we must take action, like we did 5 years ago, send troops to Egypt to consolidate Jie Hao's rule!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Egypt is just Theonian Asia's alliance is not a subsidiary. If you want to send troops, Jie Hao must first take the initiative, otherwise the allies will become enemies." Sipulos reminded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "According to diplomatic practice, this should be done." Antaoris then said: "But we have to consider that Jie Hao is just a young man under 30 years old. It is reported that he resolutely changed Pharaoh Tanib during his acting period. The law of preferential treatment for monks has been adhered to in Egypt for many years... Young people are often overconfident and cannot see the situation clearly. What if he cannot invite us to send reinforcements in time? We must be prepared for this in advance!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since Lucy After As and Hermon retired, Sedorum was also in a state of being inactive because of his old age. The title of chief assistant minister apparently fell on Sipulos and Antaoris, so in ministerial administration You can often see scenes like this in meetings. Of course, Antaoris usually takes the initiative.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Olivers stood up and said loudly: "Your Majesty, since Persia put down the rebellion in Asia Minor at the beginning of last year, the Persian army has quickly withdrawn to the east of Mesopotamia. At that time, we all thought that due to the Persians' three-year The Persian king had given up his plan to conquer Egypt after many years of constant battles, so the country's strength was greatly depleted.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But now it seems that the greedy Persians have not given up, but have just changed their strategy. They will successfully quell the rebellion in Asia Minor. The method was used on the Egyptians. They wanted to trigger civil strife in Egypt by buying off Egyptian generals, thereby making it easier to conquer Egypt. This must arouse our vigilance!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This Persian king is cunning and cunning, and he must retaliate. His Majesty refused back then. When the Persian envoy asked for peace for Carthage, he began to hate us Theonia and instigated the Greek city-states to oppose us..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Olivers became more and more angry as he spoke: "In the past four years, not only have we Providing material assistance to the rebels in Asia Minor, and also allowing the Greek allies to actively accept employment from the governors of various regions in Asia Minor and send citizens to participate in the battle, Artaxerxes has long regarded it as the number one mortal enemy. I am afraid that this time Persia not only took action against Egypt, but There are also other conspiracies against the kingdom. We can no longer respond passively, but should take the initiative and send a large army to attack Persia while Persia's national strength has not recovered!" As soon as these words came out, many
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ministers were surprised: The original meeting The focus was on discussing the holding of the sports games. Why did they suddenly talk about launching a war against Persia?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sedorum coughed a few times and said in a hoarse voice: "I remember... we discussed this issue last year, and it was rejected outright by everyone... Why did you bring up this issue again today?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lord Sedorum." Olivers bowed slightly to show respect, but his tone remained firm: "The reason why this proposal was rejected last year was because we did not expect that the rebels in Asia Minor would suddenly be defeated, and the Persians The people were able to quickly pacify the western region, which had been experiencing violence for several years. In addition, the kingdom had to hold a sports meeting, so it was not approved.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But through more than a year of investigation, we have figured out that the reason why the Asia Minor rebels quickly collapsed was because Artaxerxes bribed and won over some rebel generals and Asia Minor nobles, and they assassinated Arioba. Zenis and other rebel leaders allowed the Persians to win.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the Persians did not establish effective rule in Asia Minor for more than a year after quelling the rebellion. The political situation there is still relatively chaotic, which will reduce the resistance to our attack on Persia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Theonian Games will be held next month. Not only will it no longer involve most of the kingdom's energy, but it will also inspire people's confidence because of its successful hosting.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, after five years of rest, the kingdom has sufficient food, supplies, and troops, and has completely controlled the Greek Alliance. Thessaly has also been integrated into the kingdom, allowing our sphere of influence to cross the Aegean Sea eastward and reach the coast of Asia Minor... ...We have such a huge strategic advantage, so we should seize this great opportunity and launch an attack on Persia!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Persia is not Carthage or Greece. It is a kingdom with a vast territory and a large population. Even if its national power has declined due to war, compared with it, our Theonia is still like a wolf facing a sick cow.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   , it is not an easy task to defeat such a kingdom!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Has the Ministry of Military Affairs prepared a detailed attack plan for this?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Asistes' question is more like inviting the Minister of Military Affairs to give further explanation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Of course!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Chief of Staff Printors took the opportunity to stand up and explained: "Your Majesty!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   My Lords!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the proposal to 'attack Persia' was rejected last year, our Ministry of Military Affairs has been further exploring how to defeat Persia. Through intelligence collection and multiple simulated battlefield exercises, the Ministry of Military Affairs finally formulated an attack plan. Its general strategy is - "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors cleared his throat to make his pronunciation clearer: "Taking full advantage of the chaotic situation in Asia Minor, send an army of about 50,000 people to attack western Asia Minor. This army may not all be supported by us. It is composed of citizens of Onia, and the kingdom is the leader of the Greek Union. We can completely mobilize the Greek allies to form a coalition with the slogan of "Revenge against Persia" to launch an attack on western Asia Minor.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Greece, especially the Ionian island city-states, are very close to Asia Minor, which will make our food transportation more convenient.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, it will also help us gain support from the Greek city-states along the coast of Asia Minor more quickly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the process of fighting against the rebels in Asia Minor in the past few years, the Persian king had sent people to promise to the coastal Greek city-states in Asia Minor that he was "willing to give them more autonomy." Therefore, these city-states basically remained neutral and did not provide support to the rebels.
