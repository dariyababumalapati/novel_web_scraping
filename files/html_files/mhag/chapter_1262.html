   Chapter 1262 A Different Race (2)

 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because there are dozens of athletes left in the arena at this time, and they are all athletes who are about to participate in the 100-meter race. Although the sports meeting preparation team also prepared lunch for them, most of the athletes Not consumed right away, but acclimated and warmed up on the track.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the side near the royal stand, the staff of the sports meeting inserted wooden poles at both ends of the measured track, then tied them to the wooden poles with long thin ropes, stretched them on the ground, and then the referees Holding an iron spoon with a long pole, he traced straight white lines hundreds of meters long on the solid dirt along the thin rope...

   "I was surprised before that there was neither a starting stone nor a starting stone in this arena. How to run a race with a stone pillar at the end? Now I know that the white lines drawn with white powder are the starting line, the finish line and the runways. This is very clear!" "But, I

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   counted them, and they used The white line only outlines 6 runways. Are only 6 athletes allowed to compete at a time? I remember that in other sports games, there were more than a dozen stone pillars at the end, and more than a dozen athletes competed at the same time~..."

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's nothing. , just play a few more rounds! The key is that there are fewer players in one game, which can avoid confusion and facilitate referee supervision. It seems that the Theonians have carefully considered the shortcomings of other sports games and really want to make this time a success. Let's have a good sports day."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The man who spoke was Harpius, a middle-aged citizen from the city-state of Okomenus in the Arcadian Union. He had participated in many running competitions in various sports games when he was young. Later, due to his age, I am unable to participate in the competition, but I am keen to watch the competition.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   His biggest regret is that he failed to win the championship. Once he was very close to the championship, but a nearby player hit him in the face while swinging his arm, which affected his final result. He also appealed to the referee, but to no avail. Therefore, he deeply detested some of the shortcomings of the Greek Games.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Harpius is a senior sports fan. After learning that Theonia, the overlord of the Greek world, was going to hold a sports meeting, he rushed to watch it without hesitation and was lucky enough to buy tickets for the opening ceremony.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before entering the arena, he was prepared to criticize the Theonian Games with a critical attitude, but after the opening ceremony, his favorable impression of the Theonian Games greatly increased: the unprecedented novelty of the opening ceremony was also the second , the most important thing is that he felt the real respect of the Theonia Games for the participating athletes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a person who has experienced it, he is deeply aware of the hardships of being an athlete. In addition to the unremitting and hard training, he also has to rush to the stadium alone before the start of the sports meeting, arrange food and accommodation at his own expense, sign up at the temple in time, and accept the priest. Detailed inquiries, tedious preparations before the start of the game, no one to relieve tension and annoyance, all glory after the game goes to the champion, and no one greets other losers even if they are injured...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But this time in the Theonia Games But it is obviously different. He has talked with the athletes of the Arcadia League before: Theonia not only provides free and comfortable accommodation and food to all participating athletes, but also requires participating city-states to send officials to deal with all the chores of the athletes. , which means that athletes can devote themselves to the competition without worrying about other problems.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the opening ceremony, the Theonians arranged for the athletes to go around the stadium to accept the salute and cheers of so many spectators...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Harpius regretted that he had been born a few years earlier and did not enjoy such an honor.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, Harpius, who has a good impression of the Theonian Games, certainly hopes that the Theonian Games will also be brilliant after entering the competition stage. With his experienced competitive vision, he carefully observed the layout of the stadium and soon discovered that There are some clues that are different from previous sports games.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I heard before that the Theonian Games will not only hold a 100-meter race, but also 200 meters, 400 meters, and 800 meters... After I entered the venue, I found that there were no stone pillars as markers in the venue. I wonder how they will compete in long-distance races (in Greek games, when competing in long-distance races, athletes run from the starting stone slab to the end stone pillar, then run around the stone pillar and back again, and so on until they have completed the distance, similar to (for the current return run), now I understand.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Look! The Theonians built the entire arena into a large circle with small stone bricks, and then drew lime powder outside the entire circle as they do now. On the track, the contestants run in a large circle, not to mention a few hundred meters, but several thousand meters can be easily held. This is much simpler than running around a stone pillar!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Harpius said about the long distance in previous sports games. The way he ran the race was very touching. With his decades of experience in sports games, his words were both organized and contagious. Naturally, he attracted a group of spectators, led by him, who were having a serious discussion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, someone shouted: "Look up there! Oh my God, the Theonians are going to cover the sky!" The
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Gentile spectators raised their heads one after another, and then all opened their mouths, showing surprise: only the Lord could be seen. Above the arena, long strips of white cloth are slowly converging towards the center of the arena, forming a thin white cloth cover that covers the sky above the arena, blocking the direct sunlight at noon. , bringing shade to the audience.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xenophon, who came to the Deolia Arena for the first time, was as surprised as the other foreign spectators, and couldn't help but ask: "How is this done?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos replied calmly: "Actually, This is very simple. There are 200 wooden poles erected on the edge of the top of the arena. Each wooden pole is connected to the wooden pole on the opposite side of the center of the arena by a pulley string. When the sun is exposed and there are competitions, the competition will The management staff of the venue will tie special cloth strips on the strings of each wooden pole, and then turn the pulley to push the cloth strips upward to the center of the sky... However, just when we are enjoying all this with peace of mind, don't We forgot that there are hundreds of managers at the top of the arena who are serving us under the scorching sun..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although it sounds very simple, the design is very clever!" Plato on the side sighed sincerely: "The key is that this kind of encounter Difficulties are not about being willing to endure them, but about trying your best to solve them, and the spirit of striving to do your best is very rare! We Greeks are relatively careless and not very particular about life, but the Theonians are different. They have different requirements for life. It is very high, so that their spirit of inquiry of striving to do their best has penetrated into all aspects of the entire kingdom... So I am full of confidence in Theonia hosting the games. Not only will it be successful, but it will definitely make all Greeks interested in You will gain a new understanding of sports!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Hahaha..." Davos said with a hearty smile: "What a Plato, you can tell a great truth about every little thing!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xenophon did not speak, he looked at Up in the sky, thoughtful.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just as the foreign spectators marveled at the ingenious design of the main arena, the athletes began to withdraw from the arena, which caused some spectators to wonder: "Is the footrace not going to be held?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And some experienced spectators like Harpius asked
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He said firmly: "No, the race is about to start!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just as they said, the athletes came to the lounge next to the entrance of the arena. Since the Theonia game is held every year, the room dedicated to the players was decorated very comfortably, but the athletes were not interested. Feeling this, they took off their previous attire for the entrance ceremony, put on the shorts specially provided by Theonia, and then began to carefully apply olive oil evenly on their bodies. After all this was done, everyone They all began to pray devoutly to Apollo to soothe their nervousness.

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   after awhile.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A priest walked in and said loudly: "Dear players, the time for the competition is up, please come in!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Silitaos, who had already calmed down, heard this, and his heart suddenly started beating faster again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dozens of athletes returned to the field again, and the priest gathered them together. Since this was the first game of the Theonian Games, in order to ensure that it could proceed smoothly, Chalcides, as the head of the referee team, personally served as The host, the always amiable old priest, looked serious at this moment. He said in a strong tone: "Dear contestants, I think you should have a very good understanding of the rules of the Theonian Games after practicing for a period of time. But I still have to emphasize it again before the competition - only the players whose names are called can participate in the competition, and the other players must stay away from the track and must not interfere with the competition; players can start after the referee issues the command of 'race start'; before starting, Feet cannot cross the starting line; after starting, runners cannot deviate from their own track, cannot interfere with other runners, and cannot intentionally obstruct or injure...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Anyone who violates any of the above regulations will be disqualified from the competition! If you violate it intentionally, If the circumstances are extremely serious, the referee team will report the player's situation to the Games Preparatory Team, who will decide whether to carve the player's face on the punishment wall of the upcoming Theonia Games Memorial Hall as a punishment for future participation in the Games. The warnings from the Onia Games athletes! - Did you all hear it clearly?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's clear!" The athletes nodded in response one after another.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, Chalcedis showed a smile, raised his palms to the sky, and said gently: "May Hades bless you!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then, a priest took the athlete roster and said loudly: "Please pay attention, my name is The contestant whose name has been called will participate in the first round of the competition - Siriteos! Runway No. 1!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Siriteos was stunned: he was called the first one, this is such good luck!
