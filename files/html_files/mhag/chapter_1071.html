 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lysias took over the conversation and replied: "It's just a bit far away and requires a boat, but the twin cities of Naxos and Crimesa have provided rich governance experience for this."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mentotic Els said "Oh" and had no doubts.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos continued: "Except for Messina, the original Sicilian territory, plus the eastern mountainous area of ​​Leontyni and Sikel (during the Western Mediterranean War, the tribe gathering place of Sikel was destroyed by the Carthaginians). Destroyed, food was looted, and some tribes betrayed Theonia... After the war, Theonia won a great victory. Some tribes were afraid of being liquidated, and some tribes faced the Theonia army in order to survive. Under the goodwill mediation of threats and diplomacy, they successively chose to surrender to the kingdom, causing a domino effect that lasted for a year. Finally, the entire West Kel Mountains was completely integrated into the Kingdom of Theonia) and merged into the East and West Sili regions, governed by Ka. Tanay;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Taunis, Syracuse and their original sub-states, Camanlina, Pacinos, and the entire southeastern corner of the Western Mediterranean were merged into the Syracuse region, with Syracuse as its seat of government;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then there are Germe, Minoa, Agrigento, Ecomus, Gela, and the central mountainous area of ​​​​Sikere from Enna to Kefaroition, merged into the South Sicily region, governed by Located in Agrigento;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The rest of the towns in Sicily and the Sican area (after the war, the Sican people who suffered heavy casualties feared the revenge of the Sikels and voluntarily surrendered to the Kingdom of Theonia) were merged into the western region of Sicily, with the seat of Lilibei;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Taking Salos as the dividing line, the northern half of Sardinia is divided into the northern part of Sardinia, and its jurisdiction is in Salos;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The southern region of Sardinia is governed in Calaris;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   All the areas formerly controlled by Carthage in Corsica became the Corsica region, with Alenia as its seat;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The southern part of Iberia that Carthage assigned to us became the southern part of Iberia of the Kingdom, with its seat in Sisi;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There are nineteen regions in total. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone listened carefully to Davos's story and pondered these new administrative divisions. It was obvious that King Davos had carefully considered the divisions after repeated thinking and for the convenience of management, development of trade and other aspects: Some areas are large, but the population per unit area is not too large, such as Lucania and southern Sicily; some areas are small, but densely populated, such as Crotone; some areas are small , the population is small, but it is very important to the kingdom. For example, Corsica is rich in precious metal reserves, especially tin... But even so, everyone still has some doubts.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, you seem to have forgotten Hadrumentum in Africa?” the attentive Antaolis reminded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I have not forgotten that although Hadrumentum is not large in area, its location is very important. It is adjacent to Carthage and the Eastern Numibians. It is temporarily under the direct jurisdiction of the kingdom so that we can timely and accurately Get the situation there and respond in time." Davos' answer made everyone feel reasonable, so no one raised any objections.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, the area of ​​southern Iberia is too large. The area is the sum of many of our other regions. It seems inappropriate to only turn it into one region." The steady Lysias was a little worried.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos explained helplessly: "Although the Carthaginians conquered southern Iberia, it was just a conquest. It was still far from completely making it their own. Except for the people in coastal towns, they were basically the same as before. Except for the Carthaginians and Phoenicians, the interior areas were almost self-governed by the tribes of Southern Iberia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After we took over, very few people from the kingdom colonized there, and the officials sent there were still familiar with the situation there. Except that the mines were changed to be run by businessmen from the kingdom, the political structure there did not change much. Now that the entire kingdom has a lot of spare land and insufficient population, it is impossible to immigrate to it in large numbers in the short term to change its population composition. It is better to maintain the status quo for the time being to ensure the stability of the region... At least from the current perspective , Haka, the governor of the region, is still very active in cooperating with the kingdom's requirements and acting in strict accordance with Theonia's decrees..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Sir Haka is indeed very knowledgeable, but it is against the laws of Theonia to rule in one area for a long time, and I heard that his physical condition is not very good..." When Sedorum said this, He cast a consulting look at Medical Minister Helps.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Helps responded truthfully: "According to the medical records sent back by the doctor we sent to treat him, he has had a bad heart since he was a child. It cannot be cured and he should not be too tired!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "So it is best to transfer him back to Thurii to take up an important position, and at the same time, he can better treat diseases... At the same time, letting our officials take over Iberia earlier will also help it integrate into the kingdom faster." Dorum then made another suggestion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos fell into thought.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lysias, Cedorum and other ministers exchanged glances with each other, but none of them spoke.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After all, the identity of Iberian Governor Haka is too special. He is not only the patriarch of the Carthage Magonid family who surrendered to Theonia (half a year after the end of the Western Mediterranean War, Mago, who had been in a coma, finally died Although it stands to reason that the patriarch of the Magonid family should be succeeded by Hasdrubal, most of the family members hope that Haka, who has a gentle personality and is more respected by King Davos, will be the successor and is more important to the family. It was advantageous, and Hasdrubal himself was not willing to take on this important task, so despite Haka's repeated shirks, he finally took the position, but he humbly stated repeatedly that "he was just acting as the patriarch for his brother." This position"), and because he has been in charge of government affairs in southern Iberia for a long time, he is relatively prestigious both among the original officials and the local indigenous people, not to mention that he is also a relative of King Davos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Also considering these issues, Davos considered it carefully and answered more cautiously: "This matter... I have to ask Haka himself for his opinion first. If he agrees to come to Turiyi, what do you think about Bagu?" Can Le successfully take over southern Iberia?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the beginning, after the southern region of Iberia was merged into the Kingdom of Theonia, in order to stabilize the situation there, Davos promised not to replace the officials there in the short term, but he sent a group of Theonia officials with strong administrative capabilities to go there. In the towns of southern Iberia, they served as deputies to the original officials, and their leader was Bagule.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Letting an important minister of the kingdom serve as the administrative adjutant of the newly surrendered area seems to be a downgrade, but Davos took into account that Bagule has served as the chief executive of large towns in the kingdom such as Grumentum, Cosenza, and Udia. The Chief Executive not only has outstanding political achievements and rich experience, but is also particularly good at handling local indigenous affairs. Therefore, he is the most suitable candidate. Therefore, he specially invited the Bagule family to attend the royal family banquet and had a heart-to-heart discussion with Bagule. After the conversation, Bagule happily accepted the appointment and went to southern Iberia to take up the post.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, judging from the fact that Bagule made a special trip to the Senate last year to conduct a government affairs report, he has not only become familiar with the government affairs situation in southern Iberia, but also made local officials familiar with him, and some officials are also willing to cooperate with him. , and he has also made friends with many Iberian indigenous tribe leaders in the territory and won their trust. I think the problem is not big, but he should still seek his own opinion first." Hermon said first He praised Bagule a lot, and then expressed his opinions cautiously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos pointed the location of Iberia on the map with a wooden stick. After a moment, he asked aloud: "If Haka chooses to come to Thurii, what position would be more appropriate to appoint him?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone looked at each other, not knowing how to answer.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As mentioned before, Haka's status is too special. He is already a senator of the kingdom (although he rarely participates in Senate meetings), a governor (regional chief executive, although it was only a post-war compromise), and a member of the kingdom. Important ministers, even the rotating chairman of the Senate and ministers of various departments are only at the same level as his current position. Moreover, the important positions in each department are currently occupied and there is no vacancy. As for temporarily leaving them idle, I am afraid that it will also take a considerable risk. There is a big risk, because this will cause misunderstandings among the original people and officials in southern Iberia, and they will feel that the kingdom is about to start killing donkeys, which may cause turmoil in southern Iberia...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While everyone was silent, some people also complained about Cedorum, feeling that he should not have done so much, making it difficult for everyone to get off the ground.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos's profound gaze swept across everyone's faces one by one, and then said slowly: "When I see it, it is better to set up an additional rotating chairman and let Haka take over. What do you think?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone was stunned.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sedorum, who had sensed everyone's resentment, responded first: "I support His Majesty's decision. Now that the number of senators has increased, the five rotating presidents are not enough to represent all the senators, especially the number of senators from Phoenicia has exceeded 10. Sir Haka's role as rotating chairman is exactly what the kingdom needs!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Where did these more than 10 Phoenician senators come from? More than half of them did not come from western Sicily or southern Iberia, but from Sardinia. Although some Phoenician city-states on Sardinia chose to surrender during the Western Mediterranean War, Theonia did not allow it. Like their compatriots in Sicily, they can choose autonomy. In the past, Carthage could completely control the entire island of Sardinia for its own benefit, so of course Theonia can also force all these city-states to be merged into the Kingdom of Theonia. The people of Sardinia, who had been ruled by the Carthaginians for a long time, did not have strong political demands. As soon as Theonia became tough, they complied. However, in order to appease the local people and facilitate governance, the kingdom still selected some people with knowledge on the island. Famous people enter the Senate.
