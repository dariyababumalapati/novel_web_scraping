   Chapter 1139: Declaration of War on Sparta (2)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thedorum continued: "I heard that many Greek city-states sympathized with the destruction of Messenia and took the initiative to take in many people who fled Sparta. Messenians, if our army can enter the Peloponnese under the banner of 'helping the Messenians regain their independence', I think the Greek people will not be so disgusted with us, let alone once If we really rebuild Messenia and free the Helots, it will not only seriously weaken the power of Sparta, but also make the rebuilt Messenia completely turn to us and become the most supportive in Greece. One of our forces."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos nodded slightly. It was obvious that Cedorum's proposal was very satisfactory to him. He immediately turned to Alexis and asked: "What is the opinion of the Ministry of Military Affairs on this?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alexis He replied with almost no hesitation: "Your Majesty, from a military point of view, choosing to attack Messenia is a good strategic choice. If our army lands in Central Greece or the north of Peloponnese through the Gulf of Corinth, it will be with It is indeed safer for Theban armies to fight together, but it also means that most of the results we obtain may be obtained by the Thebans, and it will also arouse the vigilance of nearby neutral city-states, such as Athens and Corinth. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But if you open a separate battlefield, most of the Peloponnese Peninsula is covered with mountains and ridges, making it inconvenient for large armies to land and march. Messenia is undoubtedly the best target. Its southern coast is flat and suitable for The army landed very close to Sparta, but separated by mountains that were difficult to pass through. Reinforcements from Sparta could not arrive quickly, giving the landing army enough time to completely occupy Messenia. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Moreover, the next attack from the land route only needs to pass through the Arcadian territory to directly attack Sparta, while the attack from the sea route is even closer. The flat southern coast of Sparta is also conducive to landing, thus avoiding This eliminates the possibility of direct conflict with other powerful states in Greece..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Alexis is a military officer, he will also seriously consider political factors when making military plans. This is what Davos appreciates most. : "Very good! The Ministry of Military Affairs will formulate a plan to attack Messenia as soon as possible."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Your Majesty." Alexis responded immediately.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty." Printors raised the battle report in his hand and said: "I noticed that the battle report mentioned that there were many Thessalian cavalry in the Boeotian coalition. According to the latest intelligence from Greece, northern Greece The Thessaly region has been basically unified by Jason, the tyrant of Philae. If these cavalry are not hired by the Thebans, they can only be sent by Jason, which means that Thessaly may quietly I am afraid that this alliance with Thebes will attract our attention!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Thessaly..." Davos rubbed his chin, lost in thought.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Matonis said with a smile: "Thessaly has also formed an alliance with Thebes. This is a good thing. It allows us to not worry too much about the Thebans' crazy revenge from Sparta before attacking Greece." Facing a crisis again, we can also consider forming an alliance with the Thessalians at the appropriate time."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Matonis showed a good impression of the Thessalians, which was not what some ministers expected, because after so many years of working together, they all Knowing that Matonis is from Thessaly, Olivers is from Thessaly, and Hieros is from Thessaly... Now some of the former mercenary generals in the Theonian army are from Thessaly, and even their king Dave Sis was also from Thessaly, so everyone wisely did not argue with Matonis's words.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But what they didn't know was that Davos had no feelings for Thessaly at all. Instead, it was Printors' words that aroused his vigilance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thessaly is located in northern Greece. It is a barbarian land in the eyes of traditional powerful states such as Athens, Corinth, and Sparta. There have been constant conflicts in Thessaly, and it has never had any impact on the political situation in mainland Greece.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After twenty years of development, the Theonia intelligence department has been growing in funds and manpower, but more and more areas need to be investigated and monitored. Therefore, no energy has been invested in such a remote area, and only relying on The Theonian merchant ships that occasionally go to Philae for trade get some information.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even if Jason, the tyrant of Philae, conquered several neighboring city-states in the past few years, it did not attract the attention of the intelligence agencies. After all, there were so many tyrants in the Mediterranean city-states, and it was not uncommon for some to do something, but they were usually short-lived.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It wasn't until the news that "Philae quickly united Thessaly and Jason to become Tagus" reached Thurii that Aristiras paid attention to it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although in the years that followed, Jason ceased any warfare and seemed content to simply be Tagus of Thessaly.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But this aroused Davos's vigilance, because Jason spent the past few years mainly integrating the city-states of Thessaly, promoting trade within the region, stepping up training of citizen soldiers, and even forming a navy... … Jason's actions are somewhat similar to those of Dionysius, the tyrant of Syracuse, and due to Thessaly's geographical environment, its infantry and cavalry are stronger.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Could it be that the tyrant of Thessaly finally couldn't stand his loneliness and wanted to interfere in the affairs of Southern Greece?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ... Davos was wary and immediately said: "The tyrant of Thessaly Philae is very ambitious. If he really secretly formed an alliance with Thebes this time, he may want to use this war to To seize the hegemony of Greece, we must not sit idly by! Ansitanos, you send an envoy to ask the Thebans if they have also formed an alliance with Thessaly to understand the situation clearly. It is best to find out Thebes The true attitude of the people towards Thessaly will determine the measures we will take in future conflicts with Thessaly."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Your Majesty." Ansitanos responded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "How...how could this happen?..." Matonis looked stunned.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors, who knew a little about the situation, came to his side and told him in a low voice.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos didn't pay much attention and continued: "Persia will never let go after the Spartan army is defeated. Now the Thessalians may also be involved. Since we have decided to interfere in Greek affairs, we must take advantage of the Spartan army." During the period when the Badans suffered a defeat and other forces have not yet fully intervened, we must implement our plan as soon as possible!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alexis, Printors, you two make a judgment now. We will seize Messenia and How many troops will be needed to attack Sparta later?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alexis and Printors looked at each other, and then called the military training commander Hieronymus, the quartermaster Artorns, and the legion commander Matonis. , Olivers and other generals gathered in a circle in the corner of the hall.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After some quiet discussions, Alexis walked up to Davos and said solemnly: "Your Majesty, based on what the Ministry of Military Affairs now knows about the situation in Sparta and the geographical conditions of the Peloponnese, After discussion, we believe that only 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers are needed to complete the expedition. With too many troops, it will not be easy to launch in the mountainous Peloponnese Peninsula." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   20,000 to 30,000 soldiers... ..." Davos turned back and asked: "How long can the existing domestic grain reserves support their operations?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Minister of Agriculture Burcos stretched out his hands and calculated carefully before standing up and saying: "Your Majesty, the country has continued to have good harvests in recent years. Although there are some battles in Iberia and the Po River Plain, they are basically local battles. , not much food is consumed. According to this year's survey statistics, the granary storage in various regions is basically full, which should... be able to guarantee an army of 30,000 people to fight in mainland Greece for more than one year." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   More than one year. ...Um...where are the weapons and equipment?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Military Quartermaster Alpuins immediately stood up and replied: "Your Majesty, the armories of military camps in various regions have sufficient arrows, javelins, tents, blankets, pack cars, and other military supplies. It is more than enough to supply 30,000 soldiers."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing this, Davos showed a somewhat satisfied smile. He thought for a while, glanced at Assistant Minister Hermon, and said: "Considering that this is our first time in Theonia, To send troops to fight in mainland Greece, in order to reduce the resentment of the neutral city-state people against us, it is best to send soldiers with Greek descent as much as possible... The
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   last time we fought in Gaul, the first, second, third, ninth, and third The six legions, 10 and 11, so this time... Well, considering that we have to fight the Spartans, in order to be more secure, let's let the first, fourth and sixth legions go out."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " Got it, Your Majesty." Alexis asked again: "What about the cavalry?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Cavalry and auxiliary troops don't need to consider whether they have Greek ancestry. Don't the armies of Greek city-states often hire foreigners to fight, such as Thrace, so you can make your own decision."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos looked at Laphias, the Minister of Household Registration, and asked: "Are the Theonian citizens of Messenian descent still concentrated in the court? Darius (the city-state had already responded to the strong demands of the citizens and merged into the Kingdom of Theonia
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   a few years ago)?" Laphias, who has been silently in charge of the kingdom's citizen registration for decades, population distribution map of the kingdom and migration changes are always firmly engraved in his mind, and he can answer immediately without any need to recall: "Your Majesty, that's it... nearly half of the population still remains in Tyndares, and the other half of the population Went to Himera (after the Western Mediterranean War, in order to strengthen its rule over the north coast of Sicily, the Kingdom of Oria rebuilt the city of Himera in the middle of the north coast. The terrain there is relatively flat and there are large rivers passing through it, which is suitable for Grazing and planting, thus attracting many residents of other towns on the north coast)."
