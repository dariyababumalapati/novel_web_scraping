  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, our army is fighting a war with Sparta in the Peloponnese. It consumes a huge amount of military rations and materials, and they are mainly shipped from the port of Thurii. If we want to With the successful completion of the task, officials from various departments in the Turiyi region will naturally have to deal with more affairs. Now... the Kingdom's Administration Office and the Ministry of Military Affairs have notified each region, requiring all legions to assemble, which requires the preparation of more military supplies. Prepare more transport ships and prepare for the upcoming war.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, the officials of Turiyi have to deal with more heavy tasks. As the administrator of Turiyi District, how can I order my subordinates if I do not lead by example? The officials are working diligently and conscientiously."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It seems that you have some resentment! Do you know where we will attack first in the upcoming war?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty, I have been away from the army for many years - "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's Thessaly!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Thessaly?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "We have left Thessaly for more than 30 years. I'm afraid you have forgotten what your hometown is like... When we left Thessaly at that time , the city-states of Thessaly are still fighting against each other, but now Thessaly has a Tagus. This Jason is not weak. He has asked Thessaly to join the Greek Alliance, and is gathering an army to prepare. Going south to fight with our army may be a big trouble for our army." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So, Your Majesty, are you planning to take advantage of Jason's army to go south to have the army raid the territory of Thessaly by ship?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " He also said that you have been out of the army for many years and are unfamiliar with the military, but your intuition on the battlefield is still very keen!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Such a long-distance and large-scale landing operation is not easy!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It is not easy, but it will happen. It is beyond the enemy's expectations, and we have the advantage at sea. As long as the army is carefully prepared and trained, they can definitely do it!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty, after the army landed in the territory of Thessaly and conquered those city-states, in the future, Dispose of the entire Thessaly?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You also know that the Greek city-states are capricious. Even if we win the war this time and finally force them to surrender, there may be Greek city-states who will stand up against us in a few years, and eventually they will Form an anti-Theonian alliance... Therefore Thessaly is very important to us! To the north is Macedonia and to the south are the Greek states. As long as we have it completely in our hands, we can completely suppress Greece in the south. With the expansion of city-state power, you can punish them at any time, or you can go north to conquer Macedonia, a kingdom that seems ignorant, backward and chaotic, but actually has a vast territory and huge potential..." "You mean
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ... let the city-states of Thessaly Become a subsidiary of the kingdom?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "No! I don't intend to turn Thessaly into a second Carthage, nor do I intend to turn them into a second Tarantum! I want to completely turn Thessaly into a Part of the kingdom's territory, let our former compatriots become citizens of the kingdom! This is why I called you here today. I want to appoint you as the administrator of Thessaly region, and I want to ask for your opinion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, Thessaly can Whether Thessaly has been successfully captured is still uncertain, and even if Thessaly is captured in the future, integrating Thessaly into the kingdom will still be an arduous task, not to mention that you are now the administrator of the central area of ​​the kingdom, and you are suddenly transferred to a place far away. To serve in a kingdom or an area where everything is uncertain... Sigh, it is indeed too difficult for you!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It doesn't matter if you disagree, I can choose someone else—"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, I am willing to go to Thessaly!"

   Hilos did not regret accepting the appointment of King Davos so readily. On the contrary, he was excited by the news that "the landing army successfully passed the valley pass". Now he is just worried about whether the army can go further and be more powerful. Successfully captured Larissa, after all, it was his hometown.

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just when the soldiers of the Second Legion landed on the coast of Peleus, The large fleet led by Patroclus also arrived at the northern end of Euboea, and then each ship quickly furled its sails and began to sail west.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There are many offshore islands in mainland Greece, and the coastline is winding. Although most of the captains of the entire fleet have extensive sailing experience in the Aegean Sea, they still drive the ships carefully in order to successfully pass through this long and narrow channel.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is a city-state at the northern end of Euboea called Artemisium. The people of the city-state were very panicked when they saw countless ships suddenly appearing in the sea near the port. They closed the city gates and the port, and all the young and middle-aged citizens came to the city on guard with weapons in hand.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Under their horrified gaze, this huge ship The fleet did not approach the coast, but slowly moved westward.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Finally, the Theonia fleet entered the Gulf of Maliakos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Between the mountains on the southern border of Thessaly and the rolling mountains on the northern border of Central Greece There is a river called Sperceos flowing in the middle. The river has flowed for thousands of years, forming a long and narrow riverside plain. At its mouth, there is also a large tidal flat, only in the northwest of the bay. There is a pebbled beach and a port on the side.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Theonian fleet approached without stopping for a moment. Patroclus followed the 12th Army to land first. He did not let the landing soldiers attack not far from it. Instead of ordering the Twelfth Legion to rush westward quickly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   These soldiers from the Campania plain and the Samnite mountains had accepted the command of Patroclus a few years ago and created a plan to annihilate the Gallic invasion. The army was brilliant, so they trusted Patroclus' command and formed a column without hesitation. Their feet in leather sandals stepped on the hard and slippery cobblestones and stumbled towards the west. The

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   city of Lamia was far away from the landing site .
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   About 15 miles and about an hour later, the soldiers of the Twelfth Legion rushed to the city out of breath.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Patroclus saw that the gates of Lamia were closed and the city was full of soldiers, and his heart sank: Lamia people Already prepared!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Patroclus was already mentally prepared for this. After all, the slow speed of the fleet in the narrow channel most likely gave the Lamians time to be fully alert.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the raid failed, Patroclus was very Quickly adjust your mentality, call the messenger, have him ride a horse to the landing place, and inform the troops behind: capture the port first, and then come to meet up.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the messengers left, he ordered the soldiers of the Twelfth Legion to rest where they were and regain their strength. He led his guards to observe the defense deployment and surrounding geography of Lamia City up close.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lamia is somewhat similar to Peleus. It was also founded by the Thessalian people. Because the city is located outside the traditional territory of Thessaly and the transportation is not convenient, other Thessaly city-states are alienated from it, and even Some believe that Lamia was not a Thessalian city-state.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Lamians themselves also despised their Thessalian identity and preferred to get closer to the Greeks in the south. Although some Greek people regarded them as barbarians, they did have deeper contacts with the Greek city-states in the south. Of course, it was also because of their close ties with the Greek city-states in the south. City-states have more convenient sea transportation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Jason became Tagus of Thessaly, he did not rush to force Lamia to join the Thessaly League because he was afraid of arousing the vigilance of the Greek city-states in the south.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was not until the Battle of Leuctra and the disastrous defeat of the Greek overlord Sparta that he finally did not conceal his ambitions. When he led the army from Thebes back to Thessaly, he destroyed the city of Heraclea (not Dio). The Kingdom of Nea (in the city of Heraclea in Magna Greece) occupied Thermopylae. Lamia succumbed to his force, but was still unwilling to do so. Therefore, when Jason launched military mobilization this time, Lamia Asia did not provide many soldiers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now the Lamians feel fortunate that they still have enough strength to protect themselves in the face of the Theonian army's surprise attack.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   An hour later, the 10th Legion, the 11th Legion, the 3rd Cavalry Legion and the Gallic Brigade all arrived one after another... The
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lamian citizen soldiers stood on the city wall, their breathing almost stopped: countless men wearing black helmets and black armor arrived. Onian soldiers stood all over the river plain south of the city of Lamia, like the black tide roaring from the coast of Maliakos, as far as the eye could see.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What is particularly eye-catching are the Theonian soldiers (actually Gaulish soldiers) standing under the city. They are tall and strong, with fierce faces. They wear horn helmets and enamel armor, hold big swords, and roar like thunder. One after another, humanoid beasts make people feel heart-stopping...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just as the citizens of Lamia were shocked by the powerful power of the Theonian army, Patroclus did not immediately issue an order to attack the city. He had carefully observed Lamia before. Mia City: The Lamians should have learned the city-building habits of the Greeks. Instead of building the city on a flat plain along the river, they built it close to the mountains to the north and included a low hill within the city. Its acropolis is located on the north and left and right sides, surrounded by hills with a height of more than 200 meters. Although it provides a barrier for the city, it also limits the expansion of the city. Therefore, the Lamians can only expand the city to the plains to the south. , making the entire city of Lamia look like a pottery bottle with a long neck and a round bottom. Such a geographical location makes the Lamians feel that they have a good defensive advantage. They only need to focus on defending the southern city wall. Ensure the safety of Lamia City.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Patroclus ordered the Twelfth Legion and the Gallic Brigade to attack the hills on the south and north sides respectively.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the height of the hill is not too low, the slope is gentle. Although the Lamians have a defensive camp on the top of the hill, they do not have many troops. More than half of the 12th Legion are Samnite soldiers. They and the Gauls are both He is good at mountain warfare and is very tough. After suffering some casualties, he occupied the top of the mountain.
