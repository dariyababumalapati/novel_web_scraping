   Chapter 1146: Landing in Messenia (continued)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Understood!" Muklu responded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Ionicus heard this, he was puzzled: How could the warship attack the army on land?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a while, he saw a dozen triremes lined up side by side, heading straight towards the coast where the Spartan army was. The warships stopped on the sea less than one mile away from the Spartan army. Because it had hit the bottom, the crew on the deck immediately threw the anchor into the sea to fix the ship, and then a piece of equipment was lifted onto the deck from the cabin - a ballista.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Some of the gunners are responsible for fixing the mount of the ballista, some are responsible for mapping target parameters, some are responsible for installing spring groups, and some are responsible for carrying stone bullets... Not only this ballista team performs their duties and cooperates with each other tacitly, but also others The same is true on the warship.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the end of the Western Mediterranean War, when the Theonian army besieged the city of Carthage, naval warships entered the lagoon and placed ballistae on the decks to assist the army in siege and achieved considerable results. So far, the use of ballistae on ships has become A project of naval military training.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dolios saw the Theonian warships rushing straight towards the beach, thinking that they were going to land soon, and immediately commanded the army to spread out in a loose horizontal formation facing the direction of the dozen or so warships, with the front It was a helot holding a javelin, ready to attack the Theonian soldiers with a javelin first when they waded ashore.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, these warships stopped when they were approaching the beach, and there was no movement for a while. Dolios was feeling strange when he suddenly saw small black dots flying out of the warships one after another...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When he saw these small black dots clearly When they turned out to be large round stones, they had already fallen from mid-air. Some fell into the sea water in front, raising water columns soaring into the sky, and some fell onto the beach behind, causing sand and soil to splash everywhere. Although there was no One person was killed or injured, but the Hittites' momentum caused a commotion in the team, especially the Helots.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ballista!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A word popped into Dolios' mind. Although this kind of weapon had never been used in wars in mainland Greece so far, for the Spartans who had always been paying attention to the Western Mediterranean, they were This is not unknown.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus once made a suggestion to the Council of Elders, hoping to create such a powerful siege weapon. The Council of Elders also agreed to his proposal, but a man who had no other profession except a warrior and was keen on military training did not A city-state that abandons science, literature, art and entertainment simply does not have the technical ability to produce it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Spartans also wanted to secretly invite the people of Syracuse for advice, but unfortunately after the Battle of South Italy, Theonia captured the entire engineering team of Syracuse and took them completely for themselves. As a result, Syracuse itself also lost this technology, and in the end the matter fell into disrepair.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dolios never expected that he would witness the rumored ballista on such a special occasion, and for a moment he didn't know how to deal with it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, another round of stone bullets was ejected, and only one of the dozen stone bullets hit the target on the shore. After all, the warship fluctuated with the waves, and it was difficult for the ballistae to aim.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But the effect of the stone bullet that hit was very obvious. It smashed the head of a helot into pieces. The death was terrifying, and the surrounding helots were frightened and immediately turned around and ran away.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dolios hurriedly ordered the Spartans to kill the first black slaves to escape. This frightened the other slaves and managed to maintain the array.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not long after, the sound of bugles sounded on the sea, and hundreds of troop transport ships originally parked behind the warships began to move forward against the receding tide, and the landing of the Theonian army began.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The troop transport that Max was riding happened to be heading in the direction of the enemy's position on the shore. He himself had landed on the coast of Africa and also on the coast of Alpine Gaul. He was no stranger to landing, but this was the first time he had landed on it. Facing enemy interception, he did not follow the previous two methods and asked the soldiers to assist the sailors in rowing so that the ship could reach the coast faster. Instead, he asked them to put on their armor and weapons as soon as possible and sit quietly on the ship. , conserve physical strength.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The troop transport bumped forward in the tide and was not very fast. This was actually a good fighter for the Spartan army on the shore, but it was a pity that the Theonian army came suddenly and Sparta itself did not produce bows and arrows. It was too late to recruit the allies, so it was impossible to fire arrows at the troop transport.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The troop transport finally ran aground near the beach, less than a hundred meters away from the Spartan troops on the shore. Just as Max urged the soldiers to disembark, the Spartan soldiers on the shore also ordered the helots holding javelins to attack those who had not yet landed. The enemy attacks.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The helots waded forward cautiously, paying more attention to the stone bullets whizzing by in the sky.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Max led the soldiers to jump into waist-deep water one after another, and walked to the shore in no hurry. While he called on the soldiers to gather, he observed the positions of other units on the warships on the left and right sides.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Forward!" Under his order, 50 soldiers waded forward in a loose and unbroken small phalanx.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then he saw the helot harpooneers running from the shore: "Raise your shield!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as he shouted, the soldiers had already raised their long shields diagonally and blocked the front.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The helots who lacked military training faced the approaching Theonian soldiers. The javelins they threw in a hurry were neither accurate nor powerful, and did not pose any danger to the Theonian soldiers at all.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the contrary, after wading a certain distance through the water, the soldiers of the Theonian Legion also threw the javelins in their hands, which immediately caused many helots to be shot and fell into the water, scaring other helots to retreat hurriedly. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the direct threat from the front was eliminated, the soldiers of the detachment led by Max slowed down. They moved closer to the surrounding detachments and gradually became one.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dolios, who was on the shore, originally thought that after jumping into the sea, the Theonian soldiers in the boat would speed up and rush to the shore, and their strength would be dispersed. This would help him concentrate his troops and defeat them one by one, but he did not expect that Theonian soldiers would speed up and rush to the shore. The Onian soldiers were so steady and experienced that they gradually formed an array while wading slowly forward, and the array continued to thicken and lengthen...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dolios turned his head and looked to both sides again, at the beach in the distance. Countless Theonian soldiers had already come ashore and began to surround them...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dolios felt nervous, but he only hesitated for a moment before making a decision resolutely: "Quick, retreat! Retreat!!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Some Spartan warriors were unwilling to give up, but they were known in Greece for their discipline. As soon as the order was issued, all the soldiers quickly began to retreat, and the helots dispersed in a rush.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Max and the soldiers originally expected to have a fierce battle with the Spartan army on the beach, but they did not expect that the enemy in front ran away before the battle!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Is this really the Spartan warrior who dominated Greece?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to prevent fraud, although the soldiers accelerated their pace, they still maintained the integrity of their formation. However, under the command of the team officer, they began to shout in unison: "Messenians, you are free!!! ……"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ……………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leotichides set foot on the land of Messenia with an indifferent expression, but his mood was a bit complicated: he had no idea about this land. It was no stranger. When he was young, he had received military training here, and he and his companions had killed helots like wild beasts at the coming-of-age ceremony. He had also been stationed in Pylos for a period of time...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He originally thought that these The memories have been forgotten, but the moment he steps on the beach, these memories keep popping up.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides led dozens of guards step by step, stepping on the soft sand, and walked forward slowly. Tisias and Ionicus who were originally following him had already disappeared. They were anxious to appease and recruit the black laborers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   An officer with a purple tassel on his helmet came running towards him. He rushed to Leoticides and gave him a military salute.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Adoris, what was the result of the battle?" Even when facing the adopted son of King Davos, Leoticides still looked as indifferent as he did to other officers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Adoris replied with some frustration: "It is said that the Spartans are the bravest warriors in Greece, but I think that is a lie! They are as timid as rabbits, they run away before they fight, and they run very fast. , before we could form a siege, they rushed into the mountains to the east... It would be great if the cavalry could attack!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ledes told me that their horses were bumpy on the ship for several days and were in very bad condition. , you must rest for a few days before you can go into battle, otherwise there will be problems." Leoticides said lightly: "It seems that you got nothing this time?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When we pursued the Spartan military camp, there was a Spartan Officer Da and a few soldiers were guarding the door -" When Azalis said this, his face became more solemn: "They asked to fight our soldiers alone, and injured several of us because of this. In the end, we killed those Spartans and captured the officer."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides didn't pay much attention to such trivial matters, but asked: "What are the conditions of the Spartan military camp?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Adoris immediately understood what he meant and replied: "It's very complete, without any damage, but the area is not very large, and can barely accommodate a legion."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides looked at the sky, and then looked at it again All around: Naked helots could be seen everywhere, obediently following the Theonian soldiers...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He lowered his head and pondered for a while, and echoed: "Muklu, you go and notify Sekerian immediately, and say landing. The battle is over. Let him lead all the warships to dock on the beach and build a camp. I will send soldiers from the Fourth and Sixth Legions to fully assist."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thanks for the reward of Huangsha Huangsha and Landing on MJ is a painful thing!
