   Chapter 1270 Racing Competition (3)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "So you refused?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "How is it possible!" Saustatus' eyes widened: "Those Ministry of Commerce officials came to discuss with me under the orders of the consul! Clotto Cartax, that is the next king, do I dare to refuse! In the past two days, I have been busy persuading those unreasonable guys in the Thuliyi Chamber of Commerce. Concession..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Although you have suffered some losses, but the Archon remembers you, and the Ministry of Commerce still owes you such a big favor, I think it will be more beneficial to your future business!" Peparisius Said with some envy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Who knows what will happen in the future? His Majesty Davos has known about me for a long time, but everything has to be developed by his own efforts." Saustatus shrugged, said something self-deprecating, and then looked at Pebarisius Si: "I envy your Chamber of Commerce. Unlike us, who have so many troubles, not only did the profits soar during the games, but they also received praise from everyone!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Profits soared?!" Pebaricius shook his head: "I'm afraid you haven't ridden on our Chamber of Commerce's carriage during this time. Don't you know that at this time when the demand for carriages is extremely strong, the fees we charge are the same as usual, but they are much more tiring than usual, especially for those who Athletes and foreign VIP envoys must be picked up and dropped off in a timely manner from dawn to dusk... These are all agreements reached by our Carriage Chamber of Commerce and the Ministry of Commerce in advance."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this point, Pebaricius's expression became extremely solemn: "But as a map, we The citizens of Liyi and Theonia should contribute their share at this critical time. As long as the kingdom can successfully host this sports meeting, this will be the pride of all of us!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   That's it! That's it!" Saustatus responded repeatedly. He knew very well that many officers who had been in the regular legions for a long time, even if they retired, still spoke in this way. So he quickly changed the subject, called Heskraus, and then said : "I would like to introduce you to a friend, Hesklaus, the Peleus businessman who works with me!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then, he introduced to Hesklaus: "The person in front of you is a big shot! His father is Dai One of the founders of the Theonian Cavalry Legion, a famous hero of the kingdom! He himself was once an officer of the First Theonian Cavalry Legion and had made great military exploits, and now he is in charge of the huge Thurii carriage Chamber of Commerce, you must obey his command when traveling in Thurii!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Heskraus immediately bowed respectfully and saluted: "Lord Peparisius, it is my honor to know you!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hearing "Peleus "" The word "Pebarisius" moved in his mind. Since the Greek War, many upper-class people in Thurii knew that King Davos was born in Peleus of Thessaly, so he hurriedly supported Heskraus. And asked with interest: "Don't listen to Sostatus's bragging. I'm just a businessman like you. What do you do?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Heskraus and I work together in pottery, and Turiyi is a businessman." The 'Athenian Pottery Shop' in the market is his property." Saustatus continued: "Before this sports meeting, His Majesty personally sent people to the store to order pottery!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Did His Majesty meet you? "Pebarius looked at Heskraus with a desire in his eyes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "No... not yet..." Hesklaus lowered his eyes guiltily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Although not, your great Majesty knows everything, so he sent Mr. Ribazo to personally deliver the order to the store." Saustatus interrupted again with a smile.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pebaricius pondered for a moment and smiled: "Since you are favored by His Majesty, it means that the quality of your pottery is very good. If I have time, I will introduce members of our chamber of commerce to buy your pottery."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hesclaw Si expressed his gratitude profusely.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Saustatus looked calm, he felt quite happy inside: in the past few days, in various arenas, he had successfully sold Hesklaus's pottery to many upper-class people in this way.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Dad, the game is about to begin!" Lilrias' urging shout came from behind.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Amidst the noise from the surrounding audience, the three of them, like other spectators, soon saw: At the railing of the tall royal stand next to them, at some point stood King Davos wearing a golden crown, with his arms stretched out in mid-air. The right hand is holding a red cloth towel, which is extremely eye-catching.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Suddenly, he let go of his right hand, and the red cloth fluttered and fell...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The 8 starting gates on the east side of the stadium bounced open at the same time under the action of the mechanism, and 8 tanks rushed out.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The entire stadium suddenly erupted into thunderous cheers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The 32 horses, which had been impatient for a long time, raised their hooves vigorously, the wheels spun, and the carriage rumbled forward.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The eight well-equipped drivers held the reins tightly with one hand and raised the whip with the other. They shouted loudly and whipped the horses. The reason why they let the horses run hard from the beginning was mainly to grab a good position.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is important to know that the 8 starting gates are located close to each other in a fan shape, and their ranking has a greater impact on the start of the car. The position closest to the center of the field (i.e., the strip isolation zone) is the most advantageous, and the position closest to the spectator seats is the most advantageous. Poor, although the Theonia Games emphasize fair competition, it is inevitable that there will be favoritism. This is human nature. For example, the racing cars in the Turiyi area on the field are arranged at the starting point closest to the central spine. In the door, based on the close relationship with the kingdom, the following are: Bruti region, Po River region, West Numbia, Egypt, Thebes, Macedonia, Cyrenaica is ranked at the outermost, after all, it Theonia and Theonia are only friendly neighbors, not allies.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So as soon as the race started, the eight cars rushed to the track at full speed, and they were quickly separated from each other. Procris, the player from Turiyi, took the lead.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Sobox died in the battle, Procris was only a child, but Sobox had laid a solid foundation for his family during his lifetime. His carriage shop owned more than a dozen carriages and dozens of employees. He is the president of the newly established Turui Carriage Chamber of Commerce, and is well-known throughout Theonia (the kingdom had not been established at that time, it was only an alliance, and the territory it encompassed was not large).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After his death, the eldest son Peibarisius was not very careful about running the carriage industry at first, but devoted all his enthusiasm to the cavalry, so he was promoted to captain of the first legion at a young age.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Unfortunately, he was unlucky. In the Battle of Wolsey, he was injured and fell off his horse. Unfortunately, his leg bones were crushed by a horse, causing permanent disability. He had to retire, and then devoted all his energy to the carriage industry.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because he is a retired veteran and has meritorious service, coupled with his father's legacy, he has received support and help from many parties. His career has grown along with the expansion of the kingdom. Not only has the family's carriage house expanded from Turii to other towns. , and also began to get involved in the manufacture of carriages, which also gave Pebarius a lot of prestige in the carriage industry throughout the kingdom.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Compared with his brother who had experienced ups and downs and was shrewd and capable, Procris naturally pales in comparison. He has been living a carefree life under the protection of his father and brother, and has no amazing performance. Instead, because he inherited his father's hobby - he likes to drive, he secretly acts as a coachman from time to time. , driving for the people of Turiyi, and became a joke among the upper-class young people in Turiyi.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Davos announced that he would host the Theonian Games, Procris decided to participate in the racing competition and prove himself with the glory of the championship.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   To this end, he received strong support from his brother, who not only searched for horses from all over the Mediterranean that were most suitable for traffic jams, but also hired drivers who had won sports racing championships to coach him.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Procris has been training unremittingly for two years just for today...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the moment when the starting gate opened and the carriage sprinted out, countless thoughts flashed through Procris's heart, which soon turned into a firm and high-pitched voice. He shouted: "Drive! Drive!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A moment later, his carriage was already charging forward. From the corner of his eye, he caught sight of the arena staff standing on the platform of the center spine with buckets in their hands. His excitement cooled down slightly. After a moment, I immediately remembered the coach's instructions and began to pull the reins back slightly to make the equally excited horses slow down a bit. After all, this is not a single short race, but 7 round trips, a total of The long race of more than fourteen miles requires continuous endurance. You cannot push hard at the beginning, but you will be unable to speed up the sprint in the second half of the race.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just when he was controlling the speed of his horse with all his strength, a shout of "Wow!" suddenly sounded from outside him. He turned around and saw that a carriage was already chasing him. The driver was wearing a horned helmet and roared at him with bared teeth. The face is vicious.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Damn Gauls!" Procris shouted to him not to be outdone. There was no need to worry that the other party would attack him angrily, not to mention that both parties were citizens of Theonia, and the referees repeatedly criticized the participants. The players in the racing competition repeatedly emphasized: "To ensure the safety of the competition, you must not maliciously infringe or harm your opponents during the competition, otherwise you will be disqualified from the competition!" The
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Gallic players' approach was just a psychological tactic, and Procris did not do it. He was moved and concentrated on driving the carriage... The statue of Poseidon on the central platform and the equestrian statue of King Davos flashed past the corner of his eyes. There were three pillars standing in front of him. He knew that he needed to turn.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The 500-meter straight distance takes a while for a runner to complete, but for a four-horse racing car running at full speed, it only takes a few blinks of the eye.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, turning at high speed is a great test of the driver's control ability. Procris did not dare to relax at all. He controlled the reins tightly and kept the carriage close to the center platform. The four white horses drove side by side, almost at the same time. Go around the pillars.
