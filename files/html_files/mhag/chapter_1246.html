   Having said this, Plessinas stood up, raised his palms to the sky, and respectfully performed a priestly salute to Davos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos also solemnly returned the priestly salute (according to the "Theonia Law", the King of Theonia is also the high priest of the Temple of Hades), and then said half-jokingly and half-seriously: "My Priest of the Wand, make no mistake, the Theonian Games is a grand ceremony held for the gods, not just for the great Hades." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty, this is indeed what we declare to the outside world, but as the leader of the entire priesthood As the referee team and host of the entire games, the Temple of Hades will undoubtedly expand our influence in the Mediterranean through this games and strengthen communication and management of other temples." Plessinas said seriously: " Although the Temple of Hades has the power to supervise other temples according to the laws of the kingdom and the alliance agreement, and with the approval of His Majesty 10 years ago, it officially began to hold the annual meeting of priests of the kingdom and allied temples, but in recent years, except In addition to the active cooperation of the temple priests in the kingdom, the temple priests of the allies are more or less reluctant and perfunctory. The priests of Olympia, Delphi and Athens are the least cooperative. At the annual temple meeting, they either They find various reasons not to come, or they only send low-status candidates, and we cannot severely punish them. After all, they only accept the supervision of the Hades Temple in name only, and they achieve their goals through strong means. It violates Hades' principles of mercy and freedom of belief.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This time, the rumors about 'the priests of Olympia, Delphi, Corinth and Athens refused to come to Thurii to serve as judges' are indeed true. I think this is understandable, after all. They all have their own games, and according to past traditions, they rarely invite each other's priests to serve as referees in their games.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Our games face the entire Mediterranean, and even extended invitations to the enemy country Persia. , up to now, the range of athletes registered for the Games is so wide, the number is so large, the championship prizes are so generous, and the number of sports events held is so large... Its scale will definitely exceed all other Games, so these priests do not want to see the Theonian Games held, and are worried that it will take away the glory enjoyed by these traditional games. I can understand their concerns, but this kind of covering their eyes and pretending not to see anything But their cowardly mentality makes me feel ridiculous and a little pity for them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Judging from what I know so far, the number of tourists who will come to Thurii to watch the games will definitely exceed the previous sports games, and they are also from the Mediterranean The scope is very wide, which shows that the Theonian Games has become the focus of attention of the entire Mediterranean world. The lack of these four priests has no impact on us, because other allies have actively sent their own Acropolis temples The priests of Mantinea, Thebes, Argos, Euboea, Crete, etc. are even led by the officiating priest. Now we have a sufficient number of priests and referees in the sports meeting, and they have become more proficient in it after training. The rules and penalty standards for each competition, and the referee team has formulated two main rules after discussion. One is to draw lots to determine the referees for each competition, and the other is to give a speech to the players on the field and the audience before the game. Announce the name of the referee and the god he serves. Players in this game must follow the referee to swear an oath to the god to ensure that the game is fair.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I believe that after the Games, some previously unknown temple gods will begin to attract public attention, and some previously well-known temple gods will spread their fame across their own races and throughout the Mediterranean.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is not our regret but theirs that the priests of Olympia, Delphi, Athens, and Corinth did not participate in the Theonian games.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   His Majesty once said, 'The Theonian Games will not be held just once, but will be held every four years like the Olympian Games.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   'I believe that maybe when the 2nd or 3rd Theonian Games are held, they will take the initiative to request to participate without us actively inviting them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " Well said, Plessinas!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Davos patted the armrests of the seat with both hands and said in a slightly excited voice: "The Theonian Games will set off a new trend with a new competition format and an unprecedented scale, becoming the largest celebration in the entire Mediterranean. , becoming the most dazzling poem showing the image and national power of Theonia!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After saying that
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   , Davos calmed down a little, and then asked: "Do you have any questions?"
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Affected by the entire report, everyone seemed a little excited and whispered to each other.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Suddenly, a voice sounded: "Your Majesty, we don't have any problems. Now we are looking forward to the sports meeting as soon
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   as possible. As soon as these words came out, there was an uproar in the hall. With a kind smile, it was obvious that this was recognized by everyone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was Haka, the auxiliary minister, who spoke. As a relative of Clotokatax, he had been trying his best to help the consul.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos took advantage of the situation and said: "Thank you to Clotokatax, Plessinas, Haka, Tellis... the entire preparatory team members, you have done a great job so far! Is there any more games? It will be held in a month. I hope you will not relax and continue to work hard until the sports meeting ends smoothly and successfully. Then I will celebrate for you!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Yes, Your Majesty!!" Clotokatax and others immediately bowed. body responds.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Holding the Games is the most important event in the kingdom today. I hope everyone will try their best to cooperate with the preparatory team to ensure its success!" Davos looked around at everyone, tapping his fingers on the throne. After a while, he said: "The Games We will discuss the matter here for the time being. Do you have anything else to do next?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty." Assistant Minister Haka said: "Since this year, the Liguria region has been invaded twice by the Gauls from outside the mountains. Although It didn't cause any losses, but it can't help but arouse our vigilance! Three days ago, Hasdrubal, the commander of the northern border, wrote a letter requesting his troops to attack from the pass along the coast to attack the nearby Gallic tribe settlements outside the mountains. Thoroughly guarantee the security of the northern border, but the Ministry of Military Affairs has not given a clear reply so far. Does your Majesty have any special considerations on this matter?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since Theonia conquered Gaul in the mountains, and successfully suppressed Gaul several times, The people's rebellion has made their rule over the middle reaches of the Po River more and more stable. The Veneti people in the lower reaches of the Po River are afraid of the power of Theonia and take the initiative to surrender to Theonia and become a subsidiary.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Only the Ligurians in the upper reaches of the Po River showed strong hostility towards Theonia and frequently provoked disputes in the border areas, causing Theonia to go to war with it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But unlike the conquest of mountainous Gaul, the war between Theonia and Liguria was a small-scale, long-term battle, often fought between the border legions guarding the Po River area and one or two Ligurian tribes. In the battle, the Gallic reserve brigade later assisted, and the spies sent by the kingdom continued to divide and win over the Ligurian tribes. The Theonian side always had the absolute upper hand.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since Theonia is fighting nearby, not many troops are dispatched in each battle, which puts little pressure on logistical supplies. Therefore, the war that slowly encroached on the Ligurians lasted for 7 years, and they were completely occupied last year. The whole territory, and a new border corps was sent to guard the Liguria region. Hasdrubal was appointed as the commander of the northern border of Italy, under the jurisdiction of the two border corps in the north. If necessary, he also has the command of the 19th Temporary command of the Legion of Legion (based in the Po region).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The Ministry of Military Affairs has reported this to me. I appreciate Commander Hasdrubal's determination to maintain the security of the northern border." Davos replied solemnly: "But these two areas in the north It is very different from other regions. The Ligurians and the mountain Gauls are both very strong races. It has been more than 10 years since the Po River region was integrated into the kingdom, but the integration of the Gauls into the kingdom is still slow. This is us The reason why the border legions are still stationed in its territory, and Liguria has just been incorporated into the kingdom, the situation is still unstable.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And according to the report of the Ministry of Military Affairs, the invasion of the Gauls outside the mountains does not pose any threat to us. They can only pass through The invasion of the seaside pass, and our border army built a strong fortress there, easily repelled their attack, and did not cause any losses to the Liguria region. Therefore, for a long time to come, the northern The mission of the Border Corps is still to guard the border and maintain regional stability, and it is not advisable to take risks.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, based on the intelligence we have received from the Massilians over the years, although the terrain north of the Alps is densely forested, the terrain is flat and vast. The land is fertile and is home to thousands of Gaulish tribes with a large population. It is not advisable for us to risk crossing the Alps for the time being without adequate preparation, lest it trigger a protracted war between the Gauls and the kingdom outside the mountains!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " Your Majesty, since this is the case, should we ask the Intelligence Department to send personnel to conduct a detailed investigation of the Gaul area outside the mountains, and then... divide and win over those tribes that are friendly to our kingdom to prepare for possible wars in the future..." Haha Ka considered it and said: "In addition... can the Ministry of Foreign Affairs send envoys to the Gaul tribes outside the mountains adjacent to the Liguria region to express the kingdom's friendship to them? If we can carry out trade with them, I believe that not only can the mountains be Reducing the invasion of the Liguria region by the TransGauls will also be conducive to the development of northern border trade."
