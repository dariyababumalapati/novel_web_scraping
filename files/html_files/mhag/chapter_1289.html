   Chapter 1289 Agesilaus' Request
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Leotychides disliked Agesilaus, this did not prevent him from being inclined to agree with the suggestions of this veteran who had been fighting in Asia Minor for many years and to formulate a plan accordingly. New battle plan.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the following days, the active approach of the Persian army in Asia Minor also confirmed Agesilaus's judgment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides did not rush to meet the enemy immediately and start a decisive battle with the Persian army. Instead, he led his army to retreat, but the direction of retreat was not towards Ilion in the west, but towards Chios in the southwest. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Persian army pursued them closely, especially the cavalry as the vanguard. They fought many times with the cavalry units left to block the Greek coalition. The Persians, who had a superior number of cavalry, naturally had the upper hand in the battle, and their repeated victories also contributed to their success. He lost the arrogance of the Persians and was even more eager to fight with the Greek coalition.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Greek coalition forces withdrew from the Alispi Plain relatively smoothly, but the closer they got to the coast, the terrain became more undulating, and the marching speed naturally slowed down.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Finally, on the afternoon of the 12th day, the Persian army in Asia Minor was only six or seven miles away from the Greek coalition.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This time Leoticides ordered the army to stop advancing early and camp on the spot to rest.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Half an hour later, the Persian cavalry arrived and were shot back by the archers already deployed by the Greek coalition. However, they did not move away, but lingered in the distance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides did not send cavalry to drive them away. Instead, he stood on a high place with other allied generals and looked towards the direction of the Persian cavalry.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Near dusk, a huge cloud of dust slowly moved in from the north and stopped three miles away, but the noise could clearly reach the ears of the generals.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It seems that the Persians think that we can no longer escape, and are planning to camp there to rest first, and then come to fight with us tomorrow." Ipamironda pointed at the fog in front and seriously suggested: "Proso General Us, look at the dust mist that is still rolling in. It can be seen that the Persian army was a little confused after stopping to rest. They pursued it for a long time, and the soldiers must be very tired. Do we need to use this opportunity to lead the army to attack?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides pondered for a moment, shook his head and said: "Our soldiers are also tired. Let them have a good night's rest and replenish their energy for a decisive battle with the Persians tomorrow. Besides, it is very possible to attack at this time. It will scare away the enemies that have finally been lured over."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing this, the generals smiled knowingly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Everyone, come with me to the military tent for another military meeting to renegotiate and clarify tomorrow's battle plan."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Leoticides finished speaking, everyone agreed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ……………………………………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The meeting ended, and the Allied generals took their leave one after another. Only Leoticides and four others were left in the big tent. A commander of the Theonian Army, and a special figure Agesilaus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leotychides was slightly surprised to see Agesilaus still staying in the tent, and was about to ask.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The former King of Sparta spoke first: "Generals, I want to have a private chat with Commander Leoticides."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The four legion commanders looked at each other and saw that although Leoticides He didn't speak, but he didn't express his refusal either, so he prepared to leave knowingly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But Leotychides said: "You guys wait outside the tent for a while, it won't be long."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the four people came out of the tent, Agesilaus came to Leotychides, full of people. A smile appeared on his wrinkled face: "I think back when I led the Spartan army to fight in Asia Minor, although I won some victories, it took so long but I didn't get much victory. On the contrary, after I led my troops back to Greece , those places that were originally conquered soon became the possessions of the Persians. This is my regret and the regret of the Spartans!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But this time the war against Persia launched by Theonia was obviously different from the previous wars between Greece and Greece. The war in Persia is different. The slogan of "Revenge against Persia" that we have been shouting for decades may really come true! Not only do I think so, but Ipamilonda and Iphicrates also think so, so that's why Just now, they were scrambling to get their own city-state armies to take on the most important offensive mission.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides, if you can serve as the commander-in-chief of the Greek coalition to defeat the Persian army, this will be our Spartans-"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides frowned and interrupted him impatiently: "I've told you many times, my name is Proseus. If you shout names randomly in the future, please don't enter my big tent again! Yes! Tell me what's going on quickly, I'm very busy, don't talk so much nonsense!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A sad look flashed across Agesilaus's face, he exhaled softly, made up his mind, threw the crutch in his hand aside, and then He squatted down tremblingly, put his hands on the ground, slowly knelt down on his knees, and bent over, "Bang!" His forehead hit the ground, once, twice, three times...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leotichides was stunned for a moment. After being stunned for a long time, he lowered his face and shouted in a low voice: "Agesilaus, what do you mean?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus straightened up, with a black patch on his forehead. The continuous kowtow movements just now were a bit fast, which made him His breathing became rapid, he coughed for a while, and then said feebly: "...I was the one who was sorry for your mother and you back then. I don't want to be forgiven by you!...But I hope you can see that you were Si For the sake of the people of Sparta, can you promise me one thing..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides looked down at him with an indifferent expression: "Tell me and listen."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus sighed: "Sparta was defeated. I have no complaints about the conquest of Theonia, because Theonia is indeed far stronger than Sparta, and it defeated us openly. We are where we are today. Perhaps this is what Zeus has said about us in the past decades. The whole of Greece was punished for being too arrogant!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But... no matter how miserable the noble descendants of Heracles were, it would not be their turn to be humiliated by the lowly Piliases and Helots! But they were not only humiliated, but also wanted to Let us Spartans gradually die out! No, this will never be allowed!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus clenched his fists, his thin body trembling with anger: "So this time I made a strong request to King Davos, The Spartans formed a separate team to fight in order to find a way for us Spartans to survive. We had no choice but to leave Lagnia, which had raised us Spartans for hundreds of years, and move to a new place!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So I hope... I hope that when this war is over with victory, can you please ask King Davos on behalf of us Spartans to allocate this area of ​​​​the Alispi Plain near the Hellespont to Sparta? A small piece of land allows us Spartans to continue to survive and multiply..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Facing Agesilaus's expectant eyes, Leoticides frowned slightly: He was so in Theonia. For many years, although he has been used by King Davos, he has never asked for anything from the Supreme. Because of his arrogant temperament, it is difficult for him to ask. What's more, since landing in Asia Minor, he has been in this land for a long time. After a few months, I knew that the fertility of the Alispi Plain and the importance and prosperity of the Hellespont were not only coveted by the allies, but also would definitely be areas that the kingdom wanted to control. If Sparta wanted to cut it off from the kingdom's hands, I'm afraid it's not easy to get a small piece of meat.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He hesitated for a moment, but still said indifferently: "Why don't you ask His Majesty?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus slowly stood up, his sore legs almost made him fall. He hurriedly held on to the wooden chair next to him and gasped: "Of course I will ask King Davos...if he can agree. , even if I am asked to kneel down and kowtow, but I am afraid that I am not strong enough... It is not that I am greedy, if the new colony is not fat enough, how can the people be willing to leave Laconia... And wait until Theonia wins After Persia, the Hellespont and Alisby Plains will inevitably be under the control of the Kingdom of Theonia. Sparta is now relatively small and weak, and it will be safer to live next to the powerful Theonia. ..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This old guy is really trying to survive for Sparta... Leoticides looked at the old man in front of him who had difficulty even standing. He was silent for a moment, stretched out his foot to pick up the crutches on the ground, and then handed it to him. , reprimanded in a harsh tone: "As a general who leads the army, you should know very well how important the next battle is to us. I must concentrate on fighting this battle well. How can I have the mood to think about other things!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus took the crutch and smiled: "I understand... I understand... Don't worry!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the battle tomorrow, my soldiers will never embarrass Sparta!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After that, he walked slowly out of the tent with his cane. When he was about to walk out of the military tent, he suddenly stopped, turned around, and said with a very solemn expression: "To tell you the truth, regarding the death of your mother, I do feel guilty!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ...But as for forcing you to leave Sparta, now I think that is a good thing!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leotychides, from now on the young and old of Sparta will be entrusted to you!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Early on the second day, when Pharnabazos led the Persian governors to explore near the Greek coalition camp, he There was hesitation about whether to conduct a battle here.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because the two armies were located in a hilly area, the camp of the Greek coalition was at a high place. Although the slope was gentle, it was not too favorable for the attacking Persian side. Moreover, the camp The location is actually quite flat, but there are rolling hills with higher terrain on both sides of it. Although the distance between the hills on both sides is nearly 10 miles, it is not a narrow and conducive to defense. The terrain, but according to previous reconnaissance, the number of the Greek coalition forces clearly exceeds 50,000. Once the array is deployed during the battle, the two wings will not be far from the nearby hills, and the cavalry will not have enough room to maneuver. From the current situation, Look, the most dominant force in the Persian army is the cavalry.
