   Chapter 1076: What I saw and heard in the outer city of Turiyi is that
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus and his family are walking on the way to Turiyi. Except for Maximus himself, who has been sent by the slave camp several times to help in private workshops in the city, Fulvia Even though he and his two children had lived in a slave camp not far from Thurii for several years, they had never visited the largest city in the Western Mediterranean.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just the avenue leading to the city at their feet made them happy. It was flat and wide. There were deep drainage ditches on both sides of the road and neatly arranged street trees farther away from the drainage ditch, as well as under the street trees. Row of white stone monuments.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two children who walked out of the cage felt novel about everything. They shouted and chased each other on the sidewalk. When they were tired, they sat on the wooden bench by the roadside to rest for a while, and then curiously played with the three figures engraved on the top. White stone tablet with head dog statue.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Maximus would rush over and warn them to stay away from the stone monument, because it was the tombstone of the war dead of Thurii citizens of Theonia, and no one was allowed to desecrate it.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus heard someone say when he entered the city for the first time: the names of the soldiers who died in Theonia will be enshrined in the temple for people to worship and pay homage to, and their tombstones are erected on both sides of the avenue. Based on the wishes of their families and citizens, we hope that passers-by can learn about their heroic deeds and perceive the hard-won life today, while also deterring outsiders with evil intentions... It is
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   said that this approach is Originating from Thurii, it has now been imitated by towns across the kingdom.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus once had to sigh: Theonia gave such noble courtesy to the citizens who died in battle, how could it not let the living citizens risk their lives and continue fighting, so Theonia was able to destroy Rome, not because It comes from luck!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Children tend to forget when they are excited and playing. After the two of them were tired from running, they were sitting on the stone monument casually. They were caught by the patrol team. Not only did they reprimand them, but they were also fined 10 Obols. And also to check Maximus' identity.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After learning that Maxim was a liberated slave, the inspector specifically told him some laws that should be obeyed in Thurii City and warned him not to violate them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two children were obviously frightened and followed their parents closely from then on.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As we get closer and closer to the city of Turiyi, there are more and more pedestrians on the road. The fields on both sides of the road are gradually replaced by more and more houses...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Standing in the bustling flow of people, not only his wife and children, but also Mark Sim himself became a little frightened. Looking at the countless moving heads and overlapping houses in front of him, he couldn't even see the shadow of the inner city wall. He couldn't help but wonder: How huge is this? A city, can I really gain a foothold here?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus, who had imagined how he would live in Thurii City countless times, actually stood in front of this giant city. He deeply felt his own insignificance, but being close to his wife and children made him think again. Be strong and move forward with the flow of people like other people entering the city with the hope for a better life.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Half an hour later, they stood in front of the statue of Hermes. Maximus wiped his sweat and said, "The outer city of Thurii is ahead."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Fulvia's eyes widened: " After walking for so long, you still haven't entered the city of Turii?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Fulvia grew up in Rome. She felt that Rome, with a population of more than 100,000, was already a huge city, but it was different from the city in front of her. The comparison is simply dwarfed.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although she was born into a Roman aristocracy, she was also a traditional Roman woman. She usually raised children and took care of the housework, and her husband took care of everything else. At this time, she was even more out of ideas and asked in a panic: "Maximus..." …Where are we going?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus asked this question to freedmen and preparatory citizens many times when he was in the slave camp. He already had a set of plans after gaining freedom, and some compatriots are still unwilling to admit the reality. In comparison, he already has a clear understanding through various channels: Theonia has ruled most of the Italian peninsula. If his family still wants to survive on this familiar land, they can only live in Theonia. Within the territory of the kingdom, if you want to get a better life, of course you must become a citizen of Theonia as soon as possible.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So the first thing he had to do after becoming a liberated slave was to apply and register at the household registration office, willing to become a citizen of Theonia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So Maximus boldly asked a patrol team on patrol.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The patrol team member told him the location of the nearest patrol post rather enthusiastically.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After entering the outer city, the first feeling given to the Maximus family is that they can walk more freely. Pedestrians can walk on the main road in the middle. As long as they do not deliberately block traffic, the patrol team will not cause trouble for them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is because there are many shops on both sides of the road: furniture shops, ironware shops, cloth shops, pottery shops, cooking utensils shops, medicine shops, butcher shops, fruit stalls, vegetable stalls, bakeries... and some Rome and even other city-states did not do it at all. Some shops.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For example, the underwear shop (affiliated to the Christoya Chamber of Commerce) has guards guarding the door, and only women are allowed to enter, and most of the people who come in and out are women in gorgeous clothes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The school supplies shop - a store that specializes in selling student supplies. Maximus also took a closer look. The dazzling array of various study supplies are not only very finely made, but also relatively cheap. If not for the place of residence, they are still relatively cheap. Although he hasn't decided yet, he also wants to spend money to buy some for his children.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A sports equipment store, most of the products inside are rugby and football supplies.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two children looked curiously at the football star statues made of various materials placed on the shelves.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The shop clerk took the opportunity to sell Maximus: "If you want to buy it, I recommend you buy this. This is the statue of Prince Briantes, the third son of our great king. Even though he is only 16 At the age of 10, he has already played three times in our rugby matches in Thurii and scored a touchdown, but he is very popular with the children!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The king's son also participates in rugby matches!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   … Although Maximus was curious, he had no urge to buy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The medical tool shop sells more professional things, such as doctors' surgical instruments, instruments for treating fractures, instruments for treating trauma, etc. It is so complete that Maximus had to sigh: "No wonder it's so popular in the slave camp clinic. Doctors once proudly declared, 'Theonia's medical skills are the best in the entire Mediterranean!'"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Bathware shop, various styles of wooden bathtubs, stone bathtubs, bath herbs, spices, body shavers, razors , bath towels, lubricants, algae mud masks, etc... There is a dazzling array of everything, which shows the Theonians' love for bathing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is actually a flower shop here. Some of the flowers and plants that can be seen everywhere like weeds in the mountains of the Roman area are actually packed in clay pots and placed on the sales shelves. Although the prices are very cheap, there are not many people who come to buy them. , which surprised Fulvia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Turiyi people's habit of planting flowers and plants originated from the inner city.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the city of Thurii was rebuilt, in order to make the entire city beautiful and pleasing to the eye, Davos advocated that every household plant flowers and plants in their courtyards, and also asked Helps to lead doctors to publicize, saying, "Planting flowers and plants can make people happy." The air is fresh and good for health."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the city expanded outward, the concept of planting flowers and plants has been deeply rooted in people's hearts. However, many people in the outer city do not have spacious houses like those in the inner city, and some even live in very small houses. But they will plant flowers and plants in special earthen pots and place them on balconies or indoors to please themselves and others.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Later, many people were too busy to go to the wild to collect flowers and plants, so flower shops came into being.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Maximus has been to Turiyi City several times, he has always been in a hurry under the supervision of his employer. He has no time to wander around slowly. He just got free today. Although he still has something to worry about, he is still Attracted by the rows of shops on both sides of the street.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When he turned around, he found that his wife and children were not with him. He was immediately startled and searched hurriedly. Soon he saw two children jumping up and down on a row of small stone piers in the middle of the road ahead. His wife was trying hard to persuade them. return.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus rushed over and stopped the two naughty children from playing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Dad, these little stone mounds are so fun!" The 5-year-old son was pulled by Maximus and excitedly wanted to jump up again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Dad, why do the Theonians place so many stone pillars on the road? Isn't it easy to trip people?" the 7-year-old eldest son asked curiously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus looked at these small square stone piers arranged from one side of the road to the other. They were firmly welded to the road with cement. The stone piers were half a meter apart. He couldn't help feeling a little emotional. He patiently gave The children explained: "This is called a speed limit stone. You see, because there are many shops on the roadside and many people are buying things, some people have to walk to this avenue. However, you see, there are also There are many carriages and beasts of burden. If they run too fast, they can easily knock down people, right?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two children nodded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Then how can we prevent them from hitting people?" Maximus asked in a persuasive way.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The carriage is not allowed to enter the city." replied the 5-year-old son.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Those terrible uncles (referring to the patrol) did not allow the carriage to speed up." This was the answer of the eldest son.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus touched the heads of the two children and said seriously: "If the carriages are not allowed to enter the city, then so many things in these shops will have to be brought in from outside. Wouldn't it be very tiring! Those terrible things My uncle can indeed make the carriage move slowly, but there are so many carriages from morning to night, and they have to stare at them. Isn't it tiring? But this thing can make the coachman and grooms consciously slow down, because only when the wheels are just right Aiming between the stone piers, the carriage can pass smoothly, otherwise it may be crashed..."
