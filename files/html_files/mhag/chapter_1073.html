   Chapter 1073 Melses' last wish
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Divers listened carefully and finally nodded and said: "What you said will become an important basis for the tax rate discussion at the next executive meeting."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What are you still discussing... Your Majesty, just settle it directly." Melses muttered.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos seemed to have not heard anything. After seeing what he said, his spirit became even more depressed, so he said with concern: "You have a good rest, I will come to visit you next time!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, why don't you stay a little longer?! If you come back next time... I'm afraid you won't be able to see me..." Merses muttered again in a low tone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Davos heard this, his heart felt sour. Just when he was about to comfort him, he heard Merses say softly: "Your Majesty, do you still remember the first time we met?... At that time, you had just invented Smoked sausage temporarily solved the mercenary's ration storage problem... After I found out, I immediately asked Menon to have you in my baggage train... I still remember the story you told us about the treasure that night... Yes With your help, it was the most relaxing time I felt while marching in Persia... I had a vague feeling that you would become a great person... So when Menon and you conflicted, I stood firmly with you. This side...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now it proves how correct my choice was! ...I, a bankrupt small businessman from Ionia, eventually became the finance minister of the most powerful kingdom in the Western Mediterranean, with tens of thousands of wealth in my hands. How lucky I am! I have no regrets anymore…”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing what Mercis said, Davos didn't know what to say for a moment. He forced a smile and said: "Actually, what you said is wrong. You saw me once before I was transferred to the baggage team... …At that time, I took a walk to the baggage camp, and I was met by you. You suspected that I wanted to steal food because I was hungry, and you specifically asked the guards to drive me away."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "There is such a thing, I have no impression at all!" Mersith's eyes widened in surprise, and then he laughed: "It's a pity that I only know about it now, otherwise I would often brag to Antonios and Hilos... Say I am the only one who has ever reprimanded Your Majesty!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I just remembered it now, otherwise you would have had such an easy life under my hands in the past ten years?!” Davos also joked with a smile.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even the usually serious Martius smiled.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Henibris, who was on the side, listened to them telling their past events. From the laughter, he felt the deep friendship between each other, and he couldn't help feeling a little envious and yearning in his heart.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty." The smile on Melses's face had not disappeared, and he said in a deep voice: "After my death, I will donate most of my property to the kingdom..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Oh, you're a stingy guy and you're willing to do it?!” Davos teased with a smile, thinking he was joking.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I am serious, this is my will! I will donate 80% of my inheritance to the kingdom and leave only 20% to support my family!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos saw the serious look on Merses's face, and immediately stopped smiling, and asked in a deep voice: "Are you really willing to give up?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I don't have children, what's the point of being reluctant..." Merses murmured, a little absent-minded: "Your Majesty, you led us to build the Kingdom of Theonia through hard work. It can be regarded as ours." child……"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Davos heard this, he was quite moved. He sat on the edge of the bed, patted Mersith's swollen hand, and said emotionally: "On behalf of the kingdom, I thank you for your generosity!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, I am donating this money...can you buy me a statue...to be stationed in the Pantheon..." Merses' next words made Davos stunned, and then he laughed dumbly: This is Merses. True character!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos subconsciously wanted to scold him first: the qualification to enter the Pantheon is not a commodity and can be bargained for! …
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But seeing Melses' pale face and hopeful eyes, Davos softened his heart and said directly: "Even if you don't donate these properties, your past great contributions to the kingdom can make you undisputed. I have the qualifications to enter the Pantheon. Not only that, I am also planning to erect a statue of you in front of the Finance Department, so that future Finance Department officials will follow your example and be stingy with every Opal in the kingdom and never waste it. , let alone corruption!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Thank you, Your Majesty...Thank you, Your Majesty..." At that moment, turbid tears flowed from Merses's godless eyes...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After walking out of Merses' mansion, Davos couldn't help but stop and look back, thinking of Cornelus who passed away a few years ago, and of Merses who would go to the Elysee at any time. His heart was very heavy: he followed The heroes who founded Theonia together with him are gradually entering the end of their lives...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He was thinking about it when he turned around and saw Martius standing upright, but his gray beard showed his age, and he sighed in his heart: "Martius, you are old too..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, I can still easily defeat the young guard! I can still serve as your guard!" Martius answered forcefully.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Okay...okay..." Davos subconsciously touched his beard, and then said to Henipolis: "Have you remembered what I just said to Melses?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Henepolis immediately replied: "Remember, let Lord Melses enter the Pantheon and erect a statue to him in the Treasury."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Well, let's go back and draft a proposal and discuss it at the next executive meeting as soon as possible... I'm afraid Merses won't be able to hold on for long...” Davos let out a long sigh.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the past few days, a rumor suddenly appeared in Tulii: Etruscan envoys asked for help from the kingdom. At the same time, in view of the frequent harassment of indigenous people on the border of southern Iberia, King Davos was prepared to agree to the ministers' proposal and send separate One or two legions went to the southern border of Iberia and the northern border of Etruria to build fortresses to defend against the invasion of the indigenous people. According to the Ministry of Military Affairs, each legionnaire must be on duty at the station for at least half a year...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The news quickly spread throughout the city of Thurii, and soon spread to other cities. The officers, soldiers, reserve soldiers of each legion, as well as their families and relatives are discussing this matter every day. You must know that they account for a large proportion of the population of the kingdom, which naturally caused a huge stir across the country. of waves.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not long after, news came out: Those defensive fortresses would be built at the forefront of the border. There would be no town markets around them, only the indigenous people who kept coming to harass them. For the safety of the soldiers, the garrison troops might not consider giving them any protection. During their vacation, let them go to the towns behind to rest and relax, and even go home to visit relatives...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as this news came out, the citizens of the legionnaires were even more uneasy. Many anxious citizen soldiers gathered together and went to their respective military camps to ask the senior officers stationed in the military camps for detailed information and said: "We are not afraid. We fight against powerful enemies, even if they bleed or even sacrifice our lives; but we are afraid of being trapped in a fortress like criminals, without freedom for more than half a year, and completely unable to take care of our families..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Some radical citizens of Thurii even gathered together and went to the Senate to petition the senators: I hope they can oppose this proposal and not let it pass.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Many elders were confused and asked the rotating chairmen: "Does such a proposal really exist?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lysias and others said in a unified voice: "It is true that a minister made this suggestion, but your Majesty did not agree immediately and is still considering the matter carefully."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While the outside world was making a lot of noise, Davos was sitting quietly in the palace office. After listening to Aristelas' investigation report on the entire situation, he thought for a while and said: "The water has been boiled now. Now, let's put something in it first and see if we can cook something good.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Your Majesty.” Aristelas understood.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Any other news?”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, we have collected all the evidence against Servius, Phrius, Aulus...these former Roman nobles for their attempted rebellion." Aristelas said, respectfully handing over a stack of records in his hand. passed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos read it carefully and said calmly: "There are still a lot of people. While the public's attention is focused on the dispatch of border troops, transfer these evidences and lists to the Thurii Inspection Department. Let them be responsible for the arrest.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes." Aristinas hesitated for a moment, then said: "Your Majesty, a secret report came from Iberia. Hasdrubal and a few members of the Magonid family often party together, drink heavily, and insult the kingdom... "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos didn't even frown and asked, "Are there any other suspicious circumstances?”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Not found yet.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's better to vent your dissatisfaction in person than to appear normal on the surface and have secret plans." Davos said disapprovingly: "Continue to observe."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "yes."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, "Bang! Bang! Bang!" There was a knock on the door.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Come in!” As soon as Davos finished speaking, Aristelas naturally retreated to the corner.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, Priest Plesinus asks to see you!” Henepolis walked in and said.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Ask him to come in.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Plesinas did not come alone. He was followed by two priests, each holding several wooden boards.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, the design selection for the mountaintop colossus has ended. We have brought the winner's work. Please make the final judgment and choose which design to cast the mountaintop statue."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The results came out so quickly?!" Davos became interested and immediately said: "Put them on the table and let's take a look at them one by one."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   From the corner of his eye, he caught a glimpse of Henepolis craning his neck to look this way. Davos waved to the left and right again and said, "You two should also come and take a look and give me some opinions."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hernepolis and Aristelas immediately came together.
  </font>
 </font>
