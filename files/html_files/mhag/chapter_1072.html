   Chapter 1072 Visiting Melses
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Sedorum, others also expressed their approval.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "In this case, after obtaining the consent of Haka and Hasdrubal, Lysias, you will submit the bill of adding a rotating president to the Senate for discussion and approval."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Your Majesty."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone secretly relaxed. tone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Alexis asked: "Your Majesty, your newly divided areas are not consistent with the troop source areas of each legion. Will this affect citizens' participation in military training and expeditions? Is it necessary? Adjust the source of troops of each legion?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I don't think it is necessary." Davos said simply: "The army is an army, and a region is a region. The two sides do not interfere with each other, but they must cooperate with each other, especially in the event of a war. At that time, various towns and regions must vigorously cooperate with the legionnaires in their expeditions and aftermath issues. This is a provision of the "Theonian Laws". I don't think any official at any level dares to obstruct or violate it!" After
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   answering Alek No one asked Sith's question for a while, so Davos continued: "Let me talk about some adjustments to the levels of the kingdom's officials after dividing the regions and adding the position of regional administrator."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone raised their eyebrows again. ear.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The rotating president is still the highest-ranking official in the kingdom, followed by the ministers of each department. The regional administrators are at the same level, but they must be elected by the Senate; the city administrators are at the same level as the junior officials of each department. This Intermediate officials will no longer be elected by the Senate, but directly decided by the Kingdom's Administrative Council..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty's decision is so right!" Hormone praised loudly: "There are now more than 100 large and small towns in the kingdom. , a city chief executive will arrive almost every 3 or 4 days, and the Senate is busy selecting successors every day, so there is no spare time to do other important things!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Others also felt this, Lysias, Cedorum and other senior members of the Senate thought more: since the kingdom's administrative meetings have been held frequently, many of the kingdom's internal affairs issues have been resolved here, and even many laws are discussed here first, and decisions are made before they are taken. Go to the Senate meeting to pass it.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the five rotating presidents and ministers from various departments are all important members of the Senate, it is easy for the proposal to be passed when they have reached an agreement. In this way, the affairs of the Senate have been reduced a lot. If it is further The matter of selecting chief executives of various towns has also been cancelled, and the role of the Senate has been greatly weakened!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lysias looked at Davos who was thinking about what to say, and thought a lot for a while.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Next is the Demo chief executive of each town, and then the village chief... This constitutes the most basic level 5 administrative officials in the kingdom. The levels of officials in other departments will be adjusted accordingly according to this standard. Oh, by the way ! The city chief executive of each district government should be half a rank higher than the ordinary city chief executive... Also, the powers of the district chief executive are not exactly the same as those of the wartime governor we previously appointed. He has the authority to manage the entire region. He has administrative power, but he does not have the power to use the army, nor the power to make local laws. However, although he does not appoint the chief executive of the city in the region, he can recommend the governors of Demo..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone thought deeply about Davos. Everything said, because it could very well be relevant to their future.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, Archibedes couldn't help but interjected: "Your Majesty, after the kingdom's territory is divided into regions and the chief administrators of each region are appointed, other officials must be assigned to them, right? This adds up to a lot of people, and the level If it's not low, it will be a big treasury expenditure."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This is inevitable." Davos comforted him and said: "The larger the kingdom's territory, the more problems it will have and the more difficulties it will encounter. Complex, this requires our governance to be more precise and efficient. Of course, we can discuss together what officials should be deployed. For

 <br/>

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   example, the original population of each town was small, and one or two clinics and hospitals could solve the people's disease problems, so Most towns do not have medical department officials, but now that regions have been established, whether it is to prevent and treat epidemics or to supervise the treatment of diseases in the entire region, medical department officials need to be set up to ensure the health of the people in the area.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Another example is to create Is it necessary to set up ministry officials in the region? Because each subordinate town has its own construction personnel. When the entire region needs to build a large public building, the local chief executive can gather the construction personnel from each subordinate town to carry out planning and construction. Build..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos and the ministers discussed the issue of the regional administrator until dusk, and finally came up with a clear and clear plan.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After everyone left, Davos stared at the big map and thought for a while before letting Hennipolis put the map back.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Henepolis returned to the palace hall, Davos said to him: "Henepolis, don't be in a hurry to go home. Come with me to visit Melses."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Your Majesty."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before the guards Under the escort, Davos left the palace. The passers-by he met along the way stopped to say hello to the king, and Davos responded with a smile.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Melses's mansion is not too far from the palace, just at the northern foot of the Celestial Hill. Compared with the mansions of other important ministers and senators, its appearance is very magnificent and conspicuous.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A tribune once reported him, claiming that he lived a luxurious life and suspected him of corruption, which caused a lot of trouble.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Ministry of Supervision also specially sent officials to conduct an investigation. It was found that not only did Melses not embezzle money from the treasury, but during the Western Mediterranean War, when the treasury was most stretched, he also used the money he earned from his business to purchase a batch of military supplies. , transported to the front line.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the news was announced, not only the people were in an uproar, but even the officials were surprised, which greatly changed their impression of the miser of the kingdom.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But what I didn't expect was that Melses began to fall ill a year after the war ended. After many active treatments, his condition recurred for more than two years. He finally fell completely ill at the beginning of this year and was unable to govern. Des succeeded him and took charge of the finance department.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Davos walked to the living room, Merses had already come out with the support of two slaves.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, his whole body was too bloated. Although he was covered by a wide white robe, you could still see his swollen legs and bloodshot ankles when he walked around. His face was also dark brown, and his energy was a little listless. , seeing Davos, his spirits were lifted a little. He tried his best to smile and said in a hoarse voice: "Your Majesty, you finally came to see me!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What a shame, Mercis, you are so forgetful! Last month. I just came to see you once!" Davos cursed softly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Visiting once a month is too long... It's best to come every two or three days..." Melses said shamelessly, urging the slave beside him: "Hurry up... help me to your majesty In front of you... It's easier to talk like this..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos hurriedly tried to dissuade him: "You're not in good health right now, so don't come out. Be careful of catching a cold! Let's go to your bedroom."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty..." Probably After walking for such a long time, Merses also felt powerless and did not persevere.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty!!" Melses's wife and three concubines also came over and respectfully saluted.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Davos returned the gift, he expressed his gratitude to them: "You have worked hard during this time!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What's so hard about it...I cry at every turn...I'm so annoyed that I want to drive them all out..." Mel Sith cursed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I see that you are recuperating at home, and your temper has grown a lot!" Davos said in a scolding tone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I'm stuck at home every day...I can't scold my colleagues...I can only scold my family..." Melcis was very calm.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You, you..." With Melis's rogue appearance, Davos shook his head repeatedly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When they arrived at the bedroom, the servant carefully helped Melcis lie down on the bed, and the big hardwood bed creaked under his pressure.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Davos saw that Mercis's feet were red, black, and shrunken. While he was shocked, he also felt a strong sadness, which reminded him of Helps not long ago. A pessimistic assessment of Melses' condition.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Melses covered his body with a quilt, he drove his wife and slaves out, leaving only Davos, Henepolis and Martius in the house.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then, Melses asked: "Your Majesty, you came to visit me today...is there anything important?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos motioned to Martius to close the door, and then said softly: " Let me tell you good news, but keep it a secret!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Merses saw Martius's actions and nodded solemnly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The kingdom is preparing to increase taxes on the people!" Davos said one word at a time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It should have been like this a long time ago!" Mersith perked up, and then thought of keeping it a secret, lowered his voice, and emphasized once again: "The kingdom should have increased taxes a long time ago!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos smiled and briefly He explained the reasons for the tax increase, and then asked seriously: "How much tax do you think should be increased to not only solve the military expenditure problem, but also ease the country's finances and make it affordable for the people?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course it is 10%. !" Melses replied without hesitation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Be more serious!" Davos' tone became stern.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mersith was stared at by Davos's majestic gaze and did not dare to say any more nonsense. He thought about it carefully, and then said with some reluctance: "I think... 5% may be more appropriate."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When it came to money. , Melses became energetic. Not only did he speak more fluently, but his thinking also became sharper. He explained in detail why he chose this tax rate. He is worthy of being the one who has held financial power since the establishment of Theonia. Man, Melses conducted a detailed analysis of all aspects of the kingdom, picking up all kinds of data at will.
