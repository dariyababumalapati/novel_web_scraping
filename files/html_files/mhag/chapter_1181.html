   Chapter 1181 Battle of Tegea (7)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the end, the Tegea soldiers could not even swing their spears, but the soldiers of the First Legion who were hiding behind the shield walls of the phalanx of each detachment were able to stab outwards freely. Drawing out their daggers, the continuous screams made the Tegean soldiers even more panicked. With their back roads cut off, they began to desperately rush into the Spartans, their allies in front.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ……………………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldiers kept using their long shields to resist external impacts, and kept stabbing outwards with their short swords. Their shoulders and arms were already sore. numb.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Max kept shouting and cheering, and his voice was almost hoarse... I don't know how long it took, but the enemy's attack on the turtle formation suddenly weakened.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Are our reinforcements really coming?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ...Max saw hope and felt happy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldiers peered out through the cracks in their shields and vaguely saw the Spartans retreating.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   They also relaxed temporarily and moved their sore and swollen arms slightly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, two loud sounds of "Peng! Peng!" came from above the head. The soldiers in the back row holding the long shields above their heads felt as if huge rocks were hitting the shields, and the entire arms holding the shields were almost broken. When it broke off, they couldn't help but scream in pain.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, two figures fell from above, and before the Theonian Legion soldiers could react, they pushed the soldiers around them outward.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Theonian soldiers were guarding against the enemy's attack from outside. They did not expect that the turtle shell array would be breached from the inside, and several soldiers were pushed out of the array without any precautions.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Max's eyes were splitting, and he shouted: "Tighten the formation!" while he rushed towards the enemy closest to him, and the dagger pierced the enemy's throat. However, the ferocious smile of the enemy before death made his heart freeze.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   They were already prepared for the Spartans to swarm from all directions, leaving Max's detachment of soldiers with no time to regroup before they were knocked to pieces and had to fight on their own.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It turned out that after the Spartan warriors rushed into the dispersed formation of Theonia, they found that the Theonia were not scattered. They gathered into strange small square formations and were resisting tenaciously.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Spartans continued to attack, but were still unable to break through the opponent's defense. Instead, many people were injured.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Spartans, who had strong tactical ability, had to find another way to defeat the enemy. Soon they thought: the defenses around these small Theonian phalanxes were very strong, but there might be a breakthrough above them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So two volunteers who volunteered jumped on top of the turtle shell formation and smashed open the entire formation under the support of many comrades.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Facing the overwhelming number of Spartan warriors, the resistance of the detachment soldiers was quickly crushed. Max, who was pierced through the thigh and fell to the ground, did not stop fighting. He protected his upper body with a long shield and slashed the enemy with a short sword. It was not until a spear pierced his right hand that the dagger, which had been cut full of gaps, finally slipped from his hands... The

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Spartan warriors used the same method to destroy several of the soldiers at the front. In the small Theonian phalanx, just when they were preparing to continue their efforts, the warriors at the front were pushed desperately by the frightened Tegeans. Not only were they unable to continue attacking the Theonian phalanx, but they were also in danger. After being unable to scold the frightened Tegeans, they stabbed their former allies with their spears, and the situation began to become chaotic.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then, not long after, commotion began in the rear of the Spartan army.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The forced march speed of the Theonian light armored soldiers was naturally faster than that of the heavy infantry. After the three legion light armored soldiers quickly bypassed the left wing of the entire military formation, without making any modifications, they immediately launched an attack on the flank of the Spartan army. The ferocious attack hit the Spartan army's weak spot.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Among the 7,000 soldiers sent from Spartan territory this time, there were only about 1,500 real Spartan warriors, more than 1,000 elderly Spartan citizens, nearly 2,000 Piliasians, and more than 2,000 Helots.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to ensure that Agesilaus' plan could be executed smoothly, Archidamus ranked the Spartans at the forefront, followed by the Piliasians, and then the old Spartans and Helots. the mix of.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the beginning of the battle, the mixed troops of old Spartans and Helots did not enter the battle, but kept a certain distance from the fighting troops, because Agesilaus was worried that these troops had never accepted a false defeat. Tactically trained helots would be a hindrance.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Only after the Spartan warriors returned to fight again, the old Spartan warriors led the Helots to rush behind to increase the intensity and thickness of the attack, thus defeating Theonia's left wing in one fell swoop.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But the reality is that Theonia's left wing has not been defeated, and the Helots are still following closely behind the entire Spartan team. As a result, they become the target of the attack by the Theonia light armor brigade.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the Council of Elders had made a promise to the helots who participated in the war: after the war was won, they would become free citizens of Sparta.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the Helots, who vaguely knew that the Spartans were now in a difficult situation, were not very enthusiastic about it. However, out of fear of the Spartans, they pretended to be more obedient and hard-working, but in the face of Dionis Under the ferocious attack of the sub-soldiers, these Helots, who had no armor protection, only wore single clothes, and held a simple spear, began to retreat within a moment of fighting, and also took down some old Spartan warriors who were still fighting. .

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ……………………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus expected news of victory from the right wing, but the guards sent out several times received the same news: the right wing The Spartans are still fighting.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus felt that he already knew the Theonian army very well, but he never expected that the Theonian soldiers would be affected by Sparta's false defeat tactics and then be attacked fiercely from both sides. To be able to keep fighting for so long!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While he was astonished by the tenacity of the Theonian soldiers' fighting spirit, he also regretted that he had only collected information through oral rumors, or that he did not have a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the Theonian army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now he has begun to stand uneasy, because he knows that if the Theonian left wing cannot be defeated quickly, the weaknesses of the Spartan coalition will be exposed over time, mainly the Tegea army, because the Theonian army is Reserves are always kept during battles, and they will inevitably send reserves to attack the Tegeans in order to rescue the left wing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, Agesilaus quickly sent messengers to stop the Thracians who were rushing south, preparing to let them rush north, bypass the Spartan army, and reinforce the Tegeans.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, just as the thousands of Thracian peltasts ran past his rear, the guards who were inquiring about the news hurried back and shouted: "King Agesilaus, it's not good! Our flank is under attack. Theonian attack!!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus was shocked. He had always thought that the commander of Theonia would first send a reserve team to attack the Tegeans closest to them at this time, so as to achieve the purpose of rescuing the left wing, but at this time Theonia The army actually bypassed the left wing and attacked the flank of the Spartan army. If the Theonian commander was not dizzy, it can only explain one problem. The Theonians have a considerable number of reserves and can attack both ends at the same time. Attack.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus was still laughing secretly at the young commander of Theonia for his lack of experience and easily falling into the trap. Now he had to marvel at the other party's boldness.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the situation was very critical and he did not allow him to think too much. He immediately issued an order: "Hurry up and notify the Thracians, let them rush to the right wing quickly, repel the Theonian attack, and protect the flanks of the Spartan army." !"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Thracian team was not far from Agesilaus, and the order was quickly conveyed.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, these Thracians who came from the north of the Macedonian territory and did not know much about the reputation of Agesilaus had always been known for their bravery and bad temper. They had accepted the order and marched south in a hurry, and they were almost reaching their destination. , but was called back urgently to execute another order.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Running back and forth in vain has made them suffocate in their hearts. Now the order has changed again. Although it is still in the same direction and the distance is closer, the Thracians finally can't help cursing and complaining, and even their curses The sound reached the ears of Agesilaus: "Does that lame old Spartan know how to command? He gave orders indiscriminately and got dizzy!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I don't think the Spartans can do it anymore. He
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   actually sent a dying old man to be the commander!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Let's just finish this battle, get the commission, and leave as soon as possible. I don't want to be angry anymore!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 ---
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If Agesilaus listens to this in normal times, He had long been furious when he heard these words that violated his taboo, but now he could only endure it, and hoped that these Thracians would speed up after they relieved themselves.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Finally seeing the Thracians disappear from his sight, the worry in his heart not only did not disappear, but actually increased.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, he no longer had any hope of winning this battle. He only hoped to fight a draw with the Theonian army, and the casualties of the Spartan soldiers were not large. He had decided to change his next battle. Plan: When this battle is over, he will immediately disband the mercenaries, bring the Spartan warriors back to the territory as soon as possible, defend the Theonian attack for as long as possible, protect the security of the Spartan territory, and wait for the situation. The change.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, at this moment, guards rushed from the south: "Nearly a thousand Theonian soldiers appeared behind the right wing, and they launched an attack on the mercenary's flank!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing this, Agsilao If he was hit hard, his whole body would instantly become cold.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The guard next to him saw Agesilaus standing blankly like a clay sculpture, and immediately asked with concern: "King Agesilaus, are you okay?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
