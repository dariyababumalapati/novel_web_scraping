   Although the Greeks in the city-state of Elis did not know the destination of this large-scale fleet, they were familiar with the symbol of "black hair entwined with double forks" on the sails. However, in the past, they were all on the way to trade. What I saw on the Onian merchant ship now appears on the warship. Does this mean that the barbarian kingdom on the other side of the Adriatic Sea is finally going to launch an attack on the Greek mainland?

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   No matter how fearful and suspicious the Greek people are, Dio The Nia fleet headed straight south without slowing down, and soon crossed the entrance to the Gulf of Corinth and entered the waters on the west coast of the Peloponnese Peninsula. As dusk approached, the fleet had to land early to prepare for camping. . This is because the southern coast of Messenia cannot be reached today, and there are steep and narrow coasts further south. It is difficult for ships to dock, and the crew cannot get a rest.

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, where the entire fleet docked ,

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The northwest corner of the Peloponnese Peninsula, where the terrain is relatively flat, has been called the Elis region since ancient times. It is very famous throughout the Greek world because the Olympian Games were held here and there is also the famous The Temple of Zeus, of course, also has two well-known city-states, Ellis and Pisa. They have always been sworn enemies in competing for the right to host the Olympian Games.

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The location where the Theonians landed happened to be within the territory of Ellis Inside, they saw densely packed ships swarming towards the coast and thousands of soldiers rushing onto the beach. The neighboring Greek people were frightened and ran inland with their families.

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The people of Ellis City quickly received the news. They are also very panic: although they have little contact with the Theonians, they have never provoked this behemoth in the west. There is no sign. Why did the Theonians send troops to invade their territory?!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Council meeting While conducting emergency military mobilization and emergency consultations with the citizens in the territory, they finally came to a conclusion: It is said that the Theonians believe in Hades and do not recognize Zeus as the king of gods. Is this time to destroy Zeus? Coming from the temple?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The members of Elis discovered sadly: If this is really the case, in order to defend the protector God Zeus, the Elis people will have to fight to the death.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just when the Elis people feel that the future is pessimistic , they received an urgent notice from the city guard: the Theonian envoy was visiting.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tisias, a Theonian citizen, a Tyndares man, and a Tyndares general who had served for several consecutive terms, in Tyndaris He had a high prestige among the people of Sri Lanka. Later, he responded to the people's demands and convened and presided over the citizens' meeting, which eventually led to the smooth integration of Tyndares into the Kingdom of Theonia, and he became the patriarch of the kingdom.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When "Davos approved Theonian" After the news of the "Nian army attacking the Peloponnese and rebuilding Messenia" reached the Senate, he took the initiative to see King Davos, hoping to follow the army because his ancestral home was Messenia... ...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Tisias walked to the center of the Elis Council meeting room with his head held high, looking at the angry but frightened eyes, he felt a sense of pride in his heart as a citizen of a big country, but He suppressed this pride and tried to make his expression sincere: "Descendants of Zeus, respected citizens of Ellis, on behalf of the Kingdom of Theonia, I would like to express my most sincere apology to you!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   During the voyage, because it was getting late, our fleet had to temporarily dock to rest in order to prevent accidents, so it entered your territory. But please don't worry, we will only rest for one night and leave tomorrow. We will not do anything to you. Any harm caused to this land and the people on it, and based on the inconvenience caused to you by our reckless behavior, we Theonia will also pay a certain amount of gold and silver as the army's overnight expenses on this night to compensate love. Lis..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tisias's words made the members of Ellis feel doubtful, but their hearts finally dropped. There was a
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   commotion in the venue, and the members discussed in whispers for a while. Someone stood up and asked: "Theonians, your reckless actions have indeed caused a lot of trouble to Ellis, but if things are as you said, we are still willing to forgive your reckless actions. ..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ellis is not an easy city-state to talk to, let alone its decades-long conflict with Pisa, and during these decades it has had several wars with the Spartans, but Ellis The reason why the congressmen became so reasonable at this moment is just because the Theonians came so suddenly and the army was so large that they felt that they were unable to defeat them, so they wanted to send this plague away as soon as possible.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then, there were The congressman asked curiously: "I wonder where your army is going?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tisias
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   was waiting for this question, and he immediately asked: "Have you heard of the city of Tyndares in Sicily?"
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tyndarius... was probably a city-state established on the northeastern corner of Sicily with the support of Dionysius, the original tyrant of Syracuse. It is said that more than half of its citizens are from Messenia. Later, Tyndareus defected to Theonia..." said a councilor.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It was not a defection, but the citizens of Tyndareus collectively decided to join Theonia!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Tisias corrected him loudly, and then said: "When the Tyndares people joined the Holy Kingdom of Theonia, King Davos once made a promise, 'One day he will help Messenae. Asia gained independence and freed the Messenians who had become slaves'... But shortly after that, due to the impact of the war, Theonia and Sparta signed a long-term peace agreement, and this commitment was temporarily shelved , until this year the Spartans tore up the peace agreement with our Theonia-"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tisias showed a gloating smile on his face and said loudly: "King Davos finally has a chance to fulfill his promise, so The Theonian army you see is heading to the Messenian region to drive away the Spartans who have occupied it for hundreds of years and make Messenia the home of the Messenians again!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the end of the sentence, Tisias's mood became intense, as if a flame was suddenly ignited in the venue, which shocked and excited all the Eles people present: This news is so amazing! The Western Mediterranean Overlord Theonia has declared war on Sparta!!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Why are the Ailes so excited? Isn't it also a member of the Peloponnesian League?!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ailes is indeed a member of the Peloponnesian League One of them, but since the Spartan king Agis (father of Leoticides) led his army into the territory of Elis, defeated it, forced it to surrender, and even took part of its territory as its own, The Eleans gradually drifted away from Sparta. In subsequent military operations led by Sparta, the Eleans contributed very little. In order to punish it for its disobedience, the Spartans even moved the Olympian Games to The right to host the event was given to Ellis's mortal enemy, Pisa.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the Peloponnesian League, Elis was gradually being marginalized.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What worries the Ellis people even more is that in the Spartan Armistice Conference they participated in not long ago, in addition to Thebes, Ellis was the second city-state that did not sign the contract, because according to the contract, each city-state They must be independent, and it is impossible for the Alice people to allow the several towns they control to gain independence. Therefore, Alice also refused to participate in the previous oath-taking action held in Athens. In this way, Alice The western part of the Nyssa Peninsula seems too isolated.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, after the Arcadians had a stalemate with Sparta over the establishment of an alliance during this period, the Eleans were overjoyed. They even sent envoys to Megalopolis a few days ago to prepare for the attack on Acres. The Dia people expressed support, and now the Kingdom of Theonia's declaration of war on Sparta is undoubtedly another shot in the arm for them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In this boiling noise, someone suddenly shouted: "Dear Theonian envoy, you just said that the Theonian Kingdom will let the Messenians rebuild their homeland. The Messenians you said What are you referring to?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tisias looked closely and saw that the speaker was the one who had previously answered Tyndares's origin. He probably had a clue in his mind, and he said loudly: "All the people who were enslaved by the Spartans and lived in Messe Messenian slaves in Ninia and Laconia, all Messenians who were forced to live in other city-states, and their descendants will be regarded by our Holy Kingdom of Theonia as the Messenians to be established. Citizens of the city-state of Theonia, Theonia welcomes them back to the homeland where their ancestors lived and rebuild a home that truly belongs to them!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, I am a Messenian, and this time I will witness Theonia with my own eyes. The Nian army will drive away the Spartan bandits who have invaded our homeland for hundreds of years, and will personally liberate those compatriots who became Helots, allowing them to regain their dignity and freedom, and let the land of Messenia be in the true Messenia Life is renewed in human hands!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After listening to Tisias's words, the MP's eyes suddenly turned red, and he couldn't help but opened his mouth to sing: "Under the towering and steep Taygetos Mountain, the clear and gentle Parmisus River flows, The majestic Etom boulder protects the beautiful city of Messenae, countless cattle and sheep are running on the plains with fertile water and grass, and countless farmers are working in the fields..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tisias was stunned, and then sang along: "...the Spartans, like vicious wolves, have usurped our land and enslaved us like cattle and sheep. We are still unable to endure the heavy burdens we carry. Their cruel whips keep beating, and the hard work of cultivating the land harvests Most of the fruits belong to these ferocious robbers..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, several more Ellis members joined in, singing passionately: "... Gods of Olympus, if you are willing Bless Messenia, I am willing to sacrifice my daughter like the hero Aristodemus, and then fight to the death;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Gods of Olympus, please send down your blessing, I will be like Aristotle Like Menes, I have been fighting non-stop throughout my life. As long as the people can be saved, I am willing to go through hardships, be covered with bruises, and have nothing..." At the
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   end of the song, the voices of seven or eight people actually overwhelmed the noise of the venue. At this moment, everyone Tears were streaming down his face.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the fall of Messenia, this ballad composed by an unknown person has been quietly sung among the enslaved Messenian people, and it has also been remembered by the Messenians who fled their homeland and were scattered across the Mediterranean. the sufferings experienced by our ancestors.
