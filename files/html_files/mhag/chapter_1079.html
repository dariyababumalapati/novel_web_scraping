   Chapter 1079 Street Tavern
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, in the traditional concept of the Greeks, it is not the priesthood of Hades to be in charge of rivers and springs, but since he performed miracles in Turi Spring and brought him back to life, Dionis The demi-humans gradually believed that Hades was the real protector of springs and drinking water, and Poseidon instead became a support.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, there were several women carrying multiple earthen jars by the pool, chatting and drinking water.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The children were chasing and playing around the pool and the surrounding stone pillars.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Asimus's two children were eager to join in, but Fulvia stopped them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Maximus was surprised and confused as to how the water in the pool came out, he did not ask. Instead, he followed the slave, climbed the stairs to the third floor, and walked along the somewhat dark corridor to the fortress. Rooms for rent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I met several tenants along the way, and they all greeted the servant humbly. Apparently, the landlord usually asked this servant to take care of the entire rental building.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the room was simple, with only a bed, a table, and a few chairs, it was clean, spacious, and had good lighting. It was much better than the house he lived in in the slave camp, so Maxim immediately decided to rent it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After placing the package in the room, he followed the slave to the tax office and signed a rental agreement.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Finally, the rental matter was settled. It was already dusk. Maximus and his wife felt a little hungry, and the two children lost the energy to play, so Maximus decided to take the whole family to eat something. ,Fill the stomach.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There were many restaurants near the place where they rented, among which Christoya's Restaurant was the most famous. It was fully booked early and there were people lining up outside the door.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But considering the price issue, Maximus finally chose to eat at a cheaper street pub.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This kind of street-facing pub usually only has a circular counter. There are multiple circular pits in the stone counter. Open wine cans, beer cans and clay pots are embedded in these pits. They are also inlaid on the stone wall at the end of the counter. There is a shrine, but usually it is not Hades, but Dionysus, the Greek god of wine.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the Maximus family walked into the street tavern, there were already some diners inside, making the small store seem a bit crowded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The cook in the center of the counter saw them, and immediately looked over with a smile and asked, "What would you like to eat and drink?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Is there anything that can fill your stomach?" Maximus looked at the bottles on the counter. Bo Jing Jing asked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Bread, cheese, vegetables, nuts and olives... can be provided to you right away. Of course, if you need some hot soup, we can also cook haggis soup and beef soup, wheat porridge and Bean porridge, but this will take some time." The cook looked at the Maximus family, estimated their needs, and said fluently: "Of course, the most important thing here is that we can provide you with all kinds of products produced in the kingdom. Wine and beer, and the price is relatively cheap."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Bring me four pieces of bread, four slices of cheese, two bowls of wheat porridge, and a large bowl of haggis soup." Maximus thought for a while and said.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Don't you drink some wine?" The cook tried her best to persuade: "It seems that you have walked a long way. You must be tired and thirsty. Why not drink a glass of beer to moisten your throat and relieve your fatigue."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mark Sims was not someone who could be easily persuaded, but when he saw the diners holding wine glasses and talking loudly at the counter, he suddenly changed his mind: "Bring me a beer." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Which kind of beer do you want to drink?" ?" The cook pointed to a round pit on the counter in front of her and said enthusiastically: "I recommend Kristoya beer to you. This is made by the brewery of Princess Kristoya. It was they who invented it. Theonia's beer, so their beer is the most authentic, delicious, and very refreshing. It is very popular with the people of the kingdom. Because of the high demand, most of the output is purchased by those damn wealthy businessmen and officials. Storage, used for banquets and entertaining guests, there are not many on the market. Our tavern got some because of a special relationship. Although the price is a little more expensive, it is very rare."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Maximus was told by her He was a little moved, but still suppressed his desire to speak and said, "Just give me a glass of ordinary beer."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the cook failed to persuade her, she did not show her frustration and said to him with a smile: "Okay. Then one Bread is 5 Obols, and four loaves is 20 Obols... a total of 67 Obols, which is converted into 9 drachmas and three Obols. You pay the money first, and I will give it to you right away. You prepare the food."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Well, the price of this dinner is close to one month's rent!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the past, Maximus wouldn't have cared about this small amount of money, but more than three years of slave life made him deeply aware of the hardships of life. He took a breath, counted 10 drachmas from the money bag, and retrieved 4 opoles.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The cook looked at the crowd, and then shouted loudly: "Hey! There are children who want to eat, please give up your seat!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   She shouted in a high-pitched voice, and someone actually came from the bench against the wall. Standing up, Fulvia quickly squeezed through with her children, thanked the diners, and then sat down.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus stood at the counter.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a while, the cook put all the bread and cheese he ordered into a small wooden basket and handed it over.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus felt that the bread was still hot, and couldn't help but secretly nodded at the tavern's attentiveness.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The cook opened a wooden lid, reached into the clay pot in the stone pit with a slender wooden spoon, scooped up the beer, poured a full glass, and handed it to Maximus. As for the wheat porridge and mutton soup, there were still some. It takes time to cook.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus took the beer and took a sip first, feeling that his dry throat was moisturized immediately.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, there was no beer in Rome before. Maximus started to like drinking this cheap and soothing drink in the slave camp.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The family sat in the corner and began to eat. Maximus was chewing bread while listening carefully to the conversations of the diners.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Hey, have you heard about it? It is said that the kingdom is preparing to send troops to build fortress defenses on the southern border of Iberia and northern Etrunia. It is said that it may be cancelled!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You are wrong, cancellation is impossible , if the kingdom does not send troops to the border for defense, then the plundering of the barbarians in the mountainous areas will not be stopped, and they will only become stronger and more violent, and maybe they will also attack the kingdom. launch an attack on the border territories."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Wouldn't that just allow the kingdom to launch a war to eliminate these barbarians? Maybe we can also get some military exploits and become citizens as soon as possible." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I heard that the kingdom is not planning to launch a big war in the past few years, because the last war It has only been a few years, and the consumption has been too great, and it has not recovered yet."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You are right. But it is not only for this reason. It is said that whether it is northern Etruria or southern Iberia, there are continuous The mountains, and the terrain is dangerous, most of the indigenous tribes live in the mountains. Once they cannot defeat the kingdom's army, they are likely to hide in the mountains. It will be very difficult for the kingdom to completely eliminate and conquer them, so It is necessary to first send troops to defend the border and severely crack down on the invading barbarians. However, I heard that due to the strong opposition from the people, the decision to send legions to defend may be canceled and free people will be hired to form border defenses instead. Army."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The diners exclaimed: "Is this true?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus was moved in his heart and took a closer look: Most of the diners were wearing simple linen shirts and looked shabby. They were obviously of lower status. They only had There were a few who were more well-dressed, and this man who seemed to have a lot of inside information was one of them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He took a sip of beer and said proudly: Of course this is true. When did I, Gorgeon, deceive you?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Let me tell you, this matter has been discussed above, and the reason why it has never been decided is because it costs a lot of money to hire an army, and the kingdom cannot afford more money to support an army dedicated to guarding the border. mercenary army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But I heard from a good friend who is a palace guard that His Majesty King Davos once said very firmly in a meeting that the kingdom's border troops must be established as soon as possible!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because the territory of the kingdom is constantly expanding, it now takes ten days or half a month to lead an army from Thurii to the border. It may take two, three months or even half a year in the future.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Once a foreign enemy invades and mobilizes the army to meet the enemy, I am afraid that the enemy has captured the border area and killed countless people in the kingdom. Therefore, a border defense army must be formed to guard the security of the kingdom's border. If there is really no money to form a mercenary army , then he will send troops to guard the border for a long time regardless of the opposition of the people!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   His Majesty the great King Davos is sincerely thinking about the kingdom, but those Theonia citizens seem too selfish!"
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Another diner sighed: "If I had become an official citizen, I would definitely fully support His Majesty's decision and guard the border as a legionnaire without hesitation!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "cut!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Another diner said disdainfully: "As a registered free citizen, if the kingdom decides to establish a mercenary army composed of free people, I will definitely join without hesitation, and I will not ask for a salary from Obol. , as long as I become an official citizen of Theonia immediately.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A few diners also responded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "If you become a formal citizen and get a land allotment, you will definitely regret it.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Someone suddenly said something, which immediately caused a burst of laughter.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The Kingdom of Theonia has a vast territory and a large population. Why does it have no money to support a small mercenary army?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Another diner asked in confusion.
  </font>
