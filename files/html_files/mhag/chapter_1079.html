   Chapter 1079 Street Tavern
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, in the traditional concept of the Greeks, it is not Hades's priesthood to be in charge of rivers and springs. However, since he performed miracles in Tuli Spring and brought him back to life, the Theonians gradually believed that Hades He was the real protector of springs and drinking water, and Poseidon became a supporter.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, there were several women carrying multiple earthen jars by the pool, chatting and drinking water. The children were chasing and playing around the pool and the surrounding stone pillars.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Asimus's two children were eager to try and join in, but Fulvia stopped them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Maximus was surprised and confused as to how the water in the pool came out, he did not ask. Instead, he followed the slave, climbed the stairs to the third floor, and walked along the somewhat dark corridor to the fortress. Rooms for rent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I met several tenants along the way, and they all greeted the servant humbly. Apparently, the landlord usually asked this servant to take care of the entire rental building.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the room was simple, with only a bed, a table, and a few chairs, it was clean, spacious, and had good lighting. It was much better than the house he lived in in the slave camp, so Maxim immediately decided to rent it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After placing the package in the room, he went to the tax office with the slave and signed a rental agreement.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Finally, the rental matter was settled. It was already dusk. Maximus and his wife felt a little hungry, and the two children lost the energy to play, so Maximus decided to take the whole family to eat something. ,Fill the stomach.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There are many restaurants near the place where they rented, among which Christoya's Restaurant is the most famous. It is full of customers early and there are people lining up outside the door.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, considering the price issue, Maximus finally chose to eat at a cheaper street pub.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This kind of street-facing pub usually only has a circular counter. There are multiple circular pits in the stone counter. Open wine cans, beer cans and clay pots are embedded in these pits. They are also inlaid on the stone wall at the end of the counter. There is a shrine, but usually it is not Hades, but Dionysus, the Greek god of wine.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the Maximus family walked into the street tavern, there were already some diners inside, making the small store seem a bit crowded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The cook in the middle of the counter saw them, and immediately looked over with a smile and asked: "What do you want to eat and drink?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Is there anything I can fill my stomach with?” Maximus asked, looking at the bottles and cans on the counter.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Bread, cheese, vegetables, nuts and olives... can be provided to you right away. Of course, if you need some hot soup, we can also cook haggis soup and beef soup, wheat porridge and Bean porridge, but this will take some time." The cook looked at the Maximus family, estimated their needs, and said fluently: "Of course, the most important thing here is that we can provide you with all kinds of products produced in the kingdom. Wine and beer, and relatively cheap.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Bring me four pieces of bread, four slices of cheese, two bowls of porridge, and a large bowl of haggis soup." Maximus thought for a while and said.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Don't you drink some wine?” The cook tried her best to persuade: "It seems that you have walked a long way. You must be tired and thirsty. Why not drink a glass of beer to moisten your throat and relieve your fatigue.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus was not someone who could be easily persuaded, but when he saw the diners holding wine glasses and talking loudly at the counter, he suddenly changed his mind: "Bring me a beer."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Which beer do you want to drink?" The cook pointed to a round pit on the counter in front of her and said enthusiastically: "I recommend Kristoya Beer to you. This is a brewery run by Princess Kristoya. It was they who invented Theonia's beer, so their beer is the most authentic, best-tasting, and very refreshing. It is very popular with the people of the kingdom. Because of the high demand, most of the output is Those damn rich businessmen and officials bought and stored them for banquets and entertaining guests, but there are not many on the market. Our tavern got some because of a special relationship. Although the price is a little more expensive, it is very rare."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even though Maximus was a little moved by what she said, he still suppressed his desire to speak and said, "Just give me a glass of ordinary beer."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the cook's persuasion failed, she did not show any frustration and said to him with a smile: "Okay. Then one loaf of bread is 5 opors, four loaves is 20 opos... a total of 67 opos. Well, it's converted into nine drachmas and three opors. You pay the money first, and I'll prepare food for you right away.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Well, the price of this dinner is close to one month's rent! In the past, Maximus wouldn't have cared about this small amount of money, but more than three years of slave life made him deeply aware of the hardships of life. He took a breath, counted 10 drachmas from the money bag, and retrieved 4 opoles.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The cook looked at the crowd, and then shouted loudly: "Hey! There are children who want to eat, please take the initiative to give up your seat!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as her shrill voice shouted, someone actually stood up from the bench against the wall. Fulvia quickly squeezed past with her children, thanked the diners, and then sat down.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus stood at the counter.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a while, the cook put the bread and cheese he ordered into a small wooden basket and handed them over.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus felt that the bread was still hot and couldn't help but secretly nodded at the tavern's attentiveness.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The cook opened a wooden lid, reached into the clay pot in the stone pit with a slender wooden spoon, scooped up the beer, poured a full glass, and handed it to Maximus. As for the wheat porridge and mutton soup, there were still some. It takes time to cook.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus took the beer and took a sip first, feeling that his dry throat was moisturized immediately. In fact, there was no beer in Rome before. Maximus started to like drinking this cheap and soothing drink in the slave camp.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The family sat in the corner and began to eat. Maximos was chewing bread while listening carefully to the conversations of the diners.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Hey, have you heard? It is said that the "Kingdom is preparing to send troops to build fortress defenses on the border of southern Iberia and northern Etrunia" may be cancelled!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You are wrong. It is impossible to cancel. If the kingdom does not send troops to the border for defense, then the plundering of the barbarians in the mountains will not be stopped, and they will only become stronger and stronger. It is becoming more and more aggressive, and may even launch an attack on the kingdom's border territories.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Then let the kingdom launch a war to eliminate these barbarians. Maybe we can also get some military exploits and become citizens as soon as possible.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I heard that the kingdom is not preparing to launch a major war in the past few years, because the last war has only been a few years ago, and the consumption was too great, and it has not recovered yet.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You are right. But it is not just for this reason. It is said that both northern Etruria and southern Iberia are full of rolling mountains, and the terrain is dangerous. Most of the indigenous tribes live in the mountains. , once they cannot defeat the kingdom's army, they are likely to hide in the mountains. It will be very difficult for the kingdom to completely eliminate and conquer them, so it is necessary to send troops to defend the border first and severely attack the invading barbarians. , but I heard that because of the strong opposition from the people, the decision to send legions for defense may be canceled and instead, free people will be hired to form a border defense army."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The diners exclaimed: "Is this true?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus's heart moved and he took a closer look: Most of the diners were wearing simple linen shirts and looked shabby. They were obviously of lower status. Only a few were more well-dressed. This person who seemed to know a lot of inside information was one of them. one.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He took a sip of beer and said proudly: Of course this is true. When did I, Gorgeon, deceive you? Let me tell you, this matter has been discussed above, and the reason why it has never been decided is because it costs a lot of money to hire an army, and the kingdom cannot afford more money to support an army dedicated to guarding the border. mercenary army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But I heard from a good friend who is a palace guard that His Majesty King Davos once said very firmly in the meeting that the kingdom's border troops must be established as soon as possible! Because the territory of the kingdom is constantly expanding, it now takes ten days or half a month to lead an army from Thurii to the border. It may take two, three months or even half a year in the future. Once a foreign enemy invades and mobilizes the army to meet the enemy, I am afraid that the enemy has captured the border area and killed countless people in the kingdom. Therefore, a border defense army must be formed to guard the security of the kingdom's border. If there is really no money to form a mercenary army , then he will send troops to guard the border for a long time regardless of the opposition of the people! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "His Majesty the great King Davos is sincerely thinking about the kingdom, but those Theonia citizens seem too selfish!" Another diner sighed: "If I had become an official citizen, I would definitely do my best. I support His Majesty's decision and will guard the border as a legionnaire without hesitation!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Tch!" Another diner said disdainfully: "As a registered free citizen, if the kingdom decides to establish a mercenary army composed of free people, I will definitely join without hesitation, and I don't want an Obo. As long as I become an official citizen of Theonia immediately with your salary."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Several diners also responded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "If you become a formal citizen and get a land allotment, you will definitely regret it." Someone said suddenly, which immediately caused a burst of laughter.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The Kingdom of Theonia has a vast territory and a large population. Why does it have no money to support a small mercenary army?” Another diner asked in confusion.
  </font>
