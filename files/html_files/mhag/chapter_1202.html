   Chapter 1202 Governor of Phrygia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reason why this admiral who was expelled by the Athenian people was reused in Phrygia was not only because of his talent in naval warfare, but also because he was the son of Ariobazenis, the governor of Phrygia. Friends.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   How could a down-and-out Athenian become friends with a respected Persian governor?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reason goes back decades ago. After the Peloponnesian War, Konon, the famous Athenian naval admiral, fled to Persia and settled down under the courtesy of Cyrus the Younger, the military commander of western Asia Minor at the time. He had close contacts with the Persian nobles, which laid the foundation for him to later serve as commander of the Persian fleet in Asia Minor.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And his son Timotheus also made friends with many young Persian nobles because he lived in western Asia Minor for many years, and Ariobazenis was one of them.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Timotheus returned to Athens, the two parties were still in constant contact. This time he was driven out of Athens, and his first thought was to seek refuge with his friend who had become the governor.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ario Barzenis was happy for the arrival of his friend. He also knew his friend's abilities very well, and he was very bold in promoting him to fleet commander after only half a year.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Today, Ariobazenis sent someone to inform Timothy that he had something important to discuss with him.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the messenger did not tell Timothy what important matter it was, he had a premonition that the matter he had been requesting might have a result, so he rode a horse to the Phrygian Governor's Palace with some anxiety.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The residence of Ariobazenis was in the central town of Phrygia - Gerdium on the right bank of the Sakarya River. Timotheus broke three horses and finally arrived there at dusk on the fifth day.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ariobazenis, who had been notified by the messenger, went out to greet him in person, and said seriously: "Timotheus, I am so sorry! I have just punished the messenger who brought you severely. He did not fully understand my order. I didn't explain it clearly to you. In fact, the matter was not urgent, but it ended up making you rush all the way with almost no rest. If something happened to you on the road, I would be very guilty and uneasy. Fortunately, God Mazda protects you. !"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Timothy was a little touched by Aliobazenis's concern. He hurriedly saluted and said: "Your Majesty the Governor..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ariobazenis immediately interrupted him with an unhappy expression: "Hey, how many people are there? The moon is gone, and the way you call me has changed! You are my friend first, and then temporarily my subordinate. I hope this friendship can last for a long time, so you'd better call me the same as before." For
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   no. For an Athenian who likes to be groveling, this was exactly what Timothy wanted. He immediately changed his mind: "Alio, I wonder why you called me here this time?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Aliobazenis laughed and stopped. With his arms, he welcomed him into the mansion and said at the same time: "Although the messenger made a mistake, I am very happy to see you so soon! You must be tired and hungry after coming all the way. Let's take a bath first and then have a meal together. , let's chat while eating."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   With the service of the maid, Timothy finished his bath, and during the meal, he briefly talked to Ariobazenis about some of the circumstances of his taking over the Phrygian fleet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After listening carefully, Aliobazenis expressed satisfaction with Timothy's actions in Aspendus, and then turned to mention some interesting things about the two people's interactions when they were young.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Timothy also interrupted from time to time. Although he was the only two other people in the restaurant besides five or six maids, the whole atmosphere seemed quite lively.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After three rounds of wine and five dishes, Ariobazenis said seriously: "Timotheus, you told me last time that you hoped to lead a fleet to support Athens and fight against the Theonian navy. Fighting... I can't promise you this."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Timothy heard this, he felt disappointed. Although he did not show this emotion, he remained silent for a moment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ariobazenis saw this, and calmly took out a letter from his arms, handed it to him and said, "Look at this first."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Timothy took the letter puzzled and unfolded it. , his expression soon changed: "The King of Persia wants to attack Egypt and asks you to provide troops and supplies, and also named me to lead the fleet to Tire?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Aliobazenis sighed: "You made this request to me before The reason why I have been hesitant is not because I am stingy, but because the Persian king is planning to attack Egypt. If I agree to your request at this time and send the fleet to Athens, the king will know about it. , with his suspicious and vindictive temperament, I am afraid that I am unwilling to provide him with military support and deliberately made such an excuse in advance. I am afraid that he will not make it easier for me in the future...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alas! Since His Highness Cyrus failed that year After that, the great king had a very opinion of our Asia Minor... Not only did he not provide help when Sparta invaded our land, but in the end he supported Sparta's rule over Greece... Several wars occurred in the country after that, Which time did we Asia Minor contribute the most, and of course suffered the most..." When
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Timothy heard these words, not only did his dissatisfaction disappear, but he also felt guilty. He said sincerely: "Ario, I was expelled from Athens. You not only took me in, but also entrusted me with important tasks. I am very grateful! I should not have made such a request to embarrass you. This is my fault!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ariobazenis shook his head and said helplessly: "Athens expelled you, and you still want to help Athens, which makes me admire you very much! It's just unfortunate that the two things came together, otherwise Lord Pharnabazus could have done that (Pharnabazus In order to retaliate against Agesilaus for ravaging western Asia Minor, he persuaded the governors of Asia Minor to agree to let Conon lead the combined fleet of western Asia Minor to attack Sparta. Finally, he acquiesced to Conon to privately incorporate these warships into Athens). friendship, I will provide you with more support!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Timothy could only lament his bad luck. He was silent for a moment, took a sip of wine, and then asked doubtfully: "I have never seen The King of Persia, why did he specifically mention me in his letter?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ariobazenis smiled and said: "Timotheus, you underestimate yourself. Your performance in the war with Sparta Excellent, you have proven to the world that you are an excellent naval commander as talented as your father. I think the king who has been paying attention to the Greek war must have known your name because of this. You have to know that although we in Persia are powerful, But it lacks a good naval commander, otherwise it would not have suffered many defeats in previous naval battles with Greece. Although Egypt's navy is not strong, but -"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ariobazenis sneered: "But that king Having suffered defeats in several previous wars, he will never allow himself to fail again this time in his personal crusade against Egypt, so of course he wants to choose a good naval general to assist him... No matter what, this It's a good thing for you. If you can get the appreciation of the king, you might be able to ask him to lead the entire Persian navy to rescue Greece and fight against Theonia.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Timothy's heart moved, and at that moment he had decided to go to Tire.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ariobazenis obviously saw what he was thinking, and then said: "Timotheus, if you agree to accept the invitation of the great king, can you do me two small favors?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Ario, you are too polite. , since I left Athens and came to Phrygia, you have always taken good care of me. I am worried that I will not have the opportunity to repay you, let alone two, even 100. As long as I can do it, I will do my best to provide you with Help!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Okay, then I'll tell you the truth! I spent several years of Phrygian taxes to barely build such a fleet. If you are reused by that great king, I hope you will be used by the same king in Egypt. Try to preserve these warships of mine during the battle."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Timothy replied simply: "Don't worry, I will do my best to do it!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The second task is... you join the king's command and participate in the battle against Egypt. After that, can you... write to me regularly about the movements of the entire army in detail? You know... Well, there is a lot of trade between Frisia and Egypt. I need to make some decisions based on the development of the war. The Frisian merchants who are still in some towns in Egypt must either evacuate as soon as possible, or simply take the opportunity to seize some important supplies and minerals there..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Timothy hesitated for a moment, then responded: "I will write to you. Letter, but after arriving in Phenicia, I may be mainly responsible for the navy, and I may not be very clear about the future trends of the King of Persia's army..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Just do your best!" Ariobazenis smiled and raised his glass: "Let's drink a toast and wish you all the best in the next battle!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Late at night, Aliobazenis's trusted servant, who had disappeared for some time, quietly returned to the Governor's Mansion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ario Barzenis summoned him alone in his study.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Master, 15 days ago I arrived at Samalla in Cappadescia. The Governor secretly received me. I showed him both the letter you wrote and the letter written by the Egyptian Pharaoh. It's his reply."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alio Barzenis quickly took the letter and looked happy after reading it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the trusted servant was curious, he knew enough not to ask.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, Ariobazenis couldn't help but say: "Stridatus not only agreed to my suggestion and decided to accept the Egyptian Pharaoh's plan and join hands with everyone, but he also offered to persuade Pafra Governor of Goni, Lycaonia, Armenia and other regions."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Master, there are too many people to contact, and it will be difficult to keep it secret!" the confidant reminded worriedly.
  </font>
