   Chapter 1256 The Little Prince

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two were moved by what Davos said in his letter that "a grand and unique sports meeting will be held", so they came.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to show respect for them, Davos invited them to the royal stand.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as the two entered, they were attracted by the band entering the venue.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What's the name of this music? It sounds like a very good melody." Xenophon, like many Theonian allies, was moved by this light and powerful melody and asked curiously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before Davos could answer, Plato took over: "'March', this is a piece that must be played during the march of the Theonian army. It was composed by King Davos."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xenophon was surprised: "I didn't expect you, Davos, to be talented in this area!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Xenophon spoke to Davos in private, he still used to use the common titles he used in Persia, and Davos never cared. At this moment, he was humble. Said: "These are all inspired by the great Hades. The final completion of them is the credit of the palace musicians." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The music is beautiful! But it can bring together so many different instruments and so many musicians. Together, they can play such a harmonious and beautiful melody instead of creating chaotic and noisy sounds. How can this be done?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not only Xenophon was surprised, almost all the Greek people in the audience were surprised, because of the traditional Most of the Greek music is played by a single instrument, and occasionally there is an ensemble, which is also performed between a few instruments and a few musicians. With such a huge band and so many instruments (some instruments from other races, the Greeks They didn't know each other yet) performing a large ensemble together, which was completely beyond their knowledge of music, and they were all curious: How do the Theonians control such a large band and make it produce grand, thick and layered melodies?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Do you know Philosanus?" Plato asked Xenophon.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Of course I know. He was once a musical poet in Syracuse..." Xenophon hesitated and did not continue.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Philosanus was quite original in the format and melody of musical poetry, so he was well-known in Greece. He also published poems at sports events in Greece.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After he joined Theonia, he made a greater breakthrough in music poetry. However, because some of his poems included chapters praising Hades and King Davos, he was publicly condemned by several priests of the Holy Land. , was not favored by the senior officials of the local Greek city-states, but many Greek scholars treasured his poems in private and carefully appreciated his improvements in music and poetry formats and rhymes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Philosanus was a teacher at the School of Liberal Arts of the Theonian Academy. In addition to teaching students how to write poetry, he was also studying how to make different instruments play harmonious melodies together. I once saw him organize The students were playing music, as they are now, and lo and behold, the old man standing at the front of the orchestra was Philosanus!" The
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   reason why Plato was so familiar with Philosanus was because he was captured during the Greek Wars. After the people of Athens were expelled, they ran to Thurii with their students, accepted Davos's invitation, and served as a teacher at Theonia Academy in a short period of time. In addition to teaching, he also visited other teachers carefully. and students, to study the operating mechanism of the entire academy, hoping to learn from it and improve the teaching of Akademi Academy.

   At this time, the band had already circled the field and entered the center of the field to line up near the royal stand, but the music continued.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "So that's it." Although Xenophon also collected the poems of Philosanus, he had never seen him. He stared closely at the old man in front of the band who kept pointing with a wooden stick, and suddenly realized Said: "If you want such a huge band to play a harmonious melody, you need a commander, just like the commander of the army, who is responsible for arranging the troops and arranging who attacks first and who attacks last, so that we can fully Bring out the strength of the soldiers to win..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xenophon is indeed a scholar with both civil and military skills who wrote "On Cavalry", using war as a metaphor.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But the role of band conductor is not so simple. Philosanus has only achieved a small amount of success after studying for so many years... But Davos is not going to explain more to dampen Xenophon's interest.

   Although Olympia did not send priests to participate in the training and selection of the referee team for the Theonian Games, due to the Theonian commitment to the Games There would not be a special sacrifice for Hades, so Olympia accepted the invitation and sent a priest as a representative to watch the sports meeting.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Olympian priest Pesias sat in the VIP seat with a critical and prudent attitude. While other distinguished guests were surprised by the splendor and excitement of Hades's main arena and moved by the band's performance, he was surprised by the performance of the band. Scoff: The Games are the Greeks' respect for gods and love for sports. These sensational things are useless!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, he heard the host shouting: "Now please invite the referee team of this sports meeting to enter!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He immediately cheered up.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The band's performance also changed from "March" to "Ode to Hades".
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Accompanied by the quiet and solemn melody, more than 200 priests in white robes entered the arena in a loose column. Walking at the front was a young man from Turiyi School. He solemnly held up a ball with the words " A wooden sign with the words "Judge Panel".
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Following the young man was an old priest with a smile. When he looked towards the audience, the Theonian audience suddenly became excited: "It's Cardias who is the priest!!!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Cardias Ten years ago, because of his outstanding missionary achievements in the Roman area, Si was transferred back to the Tulii area to serve as the priest in charge. In recent years, because of his old age and lack of energy, Plessinas transferred all Hadi in the Tulii area. He took over all the affairs of the Si temple, and Plessinas also recommended him as his successor. With Davos's approval, he will be promoted to the priest of the scepter at the end of the year.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, as the chief referee of the entire referee team, he walked in front of the team.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As the referee team moved forward, the Theonian audience sang the hymns of various gods loudly, because more and more priests of various temples were recognized by the people outside the stadium.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Greek audiences were surprised that there were many priests in the referee team who looked obviously different from the Greeks. Through the singing of the nearby Theonian audience, they learned that some of these aliens came from the Temple of Hades, and some from Other foreign temples, such as the Temple of Savone in Samolea, the Temple of Mahala in Bruti, the Temple of Barhamon in Carthage, the Temple of Diana in Rome...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Olympia had also received notice from Theonia about "the priests of various temples forming a referee group" in advance, at this moment Pesias saw so many priests of different gods and races walking so quietly and obediently on the field. In the same team, I couldn't help but take a deep breath, and suddenly felt a little uneasy about being isolated: Are we the only Olympians and Delphic priests who didn't participate?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, he suddenly heard a Theonia elder next to him say in surprise: "The boy holding the sign seems to be the grandson of His Majesty Davos, Christod?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It doesn't seem to be, he is!" My youngest son was a classmate with him. This time he was not selected to participate in the opening ceremony of the sports meeting. He cried with me when he came home."

   The heated discussion among the Theonian officials at the VIP table naturally aroused the excitement in Greece. With the attention of city-state envoys, after Theonia became the overlord of the Greek world, they would of course have a detailed understanding of the Theonia royal family: Hades Davos Christode, Theonia Dave The grandson of King Si and the son of Crown Prince Crotokartax, according to the eldest son inheritance system of the Theonia royal family, he is likely to become the next king.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the early days of the establishment of Theonia, royal members of the generation of Cynthia and Clotokatax were studying at Turiine City School (the school was located in the easternmost part of the Craty River Delta, next to Theonia School). Park), the population of Turiyi was not large at that time, and the children of citizens of the inner city and the outer city all attended schools in the inner city of Turii, so most people in Turiyi knew the royal family members.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   By the time Christode was studying, due to the expansion of the population of Thurii City and the complete establishment of the royal prestige, not only was it difficult for children in the outer city of Thurii to attend schools in the inner city, but there was also a palace when Christode was in school. Guard protection, so it is normal that most of the Theonia audience did not recognize him when they first entered the venue today.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After his identity was exposed and the eyes of thousands of viewers were focused on him, the young Christophe would inevitably feel nervous. Fortunately, Chalcedis behind him kept comforting him with gentle words: "My child, Don't be afraid! The audience has no ill intentions. On the contrary, they are happy that there is a successor to the Hades royal family. Listen, they are cheering for you! You should give them a smile and express your gratitude to them!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Christod's character is more He was very much like his father, and his grandmother took him with him and taught him carefully when he was very young. He was very particular about how to treat others. Therefore, even though he was still a little nervous, he still held the wooden sign tightly, turned his head and squeezed hard towards the audience. Give a smile.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The audience cheered even louder.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Soon, he walked to the front of the royal stand and clearly saw his family standing in front of the railing at the front of the stand: kind grandparents, gentle father, stern mother, gentle aunt (Cynthia) ), the relatively withdrawn second uncle (Apox), the childish uncle, the beautiful sister-in-law... all waved to him and smiled at him.
