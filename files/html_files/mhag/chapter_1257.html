   Chapter 1257 Entrance Ceremony
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And Christode's second brother, Crimides, grabbed the railing with both hands and shouted excitedly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   His lively second aunt (Eunice) even waved her fist and kept shouting: "Chris, good job! You are such a brave child!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Christold smiled, this time He came from the bottom of his heart, and this smile also took away the nervousness in his heart. He held his head high and held the wooden sign high, leading the referee team around the field, and then entered the center of the field and stood still.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just now, all the spectators were wondering why there was a wooden cart pushing behind the referee team. On the wooden cart was a half-person-high bronze basin supported by a golden copper pillar. At this time, the answer was revealed: push. The priests of the cart pushed the wooden cart to the center of the arena, quickly disassembled it, and reassembled it into a small wooden platform. The large bronze basin was placed on the wooden platform, looking like a simple altar.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, the red flag was raised again on the host stage, and the audience gradually returned to silence.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Now please invite the athlete delegations from all regions of the kingdom and the participating city-states to enter!!!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the host's passionate shouts, the band immediately played the "Victory March", and the cheerful melody sounded on the field, and the audience Everyone was refreshed and looked eagerly towards the entrance of the arena.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The athletes who had been waiting outside the main arena for a long time finally entered the venue one after another under the command of the Theonian soldiers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Through the previous entrance of the band and the referee team, the audience has begun to adapt to the novel opening ceremony of the Theonian Games. They began to excitedly guess who the first athlete delegation to enter will be. Some people even used this to bet.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The answer in many people's minds is - the Thurii region of the Sacred Kingdom of Theonia, because it is the center of this powerful kingdom in the Western Mediterranean and the venue for this Games. It deserves to be the leader.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But when the Turri boy walked into the venue first holding a wooden sign, and the audience could clearly see the words on the wooden sign, they were all surprised: Arcadia Alliance?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Why the Arcadian Alliance?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Only some distinguished guests close to the royal stands could barely hear the host's voice through the noise: "...In order to demonstrate the principle of 'equality and justice' advocated by the great god Hades in this sports meeting, Yingming His Majesty Davos proposed to the Games preparatory team to arrange the admission order of each sports delegation according to the order of the Greek letters of the names of the participating regions and city-states..." The
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   representatives of the Greek city-states suddenly realized that Dionysius Asia actually fulfilled the promise they made in the invitation letter that "all participating city-states, regardless of their size, will be treated equally", which made them somewhat moved.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lycomedes, who was talking quietly to Pelopidas, learned that the athletes of the Arcadian League were entering the stadium. He immediately jumped up, completely ignoring his valuable status in the Arcadian League. Like other spectators from the Arcadian League, they waved their arms at the athletes, shouted loudly, and cheered them on.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The city-states in the Arcadian League are not large in population and not strong in strength, but they are all Greek city-states with a long history and are very close to the venues where the four traditional sports games are held. Influenced by them, their level of traditional sports has improved. Never weak, and with the close relationship between Mantinia and Theonia, under the strong promotion of Lycomedes, the Arcadian League sent more than 50 athletes, who will participate in swimming, horse racing, and racing. and other competitive sports besides archery.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as the Arcadia League athletes entered the arena, they were immediately enveloped in deafening cheers, which really shocked them. These athletes had all participated in a sports meeting at least once, but they had never seen such a large audience. In such a glorious arena, the cheers were like thunder, rolling and reverberating in the circular space, which not only shocked them, but also ignited the blood in their hearts.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The depression of waiting outside the arena for a long time was quickly forgotten. They also waved to the audience enthusiastically. There was a good interaction inside and outside the arena, making the atmosphere even more lively.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the delegation of Acadian athletes approached the royal stand, Davos and his family still did not return to their seats, and there was another person beside the railings, that is, the late Adoris's wife Aedui .
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   They smiled and waved at the boy holding the wooden sign, and shouted encouragement.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The young man kept moving forward, but his eyes were a little wet.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The boy, who looked to be two years older than Christod, was named Aenon and was the only son of Adoris.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Adoris died in the battle, both Clotokatax and Davos felt deeply guilty, so they took extra care of Aedui and his son.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the Arcadian delegation passed the royal stands, the second athlete delegation entered the arena. The word "Argos" was clearly engraved on the wooden sign, which made the distinguished guests from the allied countries completely believe what the host said. Words: Theonia is indeed impartial in arranging the admission of sports delegations in alphabetical order, without any partiality.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Argos is in a bit of a bad situation right now.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the past, it has been working hard to bring the entire fertile Argos triangular plain in the northeastern corner of the Peloponnese into its control to fight against the powerful Sparta. However, in this area, the Mycenaean and Titian With the secret support of Sparta, several city-states such as Lins have always had conflicts of interest with it. Even Cleone (the venue of the Nemean Games) under its control has wanted independence from time to time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although after the Greek War, Argos surrendered in time and made some contributions during the siege of Athens. After many requests, he finally received the support of Theonia and basically completed the attack on Argos. The plain areas were unified and declared to the outside world as the "Argos Plains Alliance".
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, Argos is an oligarchy, somewhat similar to Sparta, and lacks outstanding political leaders like Pelopidas and Lycomedes. The methods implemented in the integration of the entire plain area in recent years are simple and crude. , aroused dissatisfaction with other city-states in the region, and conflicts broke out, so this time Argos actively responded to Theonia's invitation and sent a team of more than 40 athletes, hoping that at the next Greek League meeting Theonia's support can be obtained again when discussing issues related to the conflict in the Triangular Plain of Argos in the Peloponnese.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although there were very few Argosian spectators in the arena, the enthusiastic Theonia audience still gave friendly cheers to the Argos League players just like they did to the Arcadian delegation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the formation of the Argos athlete delegation seems a bit strange. The Argos athletes with a large number of people gather together and walk in front, and the Argos allied athletes with a small number gather together and trail behind. There is quite a distance, and anyone who cares can see what is going on.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Plato, who understood the inside story, asked directly: "How is Theonia prepared to deal with the conflict on the Argos Plain?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This will be an important topic at the Greek League meeting early next month. At that time, we will convene the main members of all the city-states in the Argos Plain to discuss, not only to listen to the opinions of Argos, but also to listen carefully to other The reasonable demands of the city-state..." Davos looked serious and said implicitly: "Try to come up with a solution acceptable to all parties and resolve this dispute peacefully."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The Argos and Spartans Some are similar, conservative and stubborn, and have a long-standing and deep-rooted tradition of dominating the Argos plain, and I am afraid they will not compromise easily." Plato reminded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Originally, Argos's strength was insufficient. Although there were some small battles with other city-states in the Argos Plain from time to time, it was basically able to maintain peace. Now that Argos has received strong support from Theonia, it has intensified The contradictions in the region have led to the current tense situation, and Theonia should bear a great responsibility!" Xenophon criticized unceremoniously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's just that some conflicts occurred, and no war broke out. The situation is much better than before when battles broke out at every turn. How can it be said that it intensified the conflict-" Plato defended Theonia instead.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "That's just because the Greek Union has decrees that city-states that cause war will be severely punished, so they are all exercising restraint-" Xenophon retorted.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Isn't this the credit of Theonia? It is precisely because Theonia established and led the Greek Alliance that there was a long-term peaceful situation in the Greek mainland -" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I did not deny that Theonia was in this regard Regarding the achievements made, I just think that Theonia is somewhat inadequate in dealing with the issues of Argos and other city-states in the Argos Plain-" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You have to know that in the process of Theonia pacifying mainland Greece, Argos did provide some help. Since Theonia can help Mandinia and Thebes integrate their respective regions, there is nothing wrong with supporting Argos. After all, Mycenae and other city-states did not give Theonia throughout the Greek wars. Olya is grateful for any help."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "But it turns out that the choice Theonia made was wrong!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You can't use the wrong result to deny the reasonableness of the original decision! And it's not a bad thing to make mistakes. Theonia can make improvements based on this. But I think that under the current situation, Argos still adopts the same oligarchic system as old Sparta, and it is almost impossible to lead other people on the Argos plain. City-state--"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The former Sparta was not an oligarchic entity at all. On the contrary, it was a mixed government system of monarchy and democracy that had more classical traditional virtues than other Greek city-states--" "This
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   is the first time I have heard this. But I don't agree with it. First, let's take a look, was Sparta a monarchy? -"
