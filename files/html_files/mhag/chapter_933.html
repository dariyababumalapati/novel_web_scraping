   Chapter 933 Hanno's Counterattack
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing this, Preeta Kouba remained silent for the time being. As a senator of the Senate and a newly re-elected Sufit, of course he could not tell lies with open eyes and let others laugh.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before he could think of what to say, El Akela continued to speak loudly: "As Mr. Esiyaruba said, nearly 1/3 of our treasury revenue comes from Sardinia and Kota Kinabalu. Sijia, it is now during the war, and money is urgently needed everywhere. As the Sofitel of Carthage, Mr. Preta Kuba, you should consider more comprehensively the huge situation that Carthage is involved in. In the war, we must first consider how to maintain the source of our treasury revenue to ensure that we can build more warships and purchase more food to continue this war, instead of just satisfying Lord Mago's requirements! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   El Acra's words were straightforward enough, and Preta Kuba's face changed a little.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Sifakba, another new senator of the Magonid faction, said angrily: "Don't you understand? The key to this war lies in Sicily! Just when Master Mago led the army and Theonia The east where people are fighting fiercely! The consumption of this war is indeed huge, so we must concentrate all our efforts to fully support the army in Sicily, so that Lord Mago can completely defeat the Theonians in Sicily as soon as possible, so that we can free up our hands. To support other battlefields.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Otherwise, even if we save Sardinia, the Sicilian army will be frustrated because the food transportation line cannot be guaranteed, which will change the originally advantageous battle situation and prevent the battle in Sicily from ending as soon as possible. That is not worth the loss! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Compared to El Akela, Sifakba's words were even more extreme, which immediately aroused the resentment of some elders in the venue. One of the neutral elders even said in a strange way: "It took half a month for Lord Mago to lead an army of 100,000 people. Time cannot capture a small village in Theonia, so wouldn't it take several months, or even more than half a year, to attack the cities of Katanai and Naxos, which have a larger population and stronger defenses? With such offensive capabilities, do you still want to end the Sicilian War as soon as possible?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, yes, the reason why we want to save Sardinia first is to consider that the war in Sicily will continue to prolong, so we must first provide gold and silver guarantees for the Sicilian army!" Another senator said half seriously, half jokingly said.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Is it because Lord Mago is worried that he will not be able to drive the Theonians out of Sicily within a year? I'm afraid you want to help Mr. Mago fulfill the promise he made in the Senate as soon as possible, so you don't care about the overall situation and keep trying to help him. "Another elder said dissatisfied.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sifakba was so angry that he argued loudly with them, but Preetakouba found that more and more senators expressed dissatisfaction. There were not only people from the Hanno faction, but also many senators from the neutral faction. The whole venue became noisy. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Only then did Preeta Kuba realize that he had made a mistake: Sardinia and Corsica had been possessions of Carthage for hundreds of years, and the various nobles of Carthage had close interests with Sardinia. For example, El Acra, who just fully supported the reinforcement of Sardinia, his family owns a silver mine in the mountains outside Saros, Sardinia, and his family transported silver bullion from Sardinia three days ago. The cargo ship returning to Carthage was captured by the Theonian warship...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He has always emphasized that the war in Sicily should be given priority, but he has inadvertently pushed the Magonid faction against other senators, causing almost all the neutral factions who had been supporting them since the beginning of the war to sing the opposite tune, including themselves. There also seemed to be some differences in the camp. For example, several Magonid elders such as Santipur had been silent since the beginning of the debate.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Preeta Kuba suddenly realized that Okriton had raised this issue at the beginning of today's meeting, probably with premeditated plans! During this period, the Magonid faction not only gained great prestige among the people of Carthage, but also gained a lot of support in the Senate, and many proposals were passed... When everything went smoothly, even he himself He was a little distracted, completely forgetting how scary that person was.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just when Preeta Kuba suddenly woke up and was anxiously trying to find a solution to the dilemma, Hanno, who was sitting in front of the venue and had been silent for a while, stood up.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The whole venue quickly became quiet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Should we support Sardinia or Sicily first for the new fleet?" Hanno looked around the venue and said slowly: "Whether it is the short-term effect it will produce or the long-term interests of Carthage, it is better to reinforce Sardinia." Niadu should be the first choice. The difficulty encountered by Sardinia is because the entire sea area is controlled by the Theonians, so the defense is so passive. We only need to send the navy to repel the Theonians. warships, order would be restored in Sardinia, and the Carthage-Sardinian trade route would be restored.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the main problem in the Sicilian war is not just the loss of maritime superiority. The important thing is that our army has been blocked from attacking on land for a long time. Even if we dispatch a fleet, they cannot go ashore to fight, and the problem still cannot be solved immediately. What do you think? Is it right? "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "That's right, Master Hannuo is absolutely right!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lord Hannuo still sees clearly!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "No more arguing, we choose to support the new fleet heading to Sardinia!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The venue suddenly became noisy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Preta Kuba said anxiously: "Master Hanno, you are wrong to say that! The key to our war with Theonia is still in Sicily. As long as Sicily wins, other problems will be solved, so support Sicily ..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Preta Kuba!" Hanno shouted, like a sleeping lion on the grassland suddenly showing strength, the whole venue became silent, his eyes looked directly at the head of the Magonid family in the Senate , said with a serious face: "In order to let Carthage win this war, I have tried my best to cooperate with you during this period, but your performance has disappointed me. For the benefit of your Magonid family, you even ignored it. The interests of Carthage as a whole are clearly reflected in the issue of sending a new fleet to support Sicily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And the last so-called reorganization of our Carthaginian army by Mago also reflected this. Why was such a huge army unable to capture a village in Theonia for a long time? Isn't it because Mago replaced all the Carthaginian generals in his army and replaced them with Numibians who followed him in Iberia as generals, which resulted in this result? Can these Numibians be loyal to Carthage? Can they order their compatriots to fight to the death against the Theonians regardless of their lives!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mago led his army from the initial attack to a stalemate, and he arbitrarily replaced the generals of the Carthaginian army. Isn't this the main reason for this situation? ! So what puzzles me is that the war has just begun. Why is Lord Mago so anxious to remove the Carthaginian generals who are loyal to Carthage and insist on replacing them with Carthage generals who have been following him but have no influence on Carthage? Emotional Numibians come to lead an army also composed of Numibians? ! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Preeta Kouba was speechless for a moment under Hanno's repeated questioning, but he broke out in a cold sweat.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sifakba hurriedly retorted: "That's because the Carthaginian generals did not fight well. Only by replacing them can the combat effectiveness of the army be improved! That's why our army was able to successfully conquer the Greek city-states on the south coast."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as these words came out, there was an uproar in the venue.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The senators rose up to retort: ​​"After replacing the Carthaginian generals, why can't a 100,000-strong army attack a small Theonian village?! This is also called an increase in combat effectiveness!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I propose that the Carthaginian army, which was formed at the expense of a large amount of revenue from the treasury, must be led by Carthaginian citizens. Otherwise, how can the security of the city-state be guaranteed?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Now Lord Mago is commanding an army mostly composed of foreigners as captains. Is this still a Carthaginian army? The Carthaginian generals who were originally replaced must be reinstated. Otherwise we will no longer provide any support to this army!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Facing the angry senators, Preeta Kouba's expression completely changed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Similarly, he watched this scene, and also looked at the dignified neutral leader Aisia Laba, but Hanno sneered in his heart: he died for so long, just for today. Mago made a big mistake when he replaced the Carthaginian generals before, because most of these generals were Carthaginian nobles, but he did not let the senators close to him impeach him at the time. As a result, today, the now rampant Ma Sure enough, the Magonid faction made mistakes in the use of the new fleet. He then attacked decisively, forcing the neutral senators to see the true face of the Magonid faction. As their support for it weakened, the Senate's Dominance will surely return to his hands again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thinking of this, Hanno said loudly again: "My lords, please listen to me."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The noisy venue quickly returned to silence, but Preeta Kuba was frightened.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The meeting has been discussed so far, and the results are relatively clear. The new fleet will first reinforce Sardinia and look for opportunities to recapture Alenia, not only to ensure treasury revenue and enable us to continue fighting with Theonia, but also It is also our duty to fulfill our obligations as leaders of all Phoenician city-states in the Western Mediterranean. Now not only all the Phoenician people are paying attention to this war, don't forget that there are also people from the mother country who are also inquiring about the news in the city of Hadrumentum. (Referring to the remaining fleet dispatched from the East Phoenician region), if we don't do this, we will definitely lose our prestige, and will we be able to order other Phoenician allies in the future?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hanno's careful political considerations made many senators nod involuntarily.
