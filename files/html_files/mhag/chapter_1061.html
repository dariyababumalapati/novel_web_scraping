   Chapter 1061 Royal Family Trivia
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Christoya was not as excited as Agnes, she also changed her previous sick look. She raised her upper body and leaned her back on the bed. There was still some doubt on her face: "Dido actually agreed?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "She is your daughter-in-law. You are sick and want to see your grandson. How could she not agree? I just finished writing the letter and received their reply only four days later. It shows that they care about you very much!" Diver! Si endorsed Dido.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, sister, Dido is quite considerate." Agnes also supported Davos's secret instructions.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Christoya glanced at them and muttered dissatisfiedly: "What do you know?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then she thought of something else and asked immediately: "Isn't Dido going back to Thurii as well?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "She stayed in Rome with Croto."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Christoya felt relieved now. She put her hand on her stomach: "I'm hungry and want to eat something."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agnes smiled reassuringly and said, "I'll let Molina make arrangements."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as she walked out of the palace, a crisp shout came from outside: "Mother, we are back!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Eunice strode into the house, just in time to see Kristoya lifting the quilt and preparing to get off the ground.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Ah, mother, are you healed?! It seems that Hades has answered our prayers!" Eunice said excitedly, then stood there with her palms raised to the sky, chanted a few words silently, and then entered the house Aviya also made the same move.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Christoya waited for them to finish thanking Hades, and then asked: "Did you go to the Temple of Hades?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's the Hill of the Gods, and only the temple there is the most effective!" Eunice emphasized.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Krystoya, look how filial these two children are! I know that since you got sick, Eunice and Ivia have been worried about you and haven't gone out to play in the past few days..." Dai Firth praised his two daughters greatly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Chrystoya was a little moved after hearing this. She opened her arms and said, "Eunice, mom, thank you!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Eunice rushed over and hugged Kristoya.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Oh, you reckless guy, can't you be gentler! I'm afraid I'll have to stay in bed for a few more days after you hit me so hard." Kristoya lightly slapped her daughter on the back and complained jokingly. road.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Eunice twisted a few times in her arms.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Aiweiya, come here too." Christia smiled and patted the bed next to her with her hand.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yeah." Aviya, who was standing not far away, immediately rushed over and was hugged by Kristoya.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The mother and daughter hugged each other, and Christoya said happily: "It's better to be a daughter!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then she said with a smile: "In two days, your nephew will be back!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Pyrrhus (Cynthia's son) comes every few days, so there's nothing surprising." Eunice disagreed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You little fool, he's your nephew!" Christoya hit Eunice on the back with a little force.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's Chris!" Eunice's voice immediately rose an octave, and then she said in surprise: "My sister-in-law actually agrees?!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Christoya immediately glanced at Davos, which meant: You see, the children all think so.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then she said: "Your father has spoken, how can she disagree?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Oh." Eunice nodded, and then said happily: "That's great, when Chris comes, I will take him to ride the Stat!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Christoya immediately slapped her again and cursed: "You silly girl, don't think carefully about how Chris can ride your Egyptian horse when he is only two years old!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Mother, Stat is not an Egyptian horse, it is an Arabian horse." Eunice also argued.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Shut up." Crystal scolded impatiently.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Mother Crystal, I will take good care of Chris. Can I take him to play with Melita (the black cat)? Melita is very gentle and never hurts anyone." Aviya asked softly. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Of course." Christoya responded with a smile.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Eccentric." Eunice pouted.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The three of them sat beside the bed for a while, and then Davos asked, "Eunice, you two went to the Hill of the Gods today. How is the construction of the main temple going?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Father, you asked the right question. Master Plessinas took Aviya and I to inspect the construction site carefully. It seems that all the projects are progressing smoothly, and all the craftsmen are doing a great job. Through hard work, all the outer corridor columns of the entire temple have been erected, half of the outer wall has been repaired, the carving of the statue of Hades has been completed, and the skin is being pasted..." Eunice talked eloquently.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos listened carefully and nodded happily: "Well, it was very detailed. It seems that the construction of the main temple is progressing very well! You two really inspected it carefully. I want to express my gratitude to you!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Of course! Although we are women, we are the daughters of the wise and kind King Theonia, and we can still do something for your father!" Eunice puffed up her chest and boasted of herself.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos chuckled and said, "Well, okay, my daughter, I like to hear what you say."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, Aviya let out a sigh and couldn't help laughing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It seems that Aviya has a different opinion." Davos smiled and looked at his youngest daughter.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Facing her father's loving gaze, Aviya felt a little panicked. She hurriedly said: "I...ah, no, I just remembered my sister...my sister's depressed look on the way back...so I couldn't help but want to laugh. ."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Depressed? What's going on?" Davos felt strange. His eldest daughter had always been energetic, cheerful and optimistic. Even if she was often scolded by Crystal, she rarely looked depressed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Aiweiya, don't say it!" Eunice said urgently, threatening her with her teeth and claws.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Good child, ignore her, tell us quickly." Christoya also became interested, holding Eunice in her arms and not allowing her to get close to Aviya.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Aviya timidly glanced at Eunice, who was grinning at her, and spoke quickly and briefly described the incident.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Oh, there are actually young people who are so bold and dare to accuse our Eunice in person!" Davos looked surprised and stroked his beard, showing interest rather than anger.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Eunice has been scolded by outsiders for the first time since she was a child, and she doesn't dare to talk back. This is better than those young people in Turiyi! ...Krystoya was even more thoughtful.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Eunice was already 17 years old and at the age to get married. Many matchmakers came to her door to propose marriage, but none of them fell in love with Eunice. Kristoya has followed Davos for so many years, and under his influence, she has gradually agreed with his concept: try to let the children choose their partners independently, so that the marriage will be happy (of course, Clotokatax will definitely not be able to , as the heir to the throne, his marriage is destined to contain many political factors. Although Christoya does not like Dido, she has to admit that the combination of the two makes Crotokatax's position more stable. It is precisely because of this that she does not care that the last two children must marry high-ranking officials).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, Eunice's personality was too strong, and because of her prominent background, Kristoya was more worried about her future marriage, so she suddenly heard that such a unique young man appeared, just like a drowning man. It's like seeing a life-saving straw suddenly. Regardless of his identity or background, he should grab it first.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, please send someone to investigate the identity and background of this young man first…" Christoya winked at Davos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Father, why are you still investigating? Such an unreasonable person should be expelled from Turii immediately and not allowed to participate in the competition to design the Colossus on the top of the mountain!" Eunice said angrily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Ah? Ah! Yes! Yes!" Davos responded repeatedly, but did not clearly indicate whether he was in favor or against.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The family chatted happily for a while, and Molina came in and said, "Your Majesty, dinner is ready."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sitting in the dining room, Davos realized that there were still two empty seats, and asked hurriedly: "Are Apox and Briantes not back yet?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Molina, the housekeeper who was standing by, said hurriedly: "His Royal Highness Apox sent someone back to say that there was a research project in the School of Mathematics that was not finished today, so he had dinner in the school... His Highness Briantes is still there. Attend rugby training and he'll be back later."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos looked at the slightly sparse dining table and was a little dazed: In a blink of an eye, the children are all grown up and each has his or her own business. It may be difficult to see the scene of the family gathering together and having a lively meal like before!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos sighed softly in his heart and said, "Let's eat."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After dinner, Molina entered the dining room again: "Your Majesty, Aristelas wishes to see you."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Oh." Davos knew that Aristelas was a knowledgeable person. If there was no urgent matter, he would not disturb him at this time. He pretended to be relaxed and said: "Let him wait in the study, I will come in a moment." Go over. Eunice, I give you a task to take good care of your mother."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "She is so helpless, what can she do! I am already well and I don't need her to take care of me," Christoya said.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Mother, am I still your daughter? You always make fun of me!" Eunice shouted in disbelief.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There was a burst of laughter in the dining room.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos came to the study and saw that his palace herald was still standing in front of the desk, looking as calm as ever. The seriousness of what he was about to report could not be seen from his face alone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the greeting, Davos first motioned for him to sit down, and then asked: "What important matter brings you here at this time?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Regarding this matter, our intelligence personnel in Turiyi have been aware of it and have carried out special monitoring. Today we received another tip from a slave in the slave camp. It is finally completely certain - Your Majesty, within ten days Later, at the opening ceremony of the All-Hellenic Scholars Conference, someone planned to assassinate you."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
