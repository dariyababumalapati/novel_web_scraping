   Chapter 1299 Conquest of Canaan and Tire
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before the Theonian army fully surrounded Jerusalem, the Jewish high priest took the initiative to go to the Theonian camp and humbly expressed to King Davos that "the Jews are willing to submit to Dionysius" Kingdom of Asia" will.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos was more cautious about this special race in the Mediterranean world that believed in the only god. He quickly accepted the surrender of the Jews, and also made promises and warnings: "As long as the Jews are loyal to the sacred kingdom of Theonia, then the Jews can They have the right to live according to their own laws and religions, but at the same time, Jews cannot affect the life rights of other races under the rule of the Holy Kingdom of Theonia because of their own customs, otherwise Theonia will definitely intervene!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Second King Davos was greeted at the gate of Jerusalem by the high priest in a purple robe and thousands of Jerusalemites led by him. Davos followed the example of Cyrus and once again conveyed the promises he made and The warning is read out in public.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The people cheered, and at the same time, the Jewish priests also bound Nehemiah, the governor of Canaan appointed by Artaxerxes, who worked hard for the reconstruction of the Canaan region, and his subordinates, and pushed them to Davos and handed them over to him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos did not severely punish the Persian governor, who was also a Jew, in public. On the contrary, after he brought him back to the camp, he asked Nehemiah in a friendly manner: If he is willing to serve the Kingdom of Theonia, he will wait until he gets familiar with Theonia. After establishing Asia's political system and legal system, he will be sent to govern the Canaan region again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Jews have a lively character and are not conservative and stubborn. Nehemiah obviously inherited this characteristic. Surrendering to Theonia would not only survive, but also make it possible to fulfill his long-cherished wish to rebuild Jerusalem and seek revenge on the Jewish priests who betrayed him, so he He happily knelt down in front of Davos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   With Nehemiah as a guide, the Theonian army quickly conquered the entire Canaan region, and then under his leadership, successfully invaded the Samaria region east of Jerusalem, quickly captured many towns, and also captured the Sanballat, the regional governor, gave Nehemiah a big sigh of relief.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Canaan and Samaria were successively conquered by Theonia, making Gaza an isolated Persian enclave.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Persian defenders panicked, and they eagerly wanted to leave this dangerous place and return to their hometown.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Under the strong request of the soldiers, the defender general had to ask the soldiers to bring enough water, quietly leave Gaza City, and march northeast, trying to bypass the area occupied by the Theonian army and pass through the east Trade road on the edge of the desert, heading to Damascus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Unexpectedly, the Theonian army had been paying close attention to the movements of Gaza City, and soon discovered the intentions of the Persian defenders.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the second day, the four cavalry legions of Theonia and the Numibian light cavalry legion caught up with the marching Persian defenders. The light cavalry legion harassed them with bows, arrows and javelins. The cavalry legion launched an attack, and soon The Gaza defenders were defeated, and Gaza City successfully fell under the control of the Theonian army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After completely stabilizing the rear, Davos led the army to continue northward and soon entered the Phoenician area.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It can be said that among the areas affiliated with Persia, the earliest enemies of Theonia were the Phoenicians. When the Phoenicians made the decision to send a fleet thousands of miles away to support Carthage, I am afraid they never thought of it. One day the Theonian army will approach the city, and the first city that the Theonian army will attack is the initiator of the year - Tire.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Phoenicia surrendered to Persia, the successive kings of Persia promised to allow the Phoenicians to live in their original way as long as Phoenicia paid a certain share of gold and silver every year and their fleet was at their disposal at any time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For hundreds of years, the Persian kings rarely interfered in the administrative affairs of the Phoenicians. One of the important reasons was that the mountains in Lebanon separated Phoenicia from inland Persia, making land transportation very inconvenient, and this terrain It also had a great impact on Phoenicia. They did not have vast and fertile cultivated land and could not support a larger population. They could only devote all their efforts to developing at sea, and thus became rich and prosperous due to maritime trade.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, due to certain conflicts in the commercial interests of various Phoenician city-states, although they established a Phoenician city-state alliance very early, they were never able to form a unified country.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, the king of Persia was quite satisfied with the independent state of the Phoenician city-states, and the Phoenician city-states also took advantage of Persia's long-standing good treatment of them and made a lot of profits from trade with the interior. Therefore, they had great influence on Persia. Still relatively loyal.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tire was the most powerful of the Phoenician city-states, and its city was built on a small island about eight miles away from the coast, making it easy to defend but difficult to attack.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   King Alexander of Macedonia, who had a successful attack on Persia in his previous life, encountered setbacks here and spent more than half a year.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is precisely because of this memory that Davos was very cautious when he led his army to Tire. He planned to lead the generals to take warships to carefully survey the defense situation of Tire City, and then consider whether to attack the city directly or through a long-term siege. Force him to surrender.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But before he set out, the messenger from Tire arrived first.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The emissary of Tire was still an acquaintance - the former Carthaginian Sufi Tepanlaco.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After meeting Davos, not only did he not show his previous arrogance and hostility towards Theonia, he was even a little flattering, so the atmosphere of the entire meeting was relatively relaxed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos asked about the current situation of Hanno and others, and Tai Panlaco's expression became a little heavy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It turned out that after Theonia forced Carthage to expel the Hannoists, most people chose to settle in Tire, the former mother state, and Tire also accepted them. However, the overwhelming power of Hanno and others in Carthage was not only unable to reappeared, and Tyr's senior officials also intentionally suppressed it, making it difficult for them to gain some power.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The people of Tyre used to be extremely envious of Carthage's wealth and power, but now they often despise these homeless dogs. Although they have no worries about food and clothing (Occleton, who took refuge in Theonia, persuaded the Carthaginian parliament to allow them to bring them with him out of guilt. He took away part of his property), but his life was relatively depressing, especially for Hanno. He who once responded to everything could not bear such loneliness at all, and died of depression within a few years.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But since Theonia declared war on Persia, Tyr's senior officials began to pay attention to Tepanlaco and the others. Not only did they often ask them about the situation in Theonia, they also elected Taipanlaco and several others to become members of the parliament. Let's discuss how to deal with the attack of the Theonian army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reason why Tai Panlaco was sent as an envoy was because he was familiar with the Theonians and was more easily accepted by the Theonians.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The purpose of Taipanlaco's mission was to surrender to Theonia on behalf of Tire.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos did not appear happy about this good news, but was a little cautious, because in his memory, when Alexander led his army to Tire, the Tire people also took the initiative to surrender, but when Alexander proposed to go to Tire city, When they worshiped Heracles in the Temple of Melce, Tyre immediately refused. It turned out that they just chose to surrender in the face of military pressure and wanted to wait for the final battle between Alexander's army and the Persian army before making the final decision. choice.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So Davos made the same request, and Tai Panlaco said that he could not make a decision and needed to ask the Tyr Council for its opinion before he could reply.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After he left by boat, Davos immediately reminded the generals: Be prepared for battle and don't be fooled by the Tyrians' surrender.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Unexpectedly, in the afternoon, Typanlaco came to the Theonia camp again and sincerely expressed to Davos: The Tire Parliament is ready to welcome the visit of King Davos at any time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos did not refuse, and led a group of elite troops to the island the next day, and was greeted respectfully by the Tyrians.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Heracles is one of the most popular gods in the Sacred Kingdom of Theonia, so Davos worshiped its statue here more solemnly. The Tyrians were always calm during the entire sacrifice process. , which made Davos believe in their sincerity.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Based on what he observed in Tire City, Davos analyzed the reasons why the Tire people made completely opposite choices to those in their previous lives.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   That's because in the previous history, although Alexander won consecutive victories in land battles, his navy was very weak. He even disbanded his already weak fleet at one point, causing the Persian fleet to harass the rear areas he conquered many times, creating problems for him. After a lot of trouble, Alexander could only finally gain dominance in the Eastern Mediterranean by capturing Persian towns one by one along the Mediterranean coast. This was no other way.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Precisely because of this, the Tyrians bullied him because he had no navy and it would be difficult to conquer their city in the sea, so they dared to delay time by pretending to surrender.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, Alexander did encounter great difficulties when attacking Tire due to lack of navy. Even though the surrender of Cyprus later provided him with a fleet, it took him more than 7 months to capture Tire. Time, time consuming and laborious.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But the Holy Kingdom of Theonia is different. It has a powerful navy, and it defeated the Persian fleet twice in Samos and Cyprus. It not only established absolute superiority at sea, but also completely controlled the Near East waters.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not long ago, the troops that landed in Cyprus have conquered the entire island. The First and Second Fleets have stationed in the Cyprus military port, which is very close to Tire. They can block and attack Tire at any time, posing a great threat to the city of Tire.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, although the Macedonian army in the previous life was very powerful, its number was only 40,000 to 50,000 people. Compared with the Persian army, it was too disparate. Therefore, the Tyrians were not confident that Macedonia could eventually defeat Persia.
