   Chapter 1286 Chalsidis' Suggestion
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Chalsidis thought for a moment and then said: "In addition, I learned a message from the Naucrates merchants who went to Cyprus for trade. They were recently expelled by the Cypriots. Their merchant ships are prohibited from entering the waters of Cyprus, and a large number of warships were often seen in the eastern waters of the island of Cyprus some time ago... After analysis, we believe that it is likely that the Persians concentrated most of the warships of their fleet in Cyprus. The eastern port..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos was still pondering after hearing this, and Matonis said loudly: "It seems that the Persians are gathering their navy and army to prepare for our attack from Egypt!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos did not make any decision. In response, he looked at Chalsidis again: "Next we will launch an attack on Persia. What suggestions do you have for this?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Chalsidis's expression became solemn. He considered it for a while before speaking softly. Said: "Your Majesty, the military plan to attack Persia from Egypt formulated by the Ministry of Military Affairs... I think it may need to be revised..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Oh?" Davos looked at the slightly nervous Chalcedis and tapped lightly with his hand. He knocked on the wooden chair and said in an encouraging tone: "None of us have experience fighting in Egypt. You are the most qualified to speak. Can you tell us in detail why you need to modify the plan?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos said, The other generals also became serious. When Davos motioned to Henepolis to place the wooden map of Egypt and Persia that he carried with the army in the center of the hall, they all gathered around.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, all the legion commanders!" Facing everyone's gaze, Chalcedis took a deep breath, pointed to the icon of Daphne City on the map, and although his voice trembled slightly, he said forcefully: "Daphne The city is a fortress built by the Egyptians in the easternmost part of the Nile Delta to defend against the invasion of the Persians. From the city of Daphne all the way east to the border of Egypt, it is about two hundred miles, and all the places it passes are There are no human settlements or any supply points in the desert. According to the marching speed of the kingdom's army in this terrain, it will take three to four days at the fastest to pass..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As he spoke, Chalcedis's words became Fluently, he traced the marching route on the map with his fingers, and finally stopped on a circular icon marked with the word "Gaza": "Less than twenty miles away from the Egyptian border is the fortress built by the Persians - Gaza City. , it is reported that there are usually 1,500 Persian soldiers stationed in the city, and now the number may increase to 4,000 -"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "4,000 is not many. Our army is going north, it should be easy to capture it." Lizaru, commander of the Second Army, interjected road.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I'm afraid it won't be easy." Chalcedis said solemnly: "Gaza City was originally just a forward supply town for the Persians to invade Egypt, but since the last time we reinforced Egypt and defeated the Persians, the Persians may be worried about us. They would attack them in turn through Egypt, so they recruited Jews and Phoenicians two years ago to build a fortress in Gaza. According to the information we have received, although the city is not large in area, it has high walls, thick walls, and reserves. Without sufficient military supplies, it is not easy to capture it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Moreover, the term 'Gaza' comes from the Canaanite language, which means that it is surrounded by sand. It is a fortress built on the gravel, and it is not far from it. The nearest Canaan oasis is at least twenty to thirty miles away, which means that we cannot obtain any resources from the vicinity of Gaza City to build large siege equipment such as siege towers, mobile towers, siege vehicles, or even build sieges. The platform and causeway are very difficult, because there is only sand there, no soil, and it is not easy to solidify, but these are not the biggest difficulties-"

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Chalcedis looked around the generals, and finally looked at Davos, emphasizing his tone. Said: "The thing that has the greatest impact on us is the desert! I once led the army to try to march eastward from Dafinay, and I experienced a lot of hardships! Marching in the desert, it was very hot during the day, windy and sandy, and the ground was soft. The soldiers Wearing armor, walking is very strenuous and easy to fatigue. Usually the legion marches normally, at least 50 miles a day, but marching in the desert in one day may not even cover half of the distance. And at night, the
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   desert becomes very cold, and the soldiers You can't sleep without wrapping yourself in a blanket. The guides said that fortunately it was spring. If it were summer, the entire desert would be like a big furnace. Few people would dare to walk on it. And there are only a few days left until summer here. It will only last more than three months..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I have led the legion here for 10 days, and I clearly feel that the climate in Egypt is much hotter than that in Magna Graecia. Is it because the weather is too hot that the Egyptian soldiers don't wear armor?" Melisander, commander of the Fourth Army, asked curiously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I have never asked the Egyptians this question." Chalsidis said in a deep voice: "Your Majesty and all the army commanders, please pay attention! If we want to lead the army through the desert and capture Gaza City, the biggest threat to us is water. !During this long march of nearly 400 miles, there was no water source. Soldiers were very prone to thirst when marching in the desert and needed to drink a lot of water. Even if we carried a lot of water when we set off, if we could not do it in a short time We have successfully captured Gaza, but we are still facing the danger of water shortage!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing Chalcides' words, the faces of the generals became solemn.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos even took a breath of cold air. He suddenly remembered that in the history of his previous life, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, established by the Crusades during the Western European Middle Ages, rashly gathered an army, entered the desert, and launched an attack on the Egyptian monarch Saladin. But because of the lack of water, they almost collapsed without a fight...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Gaza City is also built in the desert. Don't the Persians lack water?" Trotilas, commander of the Third Army, asked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "There should be wells dug in Gaza City, and there are not many Persian soldiers. Unlike our 200,000 soldiers, there are also a lot of labor, horses and livestock. Just digging a few wells cannot meet the demand. Not to mention the need It is very difficult to dig out groundwater in the desert and may not be successful." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   We may be able to march eastward along the coast and have the fleet accompanying us, which can dock at any time to provide us with water sources and other supplies... ..." Matonis said hesitantly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I have had this idea before, but after careful consideration, I found that this method is not appropriate, because to provide supplies for such a large army, it also requires a huge fleet, and maritime trade is underdeveloped. Egypt simply cannot provide enough supplies to meet the needs and can only recruit from mainland Greece and the kingdom. This takes a lot of time, and the more ships there are, the more crew members are needed, which itself will consume more supplies, plus The fleet docks every day to load and unload water, and the process takes a lot of time, which will seriously delay the army's marching speed and prolong the time it takes for us to pass through the desert..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Chalcides said this, pressing his finger on the map upwards Shift: "You should have noticed that the coast we are marching on is not too far from the island of Cyprus and the coast of Phoenicia. These two areas are the main naval bases of Persia and have a large number of warships. I have said before, The Persians may well have assembled their fleet in the naval ports of Cyprus, and they may well attack our fleet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And if we let the navy escort, but there are no ports on the long coast from Naukratis to Gaza to dock and replenish, the fleet will not get a good rest and the warships will not be maintained. When the Persian fleet attacks, We also need to consider protecting the fleet, and the entire war situation is not very favorable to our navy..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Chalcedis obviously thought carefully, and he patiently listed the difficulties one by one, and the legion commanders all frowned. , lost in thought.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos sighed and said: "It seems that the Ministry of Military Affairs and I have made the mistake of talking on paper and underestimated the difficulty of fighting in the desert. If you hadn't discovered it in time, Chalcedis, we would have You might get into a lot of trouble!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since you can find the problem, you must have come up with a solution to the problem. Tell us in detail how you want to modify the battle plan!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Facing Davos's encouraging gaze, Chalcedis cheered up and said loudly: "I think the first target we have to attack is not Gaza, but here - Cyprus!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone's eyes immediately focused on the icon on his finger.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "There are three purposes in attacking it.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Chalsidis explained the plan he had thought about: "First of all, Cyprus is a large island with large lakes and rivers, and a large plain in the north. It has a large population, sufficient food and material reserves, and more possessions." There are several well-equipped military ports, which are also easy to land and fight. As long as we capture them, we can use them to park our fleet and support our army's operations nearby.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Secondly, the island of Cyprus is a barrier to the coast of the Persian Near East. If we occupy it, we can land to the north and attack the Gulf of Issus, attack Syria and Phoenicia to the east, and threaten Canaan to the southeast...the coast of the entire Near East. are all under our threat, allowing us to take more initiative in the war-" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the island of Cyprus is so important to Persia, the Persians must also attach great importance to it. You also mentioned just now, Phoenicia Cyprus and Cyprus are the main sources of the Persian navy. They are also gathering their own warships. Looking at the map, Phoenicia is very close to Cyprus. They can send a fleet in time to intercept our transport fleet!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lizaru interrupted Chalcides and asked the question keenly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Chalcedis said calmly: "This is the third purpose I want to mention!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   We traveled thousands of miles to launch an attack on Persia. The long transportation line is the biggest weakness of our army, but as long as we control the dominance of the Eastern Mediterranean, this is not a problem. Therefore, this is taken into account in the military plan formulated by His Majesty and the Ministry of Military Affairs. The Persian fleet must be destroyed first, so the Greek coalition landed in Asia Minor first, trying to lure the Persian fleet north, but the effect was not ideal. In the end, only the Persian fleet in Asia Minor was annihilated, and the main force of the Persian fleet still stayed in the Near East waters!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But if we attack Cyprus, the Persian fleet will have to come out in full force, and I think this is what we should expect!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Having said this, Chalcedis looked at Davos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos crossed his arms and stared at the map, still thinking.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
