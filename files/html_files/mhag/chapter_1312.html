   Chapter 1312: Battle of Taposakus (4)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Persian archers withdrew a long distance before Arcinis gave the order to withdraw.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldiers retracted their long shields and stood up to take a look. They were stunned: the surrounding flat land was filled with arrows, and the same was true for the long shields, causing a sudden increase in weight.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order not to affect the use of the long shield, the soldiers immediately pulled out their short swords and cut off the arrow shafts on the shield.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, the Persian archery troops have retreated, and our casualties are not large!" After listening to the instant messages sent back by the messengers, Felicius reported to the king with a happy face.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos nodded calmly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Thirty years ago, we used this method to successfully defend against long-range attacks by Persian archers. Now our legionnaires have better defensive capabilities than we did then. The Persians still use the old method to deal with us. It is impossible to capture them. Any bargain!" Amyntas said disdainfully.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the pre-war military meeting, it was precisely because of the suggestions of the veterans that Davos decided not to use light infantry first, but to let the heavy infantry carry the Persian archery troops that were superior in long-range attacks in order to achieve the purpose of wearing down the opponent. , now it seems the plan was successful.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Davos looked at the Persian archers on the opposite side who were receding like a tide, and said lightly: "The appetizer has been eaten, and now it's time to have the main meal." The
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   mile-long distance made it difficult for the Persian king and Treba to Suss could not clearly see the casualties of the enemy on the opposite side, but Trebassus learned from the retreating generals that the results were not ideal, and he was suddenly shocked: first send Persian archery troops to fight. This was his proposal suggestion.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because through a detailed understanding of the battles in Asia Minor and referring to some past battles in Theonia, he found that the Theonian army was different from the Greek army. Their light infantry was not weak, and they liked to fight first in battles to disrupt The opponent's formation, that's why he made such a suggestion, hoping to use his powerful archery troops to cripple the opponent's light infantry and gain more advantages while also damaging the morale of the opponent's army. However, he did not expect that the opponent's light infantry would actually Did not go into battle, and the long-range attack on the Theonian heavy infantry did not achieve great results...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And when Trebasus came to Artaxerxes, his face no longer worried, but With joy: "Your Majesty, the attack of the bow and arrow troops caused a lot of casualties to the Theonian heavy infantry. We should take advantage of the victory to attack and not let the Theonian army take a breather!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Artaxerxes was greatly surprised after hearing this He was happy and said without hesitation: "Then continue the attack!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, my king!" Trebasus turned around and conveyed the order: "Chariots and war elephants attack!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The messenger galloped out, and some of them ran towards the center array. The frontmost part ran towards the left wing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Soon, Artaxerxes heard the high-pitched roar of an elephant from the front, and he was refreshed. He slapped the carriage and said excitedly: "Crush all the Theonians!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   50 big elephants Under the command of the mahout, the elephants spread out their thick limbs and began to move forward. Every step they took caused the ground to tremble slightly. While they were still accelerating slowly, the scythe chariots on both sides were already moving at full speed. The horses with flying hooves and the fast-turning wheels made a rumbling sound and stirred up the billowing dust mist. Although there were only more than 200 chariots, they created the momentum of thousands of troops, like roaring giant beasts, viciously They rushed towards the Theonia army formation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even legionnaires like Arcinis, who had been trained to deal with chariots during their stay in Egypt, could not help but feel nervous at this moment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, rapid footsteps sounded beside Alsinis. It turned out that the light infantrymen located behind the infantry array quickly passed through the passage between the detachment squares and ran to the front of the array.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, after the Theonian light infantry brigade learned the positions of the Persian chariots and war elephants on the opposite side, they planned their tactics in advance, so five thousand light infantrymen ran to the front of the formation and quickly formed a formation. , the harpooneer faces the elephant in the middle, and the archers face the chariot on both sides.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Without the need for an order from the team officer, the archers immediately drew their bows and fired arrows straight ahead after standing firm. Even though the chariot was still a hundred meters away, they shot straight instead of throwing arrows because they had conducted actual combat training in Egypt. They know that it is difficult for projectiles to hit a high-speed chariot. On the contrary, even if a direct shot is farther away, the rapid approach of the chariot will cause them to actively collide with the flying arrows.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The archers had just shot an arrow, and they immediately drew the arrow and shot again without caring about the result, because the time left for them was very tight.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Megakides, a Cretan, won the archery championship in the first Theonian Games last year and was invited by the Theonian Military Ministry. After repeated consideration, he finally decided to join the Theonians. Ya, with the special approval of King Davos, he only needs to serve in the military for three years before he can become a formal citizen.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After this news was deliberately publicized by the Turiyi City Hall, it aroused heated discussions among the people of all the allies. The athletes were gearing up and actively training, preparing to achieve excellent results in the 2nd Theonian Games in order to win Dai The Theonian Games are favored by the King of Onia, but the Theonian Games, like other Greek games, are also held every four years, and the time is still relatively long.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After immigrating to Thurii, Megakides temporarily lived in a military camp and while receiving military training, he also assisted military trainers in training and improving the archery skills of new recruits.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Light infantry, especially archers, rely more on personal skills. In the traditional Greek military formation, archers do not have any special tactics and rely more on their own personal skills. However, the Theonian army is different. The tactical ability requirements are relatively high. Megakides has only been in the military camp for half a year. He has just become familiar with light infantry tactics when he encountered this war. The Turiyi military camp originally did not want to recruit him, but in order to achieve military merit and become an official citizen as soon as possible , repeated requests.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Considering his amazing shooting skills, the captain of the light infantry of the First Legion recruited him as an ordinary soldier.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, Megakides followed his teammates and ran to the front of the array. When he saw the fast-moving chariot rushing through the dust and mist, charging towards them menacingly, the soldiers shot arrows in their hands.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although it was his first time to experience such a grand scene, he was born with a big heart, otherwise he would not have defeated many strong opponents at the first Theonian Games and won the archery championship. He did not release the arrow immediately, but quickly Calm your breathing, see the position of the chariot in front of you, take aim for a moment, and then release the bow string.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As the main weapon used by the Persian army to rush into battle, the Persians certainly knew that the target of the sickle chariot was too large and vulnerable to long-range attacks, so not only did the horses on the carts be covered with armor, but the crossbowmen and shooters on the vehicles were also Wear armor.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although many arrows hit the war horses, they were blocked by the armor and did not cause fatal injuries. On the contrary, under the eager whipping of the crossbowmen, they whined and accelerated forward.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, the arrow shot by Megakides penetrated the head of the horse that was not covered by armor. The galloping horse suddenly fell down, and the entire chariot turned upside down due to inertia. The crossbow on the vehicle The hand and the shooter were thrown into the air, screaming and smashing towards the place where Megakides was.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Megakides and his teammates hurriedly dodge.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Be careful! Chariot! Chariot!!..." The frightened shouts of the soldiers behind made Megakides hurriedly turned his head, only to see a chariot not far away that did not run straight forward, but rushed towards them sideways. Come.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The distance was already very close. Megakides rolled and crawled away, but some soldiers were unable to dodge. Unfortunately, one of his legs was struck by a flash of white light on the axle. He was immediately cut into several pieces and fell to the ground wailing. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The surrounding soldiers were all horrified when they saw this tragic scene.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Only then did Megacides realize that the chariot's driver and archer had all been struck by arrows and fell down.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When he and his teammates aimed their bows and arrows at the war horses, the two frightened horses seemed to sense the danger and ran back in panic with the chariot on their backs. There was a "bang" sound and they unexpectedly came face to face with one of their own chariots. Collide.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Amid the screams of the war horses, Megakides and the others heaved a sigh of relief.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Compared with their teammates who were standing still shooting arrows, the harpooneers in the light infantry brigade did not stop after rushing out of the array, but accelerated forward.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When they were only a few dozen meters away from the slowly running war elephant, they risked being shot by the archers on the back of the war elephant and threw their javelins with all their strength.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The skin of the war elephant is tough and thick, making it difficult for arrows to penetrate, so the Persians did not put armor on it. However, the Persians never expected that the Theonians, whom they despised, were not only not afraid of this behemoth, but also took the initiative to step forward. Fighting, dozens or hundreds of heavy javelins are concentrated to shoot at a war elephant, but it is enough to threaten the life of the war elephant.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For the Theonian light infantry, war elephants are large and slow, making them easier to deal with than running chariots.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The war elephants were quickly shot into hedgehogs.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although these war elephants have undergone specialized training, their gentle nature has not changed. Sensing the danger ahead, they turned around and ran back, completely disobeying the mahout's instructions.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Only a few elephants, mad with pain, accelerated forward, and then collapsed screaming as the harpooneers threw round after round.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the light infantry rushed up, the legionnaires did not relax their vigilance. Alcinis, the squad leader, even ran to the front and stared nervously at the battle ahead.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing a chariot in front breaking through the light infantry blockade and rushing straight towards the phalanx, he shouted eagerly: "Dodge! Dodge!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the Theonian army formation is a loose checkerboard array, there are enough There are gaps for soldiers to move around.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The galloping Persian chariot had difficulty turning due to inertia, and could only move along the passage quickly given up by the Theonian soldiers. The Theonian soldiers took the opportunity to attack the chariot with bayonets from both sides, killing the packhorses and drivers. .
