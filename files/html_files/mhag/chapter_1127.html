   Chapter 1127 The Persian Conspiracy
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pelopidas looked at Luticli again, and then said calmly: "On the other hand, you Spartans have never heard of you owning the entire Greece, but in recent years, whether it is China or You can be seen everywhere in Greece and Northern Greece sending troops to provoke wars. Our Thebes was once occupied by you, and the port of Piraeus in Athens was also innocently harmed by you. It seems that Sparta is the The biggest obstacle to the restoration of peace in Greece! Tamagoras, do you think I am right?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tamagoras was silent and did not respond.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Luticli wanted to refute excitedly, but Trebasus said loudly: "Sparta should indeed bear a lot of responsibility for the Greek wars in these years! The king gave Sparta a lot of support, but Sparta It is indeed a pity that Dar has betrayed the king's trust!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Having said this, Tribasus saw Luticli's livid face and secretly sneered in his heart: Vulgar, rude, stupid and incompetent Spartan barbarian!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If you were not still needed and the king's efforts over the years were not in vain, other Greek city-states would have united to destroy you!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just wait, I will settle the accounts with you Sparta one day!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "But the king believes that Sparta will definitely learn from the lessons of the past and shoulder the heavy responsibility of maintaining peace in Greece. Of course, this will also require the full assistance of other city-states such as Athens and Thebes! As for how you negotiate and sign a new peace treaty, we Persia will not intervene, but the king hopes that it will be best based on the previous contract. For any city-state that does not negotiate seriously, or even deliberately obstructs, and wants to continue the war, they will bear the wrath of the king, and Persia will use all its strength. The enemies who support it will be completely wiped out!!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The last few words, Trebasus said so loudly, shocked Pelopidas and others, feeling that the Persian king was serious about restoring peace to Greece. Very concerned.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Trebassus suddenly sighed and said: "The reason why the king cares so much about Greece is because you Greeks have few thalassemia, but you have always been able to compete with our powerful Persia. This makes him admire him very much! In his In his heart, he has always had this idea - the Greeks are the masters west of the Mediterranean.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But now the situation has changed. During the years when you had frequent wars, a man named Dai appeared in your colony - Magna Graecia. The country of Onia is like a monster. In just over 20 years, it not only conquered many foreign races, but also annexed many Greek states. Even Carthage became its Subordinate.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now, it has become the overlord of the sea area west of Greece. Next, it may turn its greedy mouth towards Greece, which is very close to it. If Greece does not end the dispute as soon as possible, unite and work together Resist this powerful enemy, and all that awaits you is destruction, just like the annexed city-states of Crotone, Locri, Catanai, and Syracuse! So the king hopes that you can reorganize after reaching peace. A new alliance to protect the security of Greece!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It can be said that the war in the Western Mediterranean that happened thousands of miles away a few years ago had nothing to do with Persia. However, the destruction of the East Phoenician fleet and the subsequent departure of Persian envoys to Theonia, The demand for an armistice was severely rejected. These two things greatly hurt the self-esteem of the Persian King Artaxerxes: Even the most unruly Sparta and Athens finally crawled at my feet, a little barbarian. How dare the kingdom be so arrogant!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   'What is it that the Western Mediterranean is the territory of Theonia? If Persia wants to intervene, send troops if you have the courage!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   '... This was the angry mood Artaxerxes felt when he heard the envoy's return and enriched his story.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Theonia is thousands of miles away and out of reach, Artaxerxes has always held a grudge, and now he finally found an opportunity to fight back against the Kingdom of Theonia who dared to offend his dignity.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After listening to Trebasus's words, the three envoys had slightly complicated expressions and thoughts in their minds.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I heard that in the Western Mediterranean War, the Persians sent a fleet to participate in the war, but suffered a disastrous defeat... It seems that this is true. No wonder the King of Persia received us so kindly this time and was so eager for us to reach peace!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However... it is in the interests of Athens and the requirements of the people to jointly resist a Theonia that is very aggressive in military and trade, but should we establish another alliance?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But if this alliance were to be dominated by Sparta again, would it harm Athens' interests again?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ... I'm afraid we have to go back and discuss these before we can make a decision... This is Tamagoras's idea.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Form an alliance to fight Theonia?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ... Lutikli felt a little complicated.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the Spartans had participated in the Persian expeditionary force, they had long noticed Theonia, which was founded by mercenary leaders, and knew more about Theonia than other Greek city-states. It gradually transformed from a weak city-state when it was founded. During the entire process of the powerful kingdom, Sparta had not used tricks and stumbling blocks to hinder its development, because they kept in mind the threats that King Theonia had said to them, so even if The peace agreement has been taking effect, and they are always worried about retaliation from Deolia, especially now that Sparta is deeply involved in the war in Thebes, so the Persian proposal is very popular with Lu. Tikli is tempted, because if it can be realized, it will undoubtedly give Sparta a guarantee of safety, but at the same time, he is also worried that the establishment of this alliance will really anger Theonia?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Can it really withstand a possible attack from Theonia?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After all, the Spartans knew somewhat about the strength of the Theonians.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pelopidas looked at Trebassus in surprise. He seemed to hear another meaning from the Persian king's favorite: Strange, the Persians seemed to be afraid of Theonia?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Is the strength of the Kingdom of Theonia really that strong?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
  ---
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He pondered for a moment and then asked: "Lord Trebasus, the advice from the King of Persia is very good, but I have a small problem."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What problem?" Trebasus looked at him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "As far as I know, Sparta has always had close ties with the Kingdom of Theonia you mentioned just now, and has signed a long-term alliance agreement. It is possible for such a city-state to lead the Greeks against Theonia. ?!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Shut your mouth! If you don't know, don't talk nonsense!" Lutikli interrupted him and emphasized loudly: "What Sparta and Theonia signed is mutual non-aggression. Treaty, in fact the relationship between Sparta and Australia is not good!..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The king is aware of these situations, so the king still proposes that Sparta lead the Greeks to defend against the possible invasion of Dioria, But in order to eliminate the doubts of other city-states, Sparta had better draw a clear line with Theonia as soon as possible and cut off contact!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Trebasus looked at Luticli coldly, then looked at the other two envoys, and said in a deep voice: "The king is very concerned about the security of Greece and will support you in restoring peace! He will also fully support you in forming an alliance to defend Dai Onia! But if any city-state is still provoking war or refusing to join the alliance, defend against the Theonians, or even secretly collude with them, then we in Persia will call on other Greek city-states to unite and destroy them! If Theonia really invaded Greece one day, and the king promised that he would assist the Greek alliance with a huge amount of wealth and supplies, as well as a powerful navy, to fully assist the Greeks in repelling this evil wolf in the west! ... "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   These categorical words of Trebasus not only contained a strong threat, but also showed the generous good intentions of Persia. The three Pelopidas were just envoys of the city-state and could not make a direct commitment to this, but only in their hearts. Calculating and weighing the pros and cons in order to return to the city-state and convince the people to make a certain choice, the three of them all remained silent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But for Trebassus, he had completely conveyed the intention of the Persian king to the three envoys, and the purpose had been achieved. He did not want to stay here with the Greeks any longer, so the banquet ended hastily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, after the three people returned to their rooms, the Athenian envoy Tamagoras, who had been the most silent at the banquet, quietly knocked on the door of the Spartan envoy. After seeing Luticli, he said sternly : "Athens and Sparta need to have a good talk..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before the three envoys left Persia, Artaxerxes met them again and reiterated his hope that Greece would restore peace and form an alliance to defend against Dionysus. After meeting Asia's expectations, he showed his generosity and gave generous rewards to the three envoys respectively. Among them, he also gave a corolla soaked in perfume that he always carried to the Spartan envoy Luticli. , and heard that the Athenian envoy Tamagoras loved to drink milk, and specially gave him a dozen good cows. Only he did not show anything special to Pelopidas, which was different from the three envoys he had received before. The performance is somewhat opposite.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, he summoned Luticli again alone, specifically mentioning the "friendly agreement signed between Sparta and Theonia", and reminded him seriously: Sparta must make peace with Theonia. Break off ties, or Persia will turn to support its enemy, Thebes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Due to the pressure exerted by the Persian king, Lutikli appeared to be preoccupied on the way back.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pelopidas was also uneasy. Even though the Persian king in Babylon had a good attitude towards him, he could feel that the Persians believed in and supported Sparta more, and they specifically mentioned that sentence in the previous meeting. , "Peace talks are best based on the King's Contract", which made him worried.
