   Chapter 1064 Reasons for refusing to send troops
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty." Ansitanos, who had been silent before, said first at this time: "The order established by the kingdom in central Italy is not yet very stable. The Etruscan League is the largest force allied with us. And they have been very friendly to us in the past few years. When they are in trouble, of course we should lend a helping hand.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What's more, the Gauls have always been a nightmare for various forces in central Italy, and their threat to the central region is increasing day by day. As the leader of the entire central region, our confrontation with the Gauls is inevitable, and we, Theonia, are trusted by other forces. main force.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The northern part of the Etruscan League is now very weak. If we have to wait until the Gauls invade the south before sending troops to rescue, I am afraid that by the time the army gathers, most of the Etruscan territory will have been lost. By then, not only the kingdom It will be resented by the Etruscans, and it will also reduce the trust of other forces in us. It will also seriously affect our construction in the Latium territory and make our military operations less smooth.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now that the Etruscan League has voluntarily provided such good conditions, we can help them keep the Gauls out of the mountains, kill their attempts to invade the south in advance, and ensure the security of the central part. Moreover, we can also acquire more land, completely bring the Etruscans into the kingdom's protective circle, and accelerate the kingdom's influence on them. This is a good thing that kills two birds with one stone, and we should not refuse it! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lord Ansitanos, we all understand what you are saying." Laphias, the Minister of Household Registration, objected: "But you should also understand that the Etruscans gave us part of their land in the hope that we would The people living there can work with them to resist the Gauls, but there they have to face harassment from the Gauls all the time and are in danger of losing their lives at any time, so which citizen is willing to move there?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Where are the prepared citizens and registered freemen?" Ansitanos asked seriously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Rafias shook his head and said: "Since the end of the last war, there is still a lot of vacant land in the entire kingdom that has not been distributed. This is a well-known fact. We do not give priority to the distribution of domestic land, but require these After finally accumulating enough merits and about to become new citizens, they went to Etruria to face the terrible Gauls. This was not only unfair, but also seriously damaged the credibility of the kingdom and affected our long-term execution. immigration action."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Rafias finished speaking, there was a moment of silence in the palace.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a while, Supervisory Minister Sesta said: "Why don't we send troops to directly attack the Gauls' territory, completely conquer the Gauls, and solve this big trouble once and for all?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Treasurer Alkibiades immediately said loudly: "The treasury is now tight, and there is not enough gold and silver to support a big war."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alexis also continued: "According to the information currently obtained, most of the northern half of Italy is basically occupied by the Gauls. Because there is a long river in its territory, its terrain is flat and the soil is fertile, making the Gauls Part-farming and part-grazing also support a large population. It is said that it is precisely because of the large population that they want to move south to occupy more land.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Moreover, there are continuous high mountains to the north where these Gauls live, and there are more Gauls to the north of the mountains... If our army crosses the Etruscan region and marches north, it will inevitably lead to a war of attrition. A long war. Now that the kingdom has just slowly recovered from the last war, it is not suitable to launch another major war in the short term. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Since the northern Etruscan region is full of dangers, we don't need to build towns on the land they assigned to us. We can build military fortresses similar to the Thurii Military Camp. The area can be smaller, and then send out legions in turn. The soldiers went to guard it, just like the Lahe Fortress." In addition to construction issues, Construction Minister Heraclides, who rarely spoke in other fields, rarely made his own suggestions because of the several renovations of the Thurii military camp. They are all designed by him and completed under his personal supervision. He believed that this kind of military fortress, which integrated military defense, town facilities and daily labor, could play a greater role on the Etruscan border.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lord Heraclid's proposal to build a military fortress in northern Etruria is indeed a good idea." Alexis first praised Heraclid, and then said cautiously: "However, sending legion soldiers there There, it is debatable to carry out rotational duty... Lahe Fortress is located in the heart of the kingdom. There is no danger. There are not many soldiers sent on duty. The rotation time is also very short. The supply of military food is also very convenient. The Ministry of Military Affairs will It is an experience that must be obtained before becoming a regular legionary reserve soldier, so the citizens have no objection to this. But when the legionnaires are sent to guard the northern border of Etrunia, the situation is completely different..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alexis cleared his throat and analyzed slowly: "First of all, the number of soldiers stationed in each military fortress built on the Etruscan border must not be a small number. Because they will face the generals They are fierce Gauls. The soldiers must not only defend the fortress, but also repel the small Gallic troops that harassed Etruria. At the same time, they must also consider the possibility of a sudden and large-scale southward invasion by the Gauls. The weak Etruscan army cannot be relied on, and they are far away from the kingdom and cannot receive strong support immediately. They must persist in defense for at least half a month before the kingdom's army comes to help. Therefore, the strength of each fortress At least it cannot be less than a thousand people to ensure safety.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The border between Etruria and the Gauls is very long. I am afraid that 3 to 5 such military fortresses will be needed to defend against Gallic attacks. This means that we must send at least 3,000-5,000 legionnaires. , this is 3/5 of a legion, which is no longer a small number, and the military food and materials it consumes are also not a small amount. Even if the Etruscans agree to provide free material assistance, in the long run, will they be able to persist? Go down, that's a problem. If we provide it ourselves, the cost will be even more, because the cost of traveling is also included...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Secondly, reinforcements to Etruria cannot be rotated frequently, because our army is stationed in northern Etruria, where both the opponents and the environment are completely unfamiliar to our army. It takes a long time to become familiar with an unfamiliar battlefield environment, understand the enemy's situation, understand the situation of friendly forces, and let the soldiers adapt to the battlefield life there... etc., and only after the generals and soldiers become familiar with it , they can fully exert their combat effectiveness. Otherwise, if the troops are rotated frequently and the soldiers are not familiar with or even unfamiliar with the surrounding environment, they may increase casualties or even cause failure during the battle. This is the "Dionysian Military Law" ã€‹Strictly prohibited! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alexis said this and glanced at Davos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos put his hand on his chin and nodded slightly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alexis continued without changing his expression: "Therefore, the time required for our troops to be stationed there cannot be too short, at least half a year. And let the soldiers be stationed for such a long time in an unfamiliar place where they are always facing battles. At that time, even the soldiers of the XIV Legion who were closest to there (that is, the legion that had just been formed a few years ago, camped near Rome, and came from the Latium region and parts of southern Etruria, mainly Caislera and Wei Ai) will also inevitably miss their hometown, which will lead to low morale.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What's more, these soldiers are still the main labor force in the family, tending farmland, grazing cattle and sheep, or doing other work to earn money to support the family. The kingdom allows them to serve for a long time. Although they may be given some rewards, they cannot fulfill their duties as citizens of Theonia. Other rights and obligations may still cause complaints from them and their families..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "During the Western Mediterranean War, the soldiers fought for more than a year. I think their performance was quite good and they had no complaints." Antaoris said disapprovingly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "That's because His Majesty personally led the army and always paid attention to adjusting the soldiers' war-weariness." Alexis said this not to compliment Davos. He explained seriously: "Back then, our army was fighting against Rome. After the fierce battle, His Majesty held several competitions and banquets to invigorate the atmosphere in the military camp. When going south to Sicily to fight the Carthaginians, the main force still avoided direct decisive battles with them and mainly trained, repaired and defended themselves in the camps and cities. , coupled with the huge honor of defeating Carthage, the original hegemon of the Western Mediterranean, inspired them, so they were able to persist until the end.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But if they are allowed to go to the northern border of Etruria, the commanders of the various fortresses cannot have great prestige and charisma, allowing the soldiers to maintain high morale, and we can recognize that helping the Etruscan alliance Regarding the importance of maintaining the security of the kingdom, the soldiers may not think so deeply. On the contrary, they will think that it is meaningless to fight for a force that has little to do with them for a long time, which will cause them to lose any desire to fight. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Having said this, he coughed and said with emphasis: "What's more, as long as we are not ready to conquer the Gauls in the north, helping the Etruscan Alliance and defending the northern border may be a long-term task. , one year, two years, three years... If this continues, I am afraid that the soldiers of the various legions of Dionysia will be full of complaints, and even refuse to obey orders and go to Etruria..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alexis made the situation so serious that it caused a commotion among the people around him.

   It's been snowing in Beijing these past two weeks. I accidentally caught a cold. What should I do? !
