   "Every time I talk to you, it always helps me relieve a lot of worries." Pelopidas said half-jokingly and half-seriously: "I won't talk to you anymore. Next I will We still have to visit other congressmen... By the way, we should let the Theonians know how much pressure we have endured and how much effort we have made to maintain this alliance. It is best if you quietly send someone to the United States tomorrow. Senia, let the Theonians know about this and make preparations in advance."

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Okay, leave it to me to send people." After Ipamilonda sent Pelopidas out the door, he returned to the study , looking at the floor plan of the Theonia military camp drawn on the papyrus, he picked up the pen again, but his thoughts were too chaotic and he could not calm down to write for a while. He subconsciously tapped the word "Theonia" on the paper with the tip of his pen. , there is only one thing in mind: no matter how beautiful Pelopidas's conception is, it first depends on whether Theonia can completely defeat the Spartans as soon as possible

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   These days, First Fleet Commander Sekerian is in a very bad mood, and it is not because of the new army commander Crotokartax, even though he had just When he arrived, Sekerian did not go to greet him out of the reserve of a veteran. However, on the second day, His Royal Highness the Prince personally visited the First Fleet camp near the coast and paid a very respectful courtesy to Sekerian. In the end, Sekerian was moved, and he took the initiative to make a promise: he was willing to lead the fleet to fully cooperate with the army in operations.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reason why Sekerian was unhappy was that although he had occupied the island of Kythera in the Gulf of Laconia and completely blockaded the coast of Sparta, mercenaries recruited by Sparta from outside the mainland still landed. The Peloponnese was conquered, making it more difficult for the army to conquer Sparta.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although this is not the fault of the First Fleet, and before Sekerian left Thurii, Davos once told him: After the First Fleet arrives in the waters south of the Peloponnese, try not to cross Lagogni. Asia Gulf, patrolling the east coast of the Peloponnese and even the waters further north to avoid causing dissatisfaction with coastal city-states such as Argos, Corinth, and even Athens.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sekerian has been strictly following the teachings of King Davos, but he did not expect that the cunning Spartans not only allowed mercenaries to land at the Corinth port, but also frequently had grain ships entering the Corinth port in the past few days. With enough mercenaries and a steady supply of military rations, the Spartans had the confidence to continue fighting the Theonian army...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just as Sekerian was sitting in the military tent sulking, the staff officer Entering the tent: "Your Majesty Commander, I just received a report from the clipper ship and found that there were 5 cargo ships full of soldiers heading to the Isthmus of Corinth."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sekerian stood up suddenly: "Where were they found? ?Which city-state's ship is it?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It should be near Naxos (not Naxos in Sicily, but an island in the Aegean Sea). It is estimated that it has entered the port of Corinth now. As usual, this Several cargo ships are flying the flags of Miletus, Samos, Ephesus, Halicarnassus and other Greek city-states in Asia Minor." the staff officer replied slightly angrily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Bang!" Sekerian kicked the seat over. His face was as cold as frost, and he paced quickly in the tent, but his hands were clenched into fists.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Suddenly he stopped and shouted like thunder: "Order the crew to push the ship into the sea and prepare to sail!" The
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   staff officer immediately understood his intention and hurriedly advised: "Commander, please calm down! His Majesty Davos is An order was given -"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "That's not an order, it's just a reminder, and His Majesty used the word 'try your best'!" Sekerian said emotionally: "We didn't want to conflict with these city-states, but these Greek city-states But they colluded with the Persians, took advantage of our forbearance, and continued to transport food to the Spartans. Now they are transporting soldiers to Sparta again. If this continues, our war with Sparta will become very difficult. , this will cause huge losses to the interests of the kingdom, so our navy can no longer stand by and must take action!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this point, he softened his tone: "You are still young and not familiar with His Majesty's style. He never gives The generals who led the army on the expedition issued a fatal order, but allowed them to independently formulate combat plans based on the actual situation on the battlefield. Now is the time for us to change our combat strategy!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sir, I understand." The staff officer quickly accepted. After understanding Sekerian's point of view, he was actually holding back a belly of anger: "Which squadron are you going to send?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sekerian answered decisively: "All the warships of the First Fleet!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " The entire First Fleet?!" The staff officer was greatly surprised: The First Fleet had more than 500 warships, just to sink a few troop and grain transport ships, it was simply killing a chicken with a knife.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sekerian saw through his mind and said in a deep voice: "This time we not only want to capture or sink all the ships transporting food and troops to the port of Corinth, but also beat them thoroughly so that they will never dare to help again in the future. Spartans! At the same time, this is also an armed voyage of our Theonian First Fleet into the Aegean Sea, showing our powerful power to those Greek city-states, and making those city-states who want to go against us reconsider whether they Have this ability!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes! I will immediately notify the entire fleet to prepare for sailing!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   More than an hour later, Sekerian boarded his flagship, raised the sailing flag, and the bugle was blown, except Two fleets of 50 warships anchored on the island of Kythera were to blockade the coast of Sparta. (After the Western Mediterranean War, under the instructions of Davos, the Ministry of War made some adjustments to the navy. Not only did the four major fleets become three major fleets, but the organization of the fleet was also changed. It was clearly stipulated that the squadron had 100 warships and was composed of 4 columns. Each column had 25 warships. Therefore, the warship column became All the remaining warships, about 500 of them (the smallest unit of the Theonian Navy), were arranged in four columns and sailed eastwards in a mighty way.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the fleet rounded the cape and turned around to head north, Sekerian issued another order: In view of the large number of islands in this area, the fleet was not familiar with the sea conditions here, so it slowed down and moved along the east coast.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After giving the order, Sekerian returned to his seat to rest.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the Western Mediterranean War, the Ministry of Military Affairs discussed the issue of "whether the flagships of each fleet need to be redesigned and improved" with the fleet commanders and shipbuilding engineers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Some people proposed that "the Carthaginian double-headed dragon warship could be used as a model to build the flagship of the fleet"; others suggested that "the former Carthage four-layered oar warship could be improved and used as the flagship of the fleet"...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sekerian proposed Opposition: Whether it is a double-headed dragon ship or a four-level oar warship, they are too clumsy and bloated. The naval generals will never let one ship slow down the entire fleet and affect the combat just because they are greedy for enjoyment. efficiency……
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sekerian's opinion was supported by Midorades, the commander of the 2nd Fleet, and Stefankas, the commander of the Third Fleet. In the end, the matter of changing the flagship was dropped.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Apart from its slightly larger hull and taller mast, Sekerian's flagship was not much different from the Raven Warship.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The place where Sekerian was sitting was at the stern of the ship. The stern of the warship was tilted up like a scorpion's tail, forming a pocket with a wooden chair inside. Since the top could block the sun, he was relatively comfortable sitting in it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sekerian held the handle of the wooden chair with both hands and looked outside the warship: the water here was exceptionally blue, and the wind and waves were very small, so the warship sailed very smoothly. Turning to the left, he saw rugged rocks on the coast not far away. The peaks stand tall, and since it is the perfect time of spring, the cliffs are full of green trees and red flowers, which is pleasing to the eye. Looking up at the sky, white clouds float leisurely in the clear sky, and from time to time, groups of seabirds sing and pass by. , the cold water carried by the gentle sea breeze gently brushed over the face, which was refreshing...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While Sekerian was enjoying a rare moment of comfort, the residents on the shore were very frightened.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This coast is still the territory of Sparta. Although most of it is cliffs, there are still some small seaside villages and towns.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Wars have been frequent in recent years, and people in villages and towns here often see fleets passing by in the nearby waters, either ships from Athens and its allies, or fleets from the Peloponnesian League, but they have never seen such a terrifying scene: Countless warships boundlessly covered most of the sea they could see. Each ship was as black as ink, seeming to dye the blue water into black...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As they ran north along the coast in panic , when he was about to inform the people in Sparta of this shocking news, the forward of this black fleet had already turned to the northeast.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After bypassing the peninsula to the east of the Argos territory, the 1st Fleet entered a large bay-Salon Bay. It was like entering an extremely lively town from a sparsely populated countryside, with hundreds of thousands of people everywhere. Ships loaded with cargo entered and left this large bay. Most of them sailed to Athens in the north, some to Corinth in the east, and a very small number of them sailed to Megara in the southeast. Even during the war, This happened every day during this period, so it became one of the most prosperous bays in the Mediterranean a long time ago.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But at this moment, the first fleet of Theonia was like a hungry wolf breaking into the flock of sheep. It made the chickens and dogs jump for a while, and the panicked ships fled one after another. It didn't take long for the extremely lively bay to become a lot quieter again. , no other ships appeared around the First Fleet warship.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The captains of the 1st Fleet obviously did not care about such changes. According to their prior plan, they turned the warships eastward and penetrated deep into the bay.
