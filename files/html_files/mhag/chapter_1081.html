   "I think Patroclus will make more use of the 500 mountain reconnaissance brigade soldiers in his hands. They are the key to the decisive victory."

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The officers watching the battle were talking quietly. , the two protagonists on the field were still staring at the map, thinking hard.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Tormid said again: "I announce that the tactical assessment has officially begun!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Dang!" A crisp bell rang, and the two protagonists stood up at the same time and took a few steps back. Ten soldiers carried several pieces of bread. The wooden boards entered the field and were erected on the wooden map respectively, blocking the two people from seeing the whole map. Of course, Sextus had the advantage of defense. The map range he could see was larger, and Patroclus' The line of sight is limited to the southwest corner of the map.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Several tactical executors also stood next to the two protagonists holding tactical chess pieces. These tactical chess pieces were small wooden sculptures such as heavy infantry, light infantry, javelinmen, and cavalry. When they were placed on the map, they made serious people look at them. The tactical assessment has a bit of game fun.

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Matonis picked up two dice and threw a "7". After the referees picked up the form for comparison, they loudly said: "Day 1, heavy rain!" After
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   hearing this, the two protagonists passed by After thinking, they used a white pen to write down the measures they took on the first day on the small wooden boards they carried with them, and then the executors took their wooden boards to the referee's seat.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The referees read the order on the board and ruled it feasible.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So, the executor followed the orders on the board and began to place tactical chess pieces on the map.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Matonis rolled the die again, then glanced at Patroclus and said loudly: "Heavy rain on the second day!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There was a small commotion among the surrounding officers watching the battle, but Patroclus's expression did not change. After thinking about it, write down your decision again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While most of the officers in the Turiyi military camp gathered in the tactical drill room to watch the two men conduct assessments, King Davos made a speech to the Minister of Military Affairs, A. Accompanied by Lexis, they arrived at the Turiyi military camp.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After receiving the news, Leotychides, the commander of the First Army, rushed to greet him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After learning that a tactical assessment was being conducted in the military camp, Davos asked Leotychides not to inform them for the time being, and he took the guards to the military conference room to wait.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Proseus, which one of them do you think will win?" Davos chatted with Leotychides while they were free.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Patroclus has a flexible mind and decisive and bold actions; Sextus is careful, steady and calm. Both of them are excellent officers. According to the information I have received, in this assessment, Sextus Stus is in charge of defense and Patroclus is in charge of offense. This distribution is in line with their fighting style. However, when fighting in mountainous areas, defense has an advantage. If Patroclus wants to win, I am afraid he will need a little luck." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Yes, In war, luck is an important factor in determining victory or defeat, and it has to be decided by the gods. But in assessments, it depends on the luck of the dice referee..." Davos said jokingly, and then Changing the topic: "What do you think about whether to send legions to the border to build fortress defenses this time?" "Your Majesty
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   , I think there is no problem in sending legions to take turns to station at the border for more than half a year. In fact, each legion is stationed at the border. The stay was not too long, and there were nearly 20 legions in the kingdom. It would take at least a few years for them to take another turn. Besides, these legionnaires had multiple slaves at home, and their families had enough labor to take care of the housework... ..." Leotychides replied without hesitation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Henepolis curled his lips and cursed in his heart: Of course you, Proseus, would say that. In your eyes, is there anything else besides military affairs?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ever since you became the commander of the First Army, the citizens of the entire Turiyi Region have been complaining about your harassment, and they have nicknamed you "Iron Man"...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos actually listened carefully. He nodded from time to time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two chatted for a while, and Davos seemed to remember something and asked: "Proseus, you haven't been back home in the past six months, have you?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leotychides was stunned, and then replied: " Your Majesty, I have just taken over the First Legion and want to get familiar with this legion as soon as possible, so..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos waved his hand and persuaded with concern: "Don't be too anxious. Judging from the current situation, the kingdom will not be in a short period of time. If there is a big war, the First Army will not be sent to the battlefield in a short time. You have plenty of time to get familiar with the First Army. You still have to take time to go back and spend time with your family! Your home is in the city of Thurii , not far apart, yet you haven't even visited once in half a year. Your family has all gone to the Ministry of Military Affairs! Those who don't know the situation might think that it was me, Davos, who imprisoned you here. I don't want to suffer this injustice. Ah!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos said jokingly, then patted Leotychides on the shoulder, and said in a gentle but irresistible tone: "Go home and rest for a few days tomorrow, and take it easy. Relax yourself and let the soldiers relax, okay?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leotychides hesitated for a while, then reluctantly said: "Yes, Your Majesty."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "That's right, you must know how to combine work and rest! "Davos laughed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The corners of Henepolis's mouth curled up slightly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While the two were talking, the palace guard chief Martius walked into the military conference room: "Your Majesty, the tactical assessment is over."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Who won?" Henepolis asked curiously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Sextus won." Martius reported to the equally curious Davos: "Patroclus had bad luck. It rained heavily for several days before the battle began, which prevented his army from crossing the river. , but he still insisted on having the engineering camp build the bridge and attract Sextus' army to block it on the other side. However, he secretly divided some troops to build rafts on the upper reaches of the river and took the risk of forcibly crossing the river.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Sextus arranged various arrangements The young sentinel monitored the upper river bank and discovered this situation, and he quickly sent an army to stop it, but the referee's bench ruled that Sextus' army could not arrive in time due to distance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Patroclus' army successfully crossed the river, many soldiers drowned due to the swollen river water.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sextus decisively led the army to retreat back to the mountains. Patroclus immediately established a defensive camp on the other side of the river, and it took several days for the entire army to cross the river.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the process of marching towards the mountains, his army was constantly harassed by the Samnite light infantry sent by Sextus, which slowed down their advance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sextus used this time to build a simple defensive fortress on a dangerous terrain on the only way, and hoarded heavy troops.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two sides launched a fierce offensive and defensive battle here. Due to the narrow mountain road, Patroclus' superior force could not be fully deployed. Moreover, at the critical moment, heavy rain was thrown many times, seriously affecting Patroclus's attack, so the time When it ended, his army still failed to break through the blockade.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, he secretly sent 1,000 soldiers, mainly composed of mountain reconnaissance soldiers, to sneak attack the main camp of Sextus' army by climbing mountains and going around trails. However, because Sextus' main force was still there, Patlock Rose's rations had been exhausted, so the referee's bench finally ruled that Sextus won... However, based on the performance of both sides, the referees unanimously ruled that both of them passed the tactical assessment.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Davos
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   listened carefully, he said with emotion: "Although it was just talk on paper, it also made them realize the difficulty of fighting in the mountainous area!"
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ...However, since this tactical assessment is based on the Samonai Mountains, have the judges considered that sending troops to fight should avoid the spring rainy season?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I asked Tormid, and he said that the combat time was set in summer. Therefore, when designing the form, only two of the 12 weather options were related to rain, namely light rain and heavy rain. But it happened to be during the assessment. The worst hit among multiple hits.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Martius finished speaking, Davos was also a little surprised. After a moment, he shrugged and said: "This just shows that the vagaries of war are beyond our control. I think today's tactical assessment is very good, very good. Well, I taught them a lesson..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As Davos was talking, noisy footsteps were heard outside the door.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos stopped talking, took his exclusive helmet from Henipolis, and put it on On his head.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alexis, the Minister of Military Affairs, led Chief of Staff Tormid, Commander of the Second Army Matonis and other generals into the conference room. After saluting Davos respectfully, they stood to the side one after another.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then Patroclus and Sextus came in. They already knew what was going to happen next, so they looked very excited. After paying a military salute to Davos, they stood upright.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos He looked around the room, and then said solemnly: "Let's get started.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Military Minister Alexis took a step forward, unfolded the papyrus scroll tied with a black cloth strip in his hand, and read aloud: "In view of the fact that Patroclus and Sextus have outstanding military exploits in the past and passed with excellent results. After the general assessment, His Majesty King Davos and the Ministry of Military Affairs discussed and decided to promote the two people to legion commanders!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as his voice paused, cheers rang out around him, and Patroclus also had smiles on their nervous faces.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alexis continued: "And Patroclus was appointed commander of the Fourteenth Legion (mainly (Latium region), Sextus took office as commander of the 18th legion (southern Iberia region), and went to take office immediately without delay!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Felicius and the others on the side were a little surprised: it is reasonable for the two of them to be promoted to legion commanders, but it is rare in recent years to be given practical duties immediately after promotion!
