   Chapter 1111 When the Holy Kingdom of Theonia
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   heard this, Okriton immediately wanted to refute, but Haka raised his voice again and said sternly: "Now, the Magonid family has paid a heavy price for that war. The price, and have you Hannon faction been punished?! At least not yet!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Especially after Aisyaruba died of illness, you Hannon faction have completely controlled the Senate, and many neutral senators had to switch to you, Just the year before last, you actually called that man 'The Great Hanno'! What a ridiculous thing! A man who was the culprit who caused the defeat of the war, a sinner who reduced the once powerful Carthage to an ordinary city-state that is now a mere city-state, actually has the face to do so. Call yourself 'The Great'!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hakkar laughed contemptuously, and Okriton remained silent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka looked at him and said in a deep voice: "It seems that you still have objections to Hanno's shameless behavior. Now the gods have given me the right to make those who have done wrong things receive the punishment they deserve! I said But you are lucky to have met me! If my brother Hasdrubal were here, he would like to kill all the senators of Carthage in order to relieve the anger of his defeat; if Dido is here, She always believed that all the people of Carthage could not escape responsibility for her father Mago's death in battle, and she wished that everyone would be punished!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this point, Haka paused intentionally.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Okriton heard this, he was indeed very worried: he didn't think Hakkar was trying to scare him. Dido and Hasdrubal were both important members of the Magonid family, and Okriton certainly treated her very well. The two have had an in-depth understanding, and the revenge they may have carried out against Carthage is indeed in line with their personalities. Even though they are not in Thurii now, one has become the commander of the Theonian Army and regained possession of it. The other has the power to lead troops, and the other is the only prince and concubine of the Theonia royal family today. She also gave birth to two little princes, so she will naturally be loved and cared for by the royal family. If they have always had hatred for Carthage, this is indeed a problem. Terrible things.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "And I -" Haka said firmly: "I only ask the Carthage Senate to send the main leaders of the Hanno faction like Hanno, Typanlaco... and other people and their families to If we expel Carthage and let them experience the pain we endured, then I can guarantee that the grievances between our brothers and sisters and the Carthage people will be wiped out! By the way, these people do not include you, because Your Majesty feels that you are still Not bad."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Okriton was not happy because he was able to escape punishment, but said solemnly: "I'm sorry, but it is impossible for the Carthage Senate to expel several high-prestige people just because of your threats. The senators - "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "They will!" Haka said confidently: "When all the people of Carthage discovered that the attacks of the Eastern Numibians were becoming more and more frequent, and the Carthaginian merchants were unable to enter the Kingdom of Theonia. When they are conducting trade within the territory and with their allies, and when they know that all this is caused by the Hannonites, do you think they will collectively protest to the Senate to drive out these bad apples? Just like when they collectively protested against our horse Just like the Goned family!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the water in the pool is getting hotter and hotter, Okriton's heart is getting colder and colder. He makes the final struggle sternly and internally: "You...your actions are a violation of the peace agreement. "..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I did not violate it." Haka looked at him confidently: "As long as Carthage expels people like Hanno and joins the Kingdom of Theonia, I can guarantee you that the Carthage people will live a better life in the future. The past was better, and this is what our family wants to see!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a diplomatic elder of the Carthage Senate, Okriton felt for the first time that he was so powerless and that everything was out of his control. , which made him feel very flustered. He lowered his head, looked at the steaming water in front of him, and whispered: "After meeting King Davos, I will consider these suggestions of yours."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka chuckled. He said: "Master Okriton, don't you understand? Your Majesty will not see you at all. He has given me full power to handle Carthage's foreign affairs."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Okriton was shocked and looked at it again There was despair in Xiang Haka's eyes, but more of a plea. He opened his mouth with difficulty, but said nothing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka showed a sympathetic look and said softly: "I know it is difficult for you to make these decisions, but no matter how difficult it is, in order to allow the Carthaginians to survive better, and for your family To be able to continue living in the land you are familiar with, you must make a decision as soon as possible, because time waits for no one. As soon as September passes, the north wind that represents the arrival of cold winter will blow..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Okriton felt suddenly in his heart .
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was cold.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Watching Okriton leave in despair, Haka felt an indescribable joy in his heart. He poured himself another glass of wine, raised it high, and said sincerely: "Thank you, Your Majesty, for giving me a revenge." Opportunity!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After saying that, he drank it all in one gulp.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the next two days, Okriton was still trying hard to get an opportunity to meet King Davos through various channels, but to no avail. Undoubtedly a failure.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the celebration was about to begin, he had no intention of staying in Thurii. He anxiously took a boat back to Carthage and began to secretly discuss countermeasures with others.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On September 9th, the Hades celebration begins.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   People from various towns in the kingdom crowded on both sides of the main road in Thurii City, sending flowers and cheers to the soldiers who were marching from the northern military camp to Victory Square for review. They were from various legions, fleets, and The outstanding soldiers and officers selected from the cavalry, who had participated in many battles and made military exploits, proudly held the flags of their legions and companies and passed through the three triumphal arches of Thurii one after another.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The most important battle scenes of the Crotone War, the South Italian War, and the Western Mediterranean War are respectively carved on the Arc de Triomphe. They also represent the three most critical moments that Theonia has experienced since its establishment: the battle to establish the alliance, The battle to found a country and the battle to become a powerful nation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Parades composed of legionnaires passed under them one after another, which means that it was this powerful army formed by citizens that enabled Theonia to grow from weak to strong and eventually become a powerful kingdom.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Behind the army followed a parade composed of people from more than a dozen regions in the kingdom. Compared with the uniform soldiers, their queue was very loose, but more lively. They excitedly interacted enthusiastically with the people on the street, which made The atmosphere of the celebration became more lively and joyful.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The entire game team walked into the Victory Square with colorful flags flying and cheers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the podium in front of the Senate Chamber, Davos led the kingdom's ministers and main senators, dressed in costumes, standing upright, and watched with a smile as the teams passed by the stage.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the viewing platforms on both sides, the invited allies, friendly envoys and distinguished guests witnessed this unprecedented grand celebration with different expressions: some were sincerely happy for Theonia, such as the Volscians, Hercules and others. The Erniki people, etc.; some are grateful that they were able to join the Theonian League in time, such as the Etruscans, the Samnites, etc.; some are worried and scared, such as the Sidisthenes, etc.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After all, when the entire parade filled Victory Square, and there were also dense crowds of spectators around the square, the center of Turiyi completely turned into a sea of ​​​​people, with a total of 78,000 people, more than a city-state, and The number of people in a large race is equivalent, and this is just a drop in the bucket of the huge population of the Kingdom of Theonia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The square was filled with people and it was suffocating.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But when Davos walked to the front of the podium, silence quickly returned to the square inside and outside. Only the voices of Davos and the announcer echoed over the square:
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Citizens of the Kingdom of Theonia, today we gather in Here is a celebration to worship Hades. In the past 20 years since the establishment of Theonia, we have encountered many difficulties and setbacks, but under the blessing of Hades and our concerted efforts Under this, we have passed one difficulty after another.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Today we can stand up and declare to the whole world that Theonia has become a powerful kingdom. Not only are we not afraid of any enemy's challenge, but we will also fight for any enemy. We want countries and forces that are friendly with us to provide support and protection!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The god Hades was very satisfied with all the achievements of Theonia. He sent an oracle, not only will he continue to protect the people of the kingdom, but also allow The name of the Kingdom of Deolia bears a sacred name. Any enemy who dares to offend the kingdom will be directly violating the territory of this great god and will be punished and cursed by him!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Citizens, thank the great Hades Go! Cheer for the Holy Kingdom of Theonia!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as Davos finished speaking, cheers like mountains and tsunamis erupted inside and outside the square: "The merciful Hades is victorious!!!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The Holy Kingdom of Theonia Victory!!!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Every citizen who raised his arms and raised his arms was filled with a kind of fanaticism. From then on, they firmly believed that they would have something to support them in life and death, and no longer feared any dangers and difficulties, because they had already They are the earthly people of that great God.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the frenzied atmosphere, the patrol officers who maintained order began to arrange for the parade to gradually withdraw.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then the large-scale drama performances began, "The Birth of Pluto", "The Establishment of Theonia"... one after another traditional kingdom dramas were performed in the square.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The actors in the square performed very hard, and the audience outside the venue also watched with extreme concentration, bursting into applause and cheers from time to time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the last play "Battle in Sicily" came to an end, the sun had already risen to the middle of the sky.
