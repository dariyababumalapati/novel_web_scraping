   Chapter 1171 Confident Agesilaus
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus was not surprised. The reason why he led his army at this time was because he had received a report from the messenger sent by Archidamus to Sparta. , now the situation has only become more serious. He thought for a while and asked: "How many more days can the food stored in the camp be supplied?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If you include the troops you brought -"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Don't count it yet. After getting the news from you, I asked the soldiers to bring five days of food rations." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It can probably supply seven days, so I sent people to collect food in Taigea's territory these two days. Unfortunately, Taigea The Geyan people have long since hid in the city, and we have not harvested much."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Immediately stop collecting grain from the Tegeyan territory, and at the same time prohibit anyone from destroying the Tegeyan people's villages and fields, or robbing their houses. Property!" Agesilaus said in a stern tone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Father, why do you do this?! We trusted the Tegeans so much, but they betrayed us. We must severely punish them and let the city-states in the Peloponnese know that betraying Sparta What kind of fate will there be!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus looked at Archidamus who looked puzzled, and sighed secretly in his heart: This son of his was brave in battle and good at making friends, and he had a lot of influence among the Spartan people. Although he has a great reputation, he has one biggest shortcoming - he is unwilling to use his brain more, is not precise enough in doing things, and does not look at problems comprehensively enough.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, this was also a common problem among most Spartan citizens.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sparta could do this when it was strong, but when the people rebelled and strong enemies invaded, doing so would not only fail to deter them, but would have the opposite effect.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, Agesilaus understood his son's stubborn personality, and he did not intend to persuade him with words, but let the later facts give him a deep impression, so he said in a tone that could not be refused: "This is an order!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Archidamus was almost 40 years old and had led troops to fight independently many times, he still showed awe in the face of his old father. He did not express his objection clearly, but reminded: "Those mercenaries may not accept it.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This order."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "They will accept it!" Agesilaus said firmly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Archidamus could not say anything more on this issue, so he brought up another matter: "Father, the elders should have met the messengers from Corinth, right? Regarding their suggestions, the censors and the council of elders What's the decision?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus said unhurriedly: "Although the Corinthians have always been cunning and capricious, and they once brought disaster to us Sparta (referring to the Corinthian War), after fighting with Thebes They almost remained neutral in the war, but the Council of Elders was still willing to believe the words of the Corinthians, not only because, as the Corinthian envoy said, the Theonian fleet raided their port and gave them great humiliation, and they wanted revenge. .' Also because Theonia has seriously harmed the interests of the Corinthians, they have long held a grudge -" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Wait... Theonia has harmed the interests of Corinth, what interests?" Archidamus endured He kept interjecting.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing his son's puzzled expression, Agesilaus covered his forehead with his hand, but he still explained patiently: "Our fundamental interests of Sparta are in the Peloponnese, and the fundamental interests of the Athenians are The Aegean Sea, and the Corinthians developed westward very early. They had many colonies in the Western Mediterranean, including the well-known Kercyra and Syracuse. Relying on trade with these colonies, they were once very Wealthy, but now...hehe..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Archidamus suddenly realized: Theonia annexed all the city-states in Magna Graecia, which made Corinth resentful. No wonder they would so easily agree to open the port on the eastern isthmus and allow We transport troops and food...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The Corinthian envoy said that they will unite all the Greek city-states to fight against Theonia, and we believe they can do it. The Corinthians are not good at fighting, but they are quite good at this... "When Agesilaus said this, he was not sarcastic like other Spartans, but rather with a bit of admiration.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He still clearly remembered: when he was still a young man and the Peloponnesian War had been going on for almost 10 years, Sparta encountered a crisis. Not only did Sparta suffer a disastrous defeat in both naval and land battles, but the helots in the country also suffered a heavy defeat. With continuous defections, Sparta's prestige was greatly lost. They were troubled by domestic affairs alone, let alone sending troops to fight.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   To make matters worse, the alliance between Sparta and Argos expired. Argos refused to renew the agreement and instead formed an alliance with Athens. The Peloponnesian League also faced fragmentation, especially Mantinia and Elys. He has his own interests and conflicts with Sparta.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a result, Sparta's power was severely weakened and it was forced to sign the "Nicias Contract" with Athens. However, because Sparta did not strictly implement the contract, the war may break out again at any time, and the Argos are also ready to make a move. Da is facing a huge crisis.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, the Corinthians stood up and performed some magical diplomatic operations, which not only stabilized the Peloponnesian League, but also prevented Athens and Argos from cooperating well. Instead, a gap was created, making Sparta overcame this difficulty and finally won the war...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus breathed out lightly, blew away the past, and said seriously: "Theonia is a force in the Western Mediterranean, 20 Over the years, it has risen by annexing our colonial city-states in Greece. Not only is it somewhat unfamiliar to these local city-states, but it also has more or less conflicts of interest.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now this outsider not only sends troops to the Peloponnese Rampant on the land, their fleets are still cruising in the Aegean Sea at will, which will inevitably make many city-states feel angry and threatened. Therefore, the Council of Elders analyzed that Corinth wants to form a temporary alliance against Theonia, which should be able to It can be done."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this point, Agesilaus breathed out again and said softly: "But this alliance that the Corinthians talked about... we can't count on it for the time being." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because such an alliance wants to encompass Greece. An alliance that covers most of the local city-states and forms a powerful army cannot be achieved in a short time, and what we lack now is time, right, father?" Based on the experience of leading an army to fight against other Greek city-states in the past few years, Archidamus guessed the reason for this.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The Council of Elders verbally agreed to the suggestion of the Corinthian envoy, but we all know that we cannot count on this non-existent alliance at this stage, but the Theonian army has reached our doorstep, and we are because There is a lack of food and it is impossible to maintain such a large army for a long time..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus lightly beat his stump with his hand and said seriously: "I'm afraid there is one thing you still don't know. The Onian fleet was not only cruising in the Aegean Sea, but some warships loaded with soldiers approached our coast many times, posing as if they were going to land again. This put a lot of pressure on the Council of Elders, and I made a big move After hard work, he persuaded the Council of Elders and the Overseers to agree to risk sending these 7,000 soldiers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Today, there are less than a thousand young warriors left in Sparta. They mainly rely on old people, Pileasians, and some helots to defend the territory. The troops are insufficient and there is great danger. So what we need to do now That's it - defeat this Theonian army as soon as possible, and then return to defend the Spartan territory!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As long as we win this victory, we can win more support from the Persians, revive Sparta's prestige in the Peloponnese, and buy us more time to wait until what the Corinthians say The Greek Alliance is established, and we will fight against Theonia with them, that way we will have a greater chance of winning!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus said, his emotions gradually became more intense.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "However, the commander of the Theonian army seemed to be more cautious.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Archidamus reminded again with some worry: "Those Theonian soldiers have been building camps these days. It seems that they have no intention of fighting us in a short period of time. Maybe they want to wait until we run out of food before attacking." , are we going to attack the Theonian camp?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The Theonians will come out!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " Agesilaus answered confidently.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

   ………………………………………………………………

 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pausanias, the former king of Sparta, the Corinthian War broke out more than 10 years ago , he and Lysander were ordered to lead an army each to attack Thebes together.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Spartan Council of Elders and the censors made a fatal mistake. They selected the commander only based on the ability and position of these two people, but Forgetting that the two men had already regarded each other as enemies due to their opposing political ideas. As a result, Pausanias, who was supposed to join Lysander's army in time during the war, failed to arrive with his army, leaving Lysander alone. Resisting the attack of the Thebans eventually led to a disastrous defeat, and the Spartan hero also died on the battlefield.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The news returned to Sparta, and the people were extremely sad. Incited by Lysander's supporters, they strongly demanded the trial of Pausania. In the end, Pausanias was expelled from Sparta and was never allowed to return.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For a Spartan king who loved his hometown deeply, this punishment was far more cruel than killing him. In the end, Pausanias Ass chose to settle in Tegea because it was very close to Sparta.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tegea was an ally of Sparta. Due to its very important geographical location, Sparta had a stricter attitude towards it than to other allies. Much better, so the two sides have always had close contacts. Pausanias has been in power for decades and has dealt with the Tegeans a lot. And he himself is a rare moderate among the top leaders of Sparta, so most of the allies are hostile to him. More respectable.
