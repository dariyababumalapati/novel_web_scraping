   Chapter 1068: Increase taxes?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So Archibedes calmed down and boldly retorted: "We have harvested some gold and silver mines, but His Majesty once warned our Finance Department that gold and silver cannot be distributed indiscriminately. It must be consistent with the annual grain output and tax revenue." Correspondingly... In short, if there is too much gold and silver, the silver coins in our hands will become worthless, so gold and silver are mined directly from the gold and silver mines. As the cost of this new mercenary army, the Finance Department cannot make the decision. , must obtain His Majesty's approval." After speaking, Archibedes turned around and bowed respectfully to the doctor.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos said softly: "Archibiades is right. Gold and silver mines are strategic materials for the kingdom and cannot be used as long-term financial expenditures unless there are unexpected special circumstances." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty's decision is right! If the gold and silver mines are trampled, dug, and mined indiscriminately, and the kingdom is flooded with gold and silver, it will only destroy the kingdom's trade prosperity and cause chaos." Secretary of Commerce Mariji immediately agreed and endorsed Alkibiades.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Archibedes continued energetically: "And... Sir Alexis, you only saw how much land the kingdom has added, but you didn't see how many officials we added to manage these lands. This is already a huge expenditure. This is not to mention the large relocation costs required to move citizens to these new lands, as well as the construction of roads and roads in these new lands. Bridges, temples...repairing various public facilities and maintenance costs are a huge expense. To tell you the truth, if not for the boom in business in recent years, the increased commercial tax revenue can barely make up for these increases. Expenditure, I'm afraid the monthly salary paid to you will be reduced."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Archibides said, and nodded to Mariji to express his thanks.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alexis was dumbfounded. He originally thought that with this new decree, the kingdom would be able to have two or three more special legions that could be put into battle at any time, and the Ministry of Military Affairs would feel much more relaxed. Unexpectedly, the real difficulty was still there. later.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He said helplessly: "Since everyone has unanimously agreed to establish such an army composed of foreign free people, and believes that sufficient military expenditures must be needed to maintain it, but now the national treasury cannot provide military expenditures for it, but without military expenditures, this army The army cannot be established, so what should we do?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lysias looked at his nose and his heart, looking thoughtful.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sipulos turned his eyes and hesitated several times.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Marij and Sedorum were whispering something.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hermon shrugged and said apologetically: "I don't know much about the kingdom's finances."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Archibedes, who had complained that he had no money before, remained silent at this moment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The other ministers either really didn't know much about this and were a little confused, or they looked like they were thinking about it. There was a strange calmness in the palace hall.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is when a loud voice sounded: "Because building an army that is truly free from daily work and can go into battle at any time is a need for our kingdom's ever-expanding territory. It is a new, long-term and important national policy, so its military expenditures It is best to levy new taxes from the people alone!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as this was said, some people were shocked, some looked the same, and some were obviously relieved.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tax increase, finally someone is talking about it!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ...Davos grasped the armrests of the seat with both hands and looked at the speaker: Atalis, it is indeed him!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dare to serve and be brave enough to serve, he is worthy of being an outstanding talent recommended by Kunogorata back then. Even though he knew that he would offend the general public, he still said it without hesitation and regarded the safety of the kingdom as more important than his own gains and losses.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In comparison, the other rotating chairman he valued, Sipulos, who was more capable of doing things, obviously thought too much. As for Lysias, Hermon, Sedorum and others... haha.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos glanced at the ministers calmly, taking in all living beings. When his eyes came into contact with Sipulos, Sipulos quickly moved his head away. He had realized that his performance just now had disappointed Davos. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Increase taxes? This is not good. I'm afraid it will be difficult for the people to accept it." The first to respond was Medical Minister Helps.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, since the establishment of Theonia, the kingdom's direct tax has been one percent. It has remained unchanged for almost 20 years. The people are used to it. If there is a tax now, let them pay more money. I'm afraid it will be difficult for them to accept it." Minister of Construction Heraclid also expressed his attitude later. As technical officials, he and Helps did not seem to consider the problem from the perspective of the kingdom. The first thing they thought of was the mentality of the people. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty has just said that the times are changing, the environment is changing, the kingdom is changing, of course our laws should also change to adapt to the new needs! When Theonia was established 20 years ago, it only had three The four small towns have a population of less than 30,000, which is very inconspicuous; but now the kingdom is the overlord of the Western Mediterranean, with a territory that is more than ten times that of the past, a population of more than 3 million, and many affiliated countries. Our city-states and forces are no longer the small city-state alliance of the past!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sipulos finally stood up and spoke, and he said emotionally: "When Theonia was first established, all public officials, including senators, did not Salary, and now a month's salary of a junior official in the kingdom can roughly buy a cow, not to mention us;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   20 years ago, Theonia sent troops to fight, and all the citizens who could fight together were less than 10,000, almost You can reach the front line within an hour, and the battle can be over and return to the city-state in a day or two. The time is so short that the soldiers have not even finished the rations they brought from home;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   but now, once the kingdom launches a war, it can easily dispatch tens of thousands People, combat time are calculated in months, and the required military rations are calculated in tons as the basic unit, not including other material consumption, all of which are provided by the kingdom;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   20 years ago, in addition to building roads, Theonia , there is no big expenditure, and now there are countless public buildings in the kingdom. Not only the construction costs, but also the maintenance costs are a large number, and the money earned by schools and public hospitals in various towns is simply not enough. To maintain its operation, subsidies from the kingdom are needed to maintain it...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The bigger the kingdom, the greater the consumption. Can the one percent tax alone meet the growing needs of the Kingdom of Theonia? Of course not! We rely on it. It is a commercial tax collected because of the prosperity of trade brought about by the kingdom's strength! It is a inheritance tax collected because the kingdom's strength makes the citizens rich! It is a business tax collected because the kingdom's strength makes people's lives rich and colorful (for example, the Ministry of Commerce Lottery for competitive games hosted by him, library book borrowing fees, etc.)! It is only through His Majesty's wisdom and everyone's hard work that we can barely guarantee the kingdom's development today!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   To be honest, the direct tax collected by the Kingdom has remained at one percent for 20 years, which is definitely a huge miracle!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is Hades' blessing!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is His Majesty's mercy!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even in the most difficult times of the war, the kingdom only borrowed money from the people instead of charging outrageously high war taxes. The people of Theonia should feel very lucky that they live in such a happy kingdom and not elsewhere. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Look around us. This is no longer the traditional world of a few decades ago where citizens of Greek city-states did not receive direct taxes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the eastern part of Sicily, during the reign of Dionysius, the war tax of each city-state was as high as more than 30%, and it lasted for many years. Even after he was overthrown, Syracuse's annual direct tax was close to 10%. % to ensure that the city-states can recover their strength as soon as possible and ensure security under our pressure; in

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   the west of Sicily, the tax rates of the Phoenician city-states and Carthage states are relatively low, but they are also more than 5%. It is said that these Money from the taxes was spent on the conquest of southern Iberia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Looking at the Greek mainland, wars have been frequent in the past few decades. Which city-state does not have a direct tax of more than 20%? Even the richest city, Athens, even came up with a wonderful tax collection method, dividing the Demo area under its jurisdiction. Each tax collection area must have a lot of wealthy foreign businessmen settled in it, and then it stipulates how much tax the area must pay. If it does not meet the limit, it will be punished. Often due to the pleading and coercion of the people in the area, more than half of the tax amount comes from these people. The wealthy businessman took it upon himself.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not to mention Sparta, which had always been a city-state where all the wealth earned was controlled by the government, which was then responsible for distribution.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone, this is a world where wars are frequent and dangers are reborn. The countries and forces around us are accumulating strength and fighting.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even though Theonia is now strong, it cannot be taken lightly. Not only should the kingdom increase taxes, but the tax rate should not be too low. Only in this way can the normal operation of the kingdom be ensured, and it will have enough power to protect the security of the territory and defend the interests of the people!

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sipulos's words were so shocking that some people were stunned and some people suddenly realized.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Immediately afterwards, Davos praised loudly: "Well said!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Many people realized at this time: Your Majesty supports tax increases!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The atmosphere in the hall began to change, but Lysias still worriedly persuaded: "Your Majesty, once additional taxes are proposed, it will not only cause trouble in the Senate It will be very controversial, and it will cause great dissatisfaction among the people. It may cause turmoil in the kingdom, and it will have a great impact on your majesty's prestige!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   smiled faintly and said in a deep voice: "As a descendant of Hades, the patron saint of this kingdom, I, as a descendant of Hades, the patron saint of this kingdom, do I still care if Atalis and Sipulos have the courage to make such suggestions for the sake of national interests, regardless of personal honor and disgrace?" Is this objectionable?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I only ask you, Lysias, should taxes be increased?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos pointed directly to the center. Lysias could not avoid it and could only reply: "Your Majesty, judging from the current situation of the kingdom, we... need an army formed by foreign free people; in order not to affect the kingdom For the normal operation of the army, we also... need to increase a little extra tax to provide material support for this army.
