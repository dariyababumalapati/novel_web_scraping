   "Dido was also a little dissatisfied with this, but she said that King Davos wrote her a letter specifically, hoping that she would not hinder Hanno and others from escaping to the Eastern Mediterranean, otherwise they would be killed. The news was passed back to Carthage, causing the Carthage nobles to panic, which caused twists and turns in the alliance between Carthage and Theonia... Oh, King Davos also promised that even if Hanno and the others fled to Tyre, they would There is no way to escape the punishment of Theonia, but that is not now..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What do you mean by this?!" Hasdrubal blinked and asked slightly in surprise: "Is King Davos still willing? Declaring war on Persia?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This is not impossible." Kisgo obviously noticed this sentence and analyzed it carefully on the way back, so he said: "Eastern Phoenicia is a vassal state of Persia. Sending a fleet to participate in the war in the Western Mediterranean is actually tantamount to Persia declaring war on Theonia, but the two sides have tacitly agreed not to mention it until now. However, at the end of the Western Mediterranean War, Persia once sent an envoy to Theonia. King Onia asked to stop the war against Carthage, and it is said that he even made threats, but was strongly rejected by King Davos. Davos is a king with a tough character, and he may have been thinking about this..."

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Fight with Persia!..." Hasdrubal leaned back on his chair, his eyes showing infinite longing. He said with some excitement: "Who dares to fight against the powerful Persia? This is a rising star. The kingdom should have the magnanimity it deserves! It seems that I also need to make more military exploits here, and in the future I can lead the army to personally seek revenge on Hannuo!"

   5 days later In the early morning, at the Diolia military camp in the Florentia territory, the sentries on the city were patrolling.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Look! There's an enemy situation!" A sentry pointed forward and shouted.
  </font>

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   soon as he finished speaking, he saw a puff of black smoke rising from the mountains to the northeast, and then to the northwest...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In just a short moment, Wherever the sentries could see, there were at least six or seven black smoke rising straight into the sky. They were all caused by the sentry towers built in the mountains around the military camp. It is rare to see two black smoke at the same time. , but a situation like today is unprecedented.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Go and inform the legion commander that the Gauls have invaded in large numbers!" the patrol officer said nervously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not long after, the alarm bell in the military camp rang.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldiers quickly put on their armor, picked up their weapons, and ran out of the dormitory.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   People in the civilian areas also received an urgent notice. They quickly carried important belongings and fled to the city of Florentia not far away.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hasdrubal, surrounded by his subordinates, climbed to the top of the northern city, just in time to see thousands of Gauls pouring out of the mountains and rushing towards the military camp in black pressure.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was the first time for Hasturuba to see such a large number of Gauls. However, he was experienced in war and did not panic. Instead, he said calmly: "Inform the entire battalion immediately to prepare for defense! At the same time, send messengers , inform the troops of the other two camps to hold on to the camps and not to rescue each other!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Immediately send a messenger to Rome to report to Asistes, the administrator of the Roman region, and tell him that the Gauls are invading the Etruscans. Leah, ask him to rescue!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After arranging all this, Hasdrubal looked at the nervous soldiers around him and shouted loudly: "The soldiers of the Border Legion all say that the Gauls are terrible. , but we have defeated them many times! Although they have many soldiers now, these natives are not good at attacking cities, and we have strong city defenses and sufficient military rations. As long as we hold on for ten days to half a month, the kingdom's reinforcements will Come, and then cooperate with them to eliminate the invading Gauls together. You have made great contributions, and the kingdom may reward you and shorten the number of years you have to become a formal citizen!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ho! Ho! Ho!..." The soldiers roared with excitement.

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the evening, a banquet will be held at the residence of Crotocatacus, the Roman administrative adjutant, to celebrate the prince's promotion to the administrator of Viai.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   All the invited guests were present, except for the most important guest, Asistes, the Roman prefect, who had not yet arrived, so the banquet had not yet begun.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the guests all knew that Asistes was busy with affairs and usually never attended anyone's banquet. The reason why he agreed to come this time was because of Clotokatax's special status.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is everyone's honor to be here, so the guests wait patiently with expectations.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the head of the banquet, Clotocactus was having a pleasant conversation with his brother-in-law Patroclus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since Patroclus took office as the commander of the Fourteenth Army last year, the two families were relatives, but now they live close to each other, so they have more contacts and their relationship has become closer.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, a man rushed into the hall and said loudly: "My lords, I have just received news that the Gauls invaded the Etruscan territory. Lord Asistes ordered you to rush to the area immediately. Administrative Hall, discuss countermeasures!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone recognized that this was Asistes' secretary, and the order he conveyed was naturally true. There was an uproar at the banquet, but no one left first, and they all turned their attention to the banquet. Owner.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax stood up without hesitation and said: "The invasion of Gauls is a big deal, we have to rush to the administrative hall!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then he said to the slaves: "Pack up all the dishes and send them to Administrative Hall! Everyone may be busy until late tonight. How can we survive without dinner?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The servants hurried to get busy. The guests praised Crotokartax for his thoughtfulness and followed him out. Mansion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the back room, Dido was also entertaining the guests' families, saying that she was celebrating her husband's promotion, but for her, she was also celebrating the major event of "Hanno was expelled and Carthage joined the Theonian League."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the news from the hall reached the back room, the women all looked panicked. Only Dido looked calm. She loudly comforted everyone: "Ladies, there is nothing to worry about! The Gauls' army is far away in northern Etruria. Controlled by our border legions; our allies in and around Rome will soon organize a huge reinforcement army to cross the Tiber River to repel the Gauls who invaded Etruria; To the south of us, after the kingdom gets the news, more reinforcements will be sent soon. It is impossible for the Gauls to step into the Roman area, so don't worry!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Under Dido's comfort, these officials Not only did the madam gradually lose her panic, but she also ate happily.
  </font>

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Roman Regional Administration is also located in the city of Rome, only two blocks away from the city hall. When Clotocatacus, Patroclus, etc. When people walked into the conference room, Asistes was giving orders to his officials.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You immediately set off for Selcher, notify the Volscians, and ask them to send reinforcements in accordance with the covenant, and join our army to resist the invading Gauls!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You immediately rush to Frontilum and tell Hel The Nikes and Gauls are here, let them gather their troops and join them in Rome!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Go and notify the Sabines immediately and ask them to send reinforcements as soon as possible..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ……………………………… ...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After receiving the order, officials hurried out of the conference room. They didn't even have time to return home, so they acted as messengers, mounted their horses, took their entourage, and rushed to their destination in the dark night.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Asistes saw Crotocatacus coming in, he said to him seriously: "I'm sorry that your banquet cannot be held. Moreover, the enemy is currently facing a strong enemy, and the city of Rome is short of manpower. As the administrative adjutant of Rome, this For more than a year, you have basically taken over the main political affairs of the city of Rome, so I have to ask you to suspend your appointment as Viai, help me temporarily manage Rome, and at the same time take on the important task of providing logistical support for the army!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Asiste After Si took office as the administrator of the Roman region, Davos did not relinquish his original position as the administrator of Rome, but also allowed him to continue to serve concurrently.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, Asistes did not forget about the power he held. Instead, he made a decision on the grounds that "he had to manage the administrative affairs of the entire region and was too busy": Clotocathus would gradually take over the administrative affairs of Rome. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It's just that he never expected that Davos would transfer Crotoka Tax to Weiai a year later.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I am willing to follow your arrangements, Master Asistes, and contribute my greatest strength to resist the Gauls and defend the Roman region!" Crotocathax said firmly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Asistes had already expected that Crotocatacus would answer like this. He immediately arranged for the young man to lead a group of officials to count the material reserves in Rome in recent years and estimate how much food and materials could be allocated to supply. army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After receiving the mission, Asistes turned around and asked Patroclus: "I have sent people to inform the Latin allies, the Volsci, the Hernikeys, the Massi, the Aequians, the Sabines... Wait for the forces allied with us to send reinforcements to join us in resisting the Gauls. Based on past experience, how long do you think it will take before they can lead their troops to gather in Rome?" Due to the Gauls' invasion of

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Iraq in the past two years, The northern territory of Trulia is becoming more and more frequent. In order to be prepared, Patroclus organized two military trainings with the allied armies after arriving in Rome. Generally speaking, the allies were quite cooperative.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Patroclus thought for a while and said: "The Latins, Volscians, and Hernicians are closer to us, and the army will come faster, and they can arrive within four or five days; the Sabines, and the Aequians , Massi people... are far away, at least eight or nine days. However, now that the Gauls are about to invade in a large scale, I think they will also speed up the gathering of troops. What is the situation in the north now?"
