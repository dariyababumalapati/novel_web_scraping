   Chapter 1297: Postwar Governance
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The pen that was writing quickly paused, and Henipolis took a breath: It is already a great honor to erect a statue in front of the administrative building. Since the establishment of Theonia, only Mel Sith alone has this honor, and it was erected after his death; the reason why Theonia was able to rise rapidly within decades mainly relied on its powerful military, and the shining generals supported this The pillar of powerful power, but naming a legion or fleet after a person has never been done before. If the first fleet can finally be named successfully, Sekerian will undoubtedly be the first person in the Theonian army, even if he dies immediately , maybe he can accept it happily...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While Henepolis was distracted, Davos continued: "Appoint Midorades as the temporary first fleet commander, and Stephaskas as the wartime commander. Commander of the Second Fleet and Commander of the First Squadron of the First Fleet, Ramakas, has outstanding military exploits. This time he assisted Sekerian in tenaciously defending against the attack of the Persian fleet. He was specially appointed as the commander of the Third Fleet during the war. Midora Des takes full command of the three fleets, continues to attack the Persian fleet, completely controls the sea control of the Eastern Mediterranean, ensures the transportation safety of each fleet, and provides assistance for the army to attack Persia!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Henipolis kept writing by hand, but he was thinking in his heart: It is said that he took over temporarily, just to make Sekerian and the crew of the First Fleet feel better. I am afraid that His Majesty does not think that Sekerian can recover at all. Fortunately, Ramakas of the First Fleet has been promoted. It can make the crew of the First Fleet feel better.

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Write to Alexis and ask him to inform the troops to prepare for the attack! Write to the administrator of Naukratis and ask him to arrange the transport fleet and be ready to set off eastward at any time!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos stared at Looking at the ostriches running through the trees in front of him, after a moment, he turned back to look down at Henipolis and said loudly: "Heni, are you ready? We are going to Persia!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Henipolis said excitedly immediately : "Your Majesty, I have been looking forward to this day for a long time. The most glorious chapter in the biography I wrote is right there!"

   His left hand pointed hard to the east.

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In March, after the news that the Greek coalition forces defeated the Persian Army of Asia Minor in Mysia spread, it caused a huge shock to the people in western Asia Minor. Many towns that had been in a wait-and-see state broke out in riots one after another, driving away the local Persian garrison and publicly announcing their support for Theonia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While Leoticides accepted their surrender, he also asked them to provide food and fodder supplies.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, after letting his troops rest for a while, he quickly advanced towards Frisia, the base camp of the Persian army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Persian Army of Asia Minor was originally a makeshift army. After suffering a disastrous defeat, some demoralized regional armies refused to continue fighting, and some even led their remnants back to their respective areas without asking Panabazus for instructions.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Faced with the rapid approach of the Greek coalition forces, Pharnabazus, whose troops had been drastically reduced, did not try every means to defend himself. Instead, after some conspiracy among his colleagues, he arrested Jason as a traitor.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Jason, who finally escaped back to Phrygia, was executed before he could defend himself. In the battle report written to the King of Persia, Pharnabazus argued that in the battle with the Greek coalition, he was hired by the Greeks who only had important responsibilities. The sudden rebellion of the army was the main reason for the failure of the battle.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Persian commander-in-chief and generals used Jason as a scapegoat, hoping to escape the blame for their defeat, but this frightened the Greek mercenaries who returned from defeat. Several mercenary officers pretended to be "revenge for General Jason" Although the rebellion launched under the banner of the Greek mercenaries was more solidified, it also caused the situation in Phrygia to completely lose control, causing Pharnabazus to lead the remaining army to continue to retreat hastily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Greek coalition successfully occupied Geldium, the center of Phrygia. Leoticides did not continue to pursue eastward and deep into the interior. Instead, after raising a lot of supplies locally, he left a force to garrison and the main force turned around. Moving south, the troops pointed directly at Lydia, without encountering any effective resistance along the way. By the end of May, the Greek coalition forces quickly entered the area around the important Lydian town of Sardes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leotychid's fast march thwarted the Persian garrison's attempt to transfer the wealth from the area, and the powerful military of the Greek coalition also frightened the defenders of Sardes, who voluntarily surrendered the city.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After occupying Sardes, the Greek coalition did not continue the attack, but repaired in the area while Leoticides awaited the arrival of the men he had requested from King Davos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In early June, Leoticides led the coalition generals and some officials from the original Lydia to go out of the city to greet the Diorian envoy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Theonian messenger is not one person, but a group of people.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The leader was an old man. Although he had gray hair and an old face, his expression was resolute and his movements were quite dignified.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lord Proseus, I'm really sorry, I'm a little late!" Knowing Leoticides' withdrawn character, the old man took the initiative to say after seeing him: "More than two months ago, I took over Following His Majesty's orders, we came to Asia Minor to take over the areas you conquered. However, it took some time because we had to wait for a group of officials selected by the Palace Administration Department to be sent here. Originally, we were planning to land in Ilion, but we heard that You have already captured Geldium and are marching south, so we changed our route and landed in Eritrea (a Greek city-state on the east side of Chios Island, which fell to Theonia after the Greek coalition defeated the Persian army). I hurried along slowly and hurriedly. Although I encountered a little trouble, I finally saw you in a relatively timely manner..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing this, Leoticides just said dryly: "Thank you, Asia Minor is indeed vast. Marching and fighting here is far more time-consuming than in Italy or Greece -"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Staff Officer Muklu quickly said: "Master Capos, we have been looking forward to your arrival for a long time! With you sitting in the rear, the Greek coalition forces will be completely gone. With no worries, you can boldly continue to march eastward!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Capps was originally a person who didn't like to talk too much, but after serving as the regional chief executive for many years, he has made a lot of changes. In addition, he is getting older and has a more mature mentality. Ping He, who was comfortable with such an occasion, said humbly: "I am new here, and I am completely unfamiliar with everything here. It will take a while to get familiar with it, and I also need your help and support. But I can promise you that I and I These officials behind you have traveled thousands of miles to come here, not to enjoy themselves, but to follow His Majesty's instructions and do their best to ensure the stability of the conquered areas and ensure your logistics supply so that you can attack Persia with all your strength! Because defeating Persia is our common wish, don't you think?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This last question was what Capps turned around and said to the administrative officials who followed him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lord Capos is right, defeating Persia is the common wish of our Theonia and our allies!" The officials responded in unison.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides showed a rare smile and said: "Lord Capus, please let me introduce to you - this is Ipamilonda, the military commander of the Boeotian Alliance." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But what is the command? The coalition forces of Bis defeated Sparta's General Ipamilonda in the Battle of Leuctra?! Oh my, it's an honor to meet you!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I heard that Lord Capus was the hero of the expedition to Persia. The reason why we are here today I dared to attack Persia because I was inspired by your heroic deeds!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Ashamed! Ashamed! I was just a soldier following Your Majesty back then. Without Your Majesty's superb command, I would have been buried in this foreign land.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "...This is
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   the 
      Athenian general Iphicrates.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " "He was the famous Athenian general Iphicrates who pioneered light infantry tactics in Greece and defeated the Spartan army many times in the Corinthian War. General Si?! It's an honor to meet you!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Master Capus, you are so complimentary! I heard that you had already begun to use light infantry tactics to fight the Persians when you were fighting in Persia. I learned it from the tactics of the Onian army." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Back then, it was His Majesty who forced us to start practicing light infantry tactics. We were not willing to do so at first, but after we became proficient in using them, we found that the results were very good! You can abandon the inherent Greek military tradition. , take the initiative to learn, and be able to create light infantry tactics unique to Athens based on the actual situation in Greece, amazing!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ...This is -"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This person needs no introduction, I know Arcadia Lycomedes, the chief general of the alliance! When I returned to the Senate to report my work four years ago, he happened to be visiting Thurii, and we also attended His Majesty's banquet together." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lord Capus, I happened to be watching you at that time. I was very surprised when I reported to the Senate! There are a large number of fierce and barbaric Gauls living in northern Italy. Lord Cappus served as the administrator there for many years. He not only kept those areas stable, but also made those backward people The Gauls took the initiative to learn Greek civilization and actively integrated into Theonia, which shows the ability of Mr. Capus!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sir Lycomedes praised me so much. I can make people like me in Theonia There are many regional administrators who have been integrated into Theonia by local indigenous people, such as Lord Hieros in Thessaly and Lord Asistes in Egypt, who have outstanding talents in this area. I hope Hades will bless you, The people here can cooperate well with us to overthrow the tyranny of Persia and create a better future together!" ...
