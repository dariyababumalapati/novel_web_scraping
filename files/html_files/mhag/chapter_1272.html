   Chapter 1272 Racing Competition (End)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, the staff on the central spine platform also started to get busy. They used buckets to scoop water from the pools in the platform, and then poured water on the horses passing by them... …
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Why do you need to break the horse's water?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "That's because the horse's body temperature will gradually rise during vigorous running. If the body temperature remains high for a long time and cannot be lowered, the horse will get sick or even die… So splashing water on the horse to help cool it down can protect the horse from getting sick after the race."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Oh, so that's it! Why is the animal in the middle that indicates the number of laps a dolphin and not some other animal? I like elephants and hippopotamuses. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   No, I prefer Aunt Eunice's black cat."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "That's because this arena holds racing or horse racing competitions. The main competition object is horses, and the god Poseidon is the patron saint of horses. So Who can tell me what the animal messenger of Poseidon is?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I know, I know, it's a dolphin!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, it's a dolphin. Silver statues of dolphins are used to mark the laps of racing and horse racing. , I hope to be blessed by Poseidon and protect the participating horses. This is a beautiful wish."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Oh, so that's it! Uncle Apox, is the Poseidon statue placed in the middle of the field also a wish? Can it protect horse racing?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, that's right."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Is that why you put the statue of grandpa there?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Apox, who patiently answered the children's questions like an encyclopedia, was stumped. , but he wittily asked the question to his father: "Chris, you should ask your grandpa this question?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos watched the game while listening to his children and grandchildren chattering in his ears. At this moment, he didn't have the majesty of a king at all. Instead, he looked like an old man enjoying family happiness. He said with a smile: "I don't know why, Chris. You have to ask your father. He was responsible for building this venue."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax saw his father's intention and said jokingly: "I don't know why, because the entire pattern of the ridge on the field was designed by your uncle Alex, so of course I approved it." It's been built."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the children looked at Alex sitting next to Eunice with questioning eyes, the master sculptor, who was usually taciturn but spoke quickly when he spoke, said perfunctorily: "Child Guys, don't you think this design looks good?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the children nodded in agreement, Anteblis burst into laughter and couldn't help but said: "Brother-in-law, you usually look so honest, but now you have learned to lie. Well, you might as well just say that you are flattering dad with this design."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Indeed, the composition and construction of the entire arena's central spine look very imposing, but the statue of Davos riding a horse and wielding a sword is obviously more beautiful than riding the waves. The statue of Poseidon is larger and positioned higher, giving the audience the feeling that the descendants of Hades are more powerful than Poseidon, one of the three main gods.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What nonsense are you talking about!" Eunice's eyes widened, and she reached out and hit her brother lightly on the back of the head.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Mom, did you see it? Eunice actually hit me!" Anteblis immediately complained to Christoya.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You are two years old, but you are still like a child, and you are not afraid of your children laughing at you!" Kristoya scolded with a smile.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Father, mother, and everyone... It's almost noon. You must be hungry. Let's drink some syrup and eat something first." Axikus walked into the royal stand with a smile, followed by four slaves. Each of them held a silver plate filled with rich food.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I say Axikus, Ribazzo is responsible for preparing lunch, so stop busying yourself, sit down quickly, and watch the game together as a family." Christoya persuaded kindly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Axikus said with a smile: "I can't sit still, help Ribazo -"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Sit down!" Agnes glanced at him impatiently.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Hey!" Axikus nodded quickly and sat down. He was always a little nervous when facing his mother-in-law, who never talked much.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When he sat down, he immediately picked up a jar of syrup and handed it over: "Avia, this is for you."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Aviya took it with a smile.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Everyone, please pay attention, there is still the last half circle!" Antbris's shout once again focused the attention of everyone in the royal family on the arena.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ………………………………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Turning the last corner, the Egyptian racing car was still at the front, followed closely by Procris, the two racing cars Put some distance between you and the other cars.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is a 500-meter straight ahead, and the staff has already pulled up a red banner at the end. The winner of this round will definitely be between the two of them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Procris was anxious. He looked at the Egyptian car on the inside and saw that his own car was still one horse's head behind him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Egyptian is so stable. From the first lap until now, he has been in first place and has never been surpassed. However, Procris is not willing to admit defeat: there is still the last half lap. If you don't fight now, it will be worse. when!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He raised his whip and hit the mare in the middle with a moderate force, while shouting: "Efila! Efila! Run! Run as hard as you can! Run!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It seemed that After understanding what Procris said, the beautiful mare shook her slender neck and neighed crisply and sweetly. Her tired hooves moved faster, and the speed that had declined suddenly increased again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The stallions also speeded up and neighed at the same time, all wanting to show their strength in front of their beloved girls.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Under their hard pull, Procris's car not only caught up with the Egyptian car, but also slightly surpassed it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing this, the Egyptian driver also tried his best to accelerate the car.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two cars raced side by side on the wide track at high speed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The enthusiasm of the audience has also reached its peak. Almost all of them stood up, danced and cheered loudly. This warm atmosphere not only injected great power into the drivers, but also into the horses.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The horses leaped into the air with all four hooves, and their originally soft manes and tails actually floated straight in the air. The sweat on their bodies swayed around as their muscles contracted and relaxed...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's so beautiful! It's so beautiful!" Arik Si was once again intoxicated in front of the railing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For a racing car running at full speed, the distance of 500 meters is just a short moment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   too fast!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the two racing cars crossed the finish line, many spectators could not even tell who had won, until the track staff handed the flag of the Holy Kingdom of Theonia to Procris, who wore it and drove the carriage , walked slowly around the venue, the audience desperately applauded: Can you not be extremely excited?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because the winner is a Turui player, a true one of our own!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Procris kept waving to the surrounding audience and smiled very happily. Although the racing competition was not over, he would participate in the next competition in the next few days and may not even win the final championship, but at this moment he was completely enjoying it. With his own glory.

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   July 15th, the last day of the Theonian Games, according to preparations According to the latest medal list announced by the team, the first place is Athens, the second place is tied with the Arcadian League led by Mandinia and Elis, and the third place is Thurii, the Kingdom of Theonia The region was tied with the Boeotian League led by Thebes.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   According to the rules set by the Theonian Games, winning the championship in the finals of each event will be worth three points, winning second place will be worth two points, and third place will be worth one point. The points for the top three in the medal list are also different. One or two points shows the fierce competition.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Athens ranking first was expected by many old spectators of the games. After all, it has a long culture of sports competition, a large enough population and abundant financial resources to cultivate outstanding competitive talents. There is no shortage of Athenians winning championships. It is a veritable powerhouse in sports competition. It is not surprising that this time it performed well in the traditional events of the Theonian Games.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the other hand, the performance of Sparta, another strong sports power in Greece, has been disappointing. They have only scored a pitiful two points so far, and the competition event they were best at - reloading racing, did not even rank. get.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, this is understandable, because since Theonia conquered Sparta and reestablished the new government, during these five years, the new Spartan government has long been proud of the original Spartans and implemented it for hundreds of years. The political system reformed by Lycurgus was thrown into the garbage heap. Naturally, the military tradition of survival of the fittest that Spartan citizens had long adhered to from infancy to concentrated training in youth was naturally cancelled. The former Spartan warriors were either Farming in the fields, or learning to sail and do business in the port, their physical fitness and skills have been wasted, and they are completely unable to compete with strong opponents.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The ones who replaced Sparta and monopolized the heavy equipment racing event were naturally the players from the Kingdom of Theonia. Not only in the heavy equipment racing event, these Theonia players also included the top five in the newly created military events. 8 people, and also showed strong advantages in archery, javelin, horseback riding, racing, and rowing racing, which attracted the attention of the invited envoys from friendly city-states and forces, because these events are closely related to military affairs. , from this aspect, the power of Theonia's military power can be demonstrated.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Theonian Games has only one final event left - marathon running.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There was a lot of controversy when the Games preparatory team set the marathon route.
  </font>
 </font>

   Thanks glll for the tip!
