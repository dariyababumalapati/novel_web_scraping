   Chapter 1266 Passing the Throne
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a long time, Davos's expression became determined: "When I defeat Persia and return in triumph, I will abdicate and let you take over and become the second king of the Holy Kingdom of Theonia!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " Hearing this, Lotokatax was shocked: "Father, you are in good spirits and good health. You have never had a serious illness. The doctor said that you can live to be a hundred years old. Why do you suddenly say that you want to abdicate?! Please stop this! Ridiculous idea, kid, I will never agree!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He seemed very excited, even a little panicked, and almost knelt down in front of Davos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos looked at him with kind eyes and said comfortingly: "My child, I know you are very filial, but this idea of ​​mine is not just a whim. I have been thinking about it for a long time..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos stretched out his hand again and gently Holding his son's broad shoulders, he said with emotion: "I grew from a poor mercenary to the king of a powerful kingdom in the Mediterranean. In addition to the blessing of Hades, all I relied on was hard work - unremitting hard work! Never fear From fighting to personally leading soldiers to charge, from not understanding war to understanding war, from being unfamiliar with political affairs to being familiar with all aspects of the kingdom's problems... In these 30 years, I have not dared to relax for a moment, and have always been alert to myself. Work hard! Work hard! Otherwise, everything you have achieved before will be in vain!... Now that the political situation of the kingdom is stable and the great cause of unifying the Mediterranean is about to be completed, I have nothing to worry about!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos thumped with his other hand. Legs, he said softly: "You think I am in good health, but that is all an illusion. In the past few years, I have often been unable to eat due to stomach pain, and the joints of my shoulders and knees often hurt... These are all problems left over from the previous battles. I am old I'm... Not only am I low on energy, but my memory is also declining. I often fall asleep while reviewing documents, and sometimes I forget some important things..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax felt a tremor as he listened. Feeling sad, he said eagerly with red eyes: "Father, you don't have to work as hard as before. The child has grown up and can share a lot of things for you. You just need to continue to grasp the direction of the kingdom! No need. ..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos interrupted him with a smile: "Clato, I have worked hard for most of my life, and I really want to live a plain and leisurely life, talking and laughing with my old friends without any worries. Go around without any worries and see Athens, Sparta, Carthage, Byzantium... Of course you have to take your two mothers with you... How could I not know that for so many years, every time I go on an expedition, Your mothers are worried about me day and night! How could I not know that I was handling political affairs in the palace until late at night, and your mothers stayed up late waiting..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos said emotionally: "I owe them a lot, and I want to use it. There is not much time left in the rest of this life to compensate them. Clotto, will you give me this opportunity?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Father..." Clottokas hesitated.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos smiled freely and said seriously: "The reason why I want to abdicate is because I want to set an example for our Hades Davos family. As people get older, their thoughts tend to become rigid, conservative, and stubborn. , for ordinary people, this is nothing, but for a kingdom, this is not conducive to the development of the kingdom!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Let the heir ascend the throne earlier and accumulate more experience. If problems arise, the father and son can still discuss it, which is beneficial to the entire kingdom... ...There has never been a kingdom that lasted forever. Let the successors be trained more and there will be fewer mediocre ones. Our Hades Davos family may be able to persist longer..." "Maybe
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   this is just one of my problems. Such a childish idea." Davos smiled again and said seriously: "Let us focus on the present, even if Persia is defeated by us in the future, the kingdom controls the entire Mediterranean, and the problems faced by Theonia There are still many, just like what you have been worried about how to change Theonia's national policy of establishing a country by force and allow the kingdom to develop more steadily, and how to make the regional forces that encompass the entire Mediterranean become more and more integrated into the kingdom without splitting... …
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Also, even without Persia and Carthage as rivals, the kingdom will never have fewer enemies in the future, such as the Gauls living in the vast territory north of the Alps, and the dense forests north of the Gauls. The more savage and fierce Germanic people... These problems all need to be faced by you, and some of them will even continue to the next generation of Chris and others, and even beyond, so don't be impatient and take your time..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Father... "Klotokas was so excited that he wanted to say something else.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos waved his hand again to interrupt him: "Okay, we have been out for a long time. It's time to go back to the banquet. Don't let everyone worry! Remember, this matter must be kept strictly confidential!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatak All kinds of emotions were surging in Si's heart, and in the end he could only squeeze out a cry of grievance: "Yes..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos stood up, pushed open the door of the study, looked out at the dark night, and it seemed as if a heavy burden had been lifted off his body. He said in a relaxed tone: "In the next few days, we will enjoy the sports games and wait for news from Africa."
  </font>

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The wonderful performance of the Theonian Games on the first day ignited the passion of the players and spectators, and the following games were in full swing. For all the people in Thurii, it seemed like they were participating in a celebration every day. They cheered crazily at the edge of the arena, drank and celebrated in the restaurant after the game...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But in this festive atmosphere, ordinary people had no idea that the Egyptian envoy delegation encountered a sea storm, and no one knew that on the first day of the opening ceremony Early the next morning, King Davos called Aristiras, the head of the intelligence department, to the study room of the mansion for a confidential discussion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the fifth day of the competition, the individual archery finals were held at the archery venue in the west of Thurii City. The finalists were Megakides from Crete and Stasypus from the Thurii region of Theonia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Both sides have completed the prescribed three rounds, with a total of nine arrows, and are waiting for the referee to calculate the results.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, after every round of shooting, the target shooter will bring over the round wooden board with the arrow inserted and show it to the players and the audience to show the fairness of the competition, so both the players and the audience generally know Match Results.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But when the referee loudly announced: "Crete's Megakides, 86 rings; Thurii's Stasypus, 86!" There was a cry of regret in the audience, but then they cheered enthusiastically. Palm comes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the archery competition first started, there were not many spectators who came to watch the competition. More than half of the spectators came out of curiosity to watch this event that had never appeared in other sports games. Many of them even came because they could not buy it. I had no choice but to buy tickets for the archery venue to feel the real atmosphere of the sports meeting.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the preparatory team's ingenious setting of the archery schedule and the unique quiet but exciting competition style of archery compared to other fierce competitions gradually attracted a large number of fans, and by the time of the finals it was already hard to get a ticket .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The two sides are tied, so there will be an extra round!" As soon as the referee finished speaking, the audience began to cheer. Of course they are happy to have more games, and most of the audience are cheering for Stasypur. After all, Stasypur Si was a native of Thurii, and among the few who cheered for Megakides, Silitaos cheered the loudest.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Siriteos was eliminated in the 100-meter semi-finals the day before yesterday. He didn't have much confidence in winning the championship. On the contrary, due to his eye-catching performance in the past few days, some people actually talked to him privately. Contact him and express his desire to marry his daughter to him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But there are no citizens of Theonia among these people, and the reason is simple: most young women in Theonia have received orthodox education in Theonia schools since childhood, and most of them are knowledgeable, intelligent, and open-minded women. Handsome faces and strong bodies cannot completely attract them, not to mention that the trend in Theonian society at this time is to revere heroes on the battlefield, down-to-earth and capable officials, and knowledgeable scholars, and Silitaos is not even a A citizen of Theonia is just a Greek from a barren island. The young women of Theonia are so proud that their kingdom has become the overlord of the Greek world, so they will not consider this at all.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Siriteos was jumping and shouting in the audience, but it did not have any impact on Megakides. His attention was focused on his opponent: this is an elderly citizen of Theonia. , but there is no sign of physical gain. Instead, he has a tall and well-proportioned body, short beardless hair, sharp eyes, and looks calm and capable.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Realizing that Megakides was sizing him up, the Thurii player named Stasypus also turned to smile at him, raising his hands and feet with an air of grace that made Megakides feel a little bit sad.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The overtime begins, please prepare for both players!" The referee's shout made Megakides recover his mind. He took a game arrow from the staff beside him, put it on the bowstring, and then took a deep breath. He breathed out slowly, and the distracting thoughts in his heart were also expelled from the body with the breath. He slowly raised the bow and pulled the string. When his right arm was slightly higher than his shoulder and his left hand pulled the bow string to his ear, he All movement ceased, like a statue completely still.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The already experienced spectators held their breath at this moment, and the entire archery venue became unusually quiet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a while, I heard "Whoosh!... Whoosh!..." Two bow string sounds were heard one after another, and two arrows shot out quickly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Megakides did not pay close attention to the situation of the hit, but calmly took another arrow and strung the bow again.
  </font>
