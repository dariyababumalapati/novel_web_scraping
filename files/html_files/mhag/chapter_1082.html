   Chapter 1082:
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the war between Croto and Dido in the Western Mediterranean, Davos promulgated two reform measures for the army: First, team officers must undergo study and assessment if they want to be promoted to general officers; second, as long as officers meet the conditions, they can successfully Being promoted to a general officer may not necessarily lead to a definite military position immediately.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because there are only so many general positions in the kingdom, there may not necessarily be vacancies, so you have to wait. It often takes several months or even a year to teach in the military camp before you can take up the post.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Obviously, Patroclus and Sextus did not expect that they would be so lucky. Although they tried to suppress it, their joy was still beyond words.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos stepped forward, took a brand new legion commander's helmet with a purple and red crown from Martius, put it on Patroclus, and then said in a deep voice: "Congratulations, Pat. Commander of the Rocros Legion! This time you go to Rome and take over the Fourteenth Legion. Now the Gauls frequently invade the northern border of Etrunia and may move south in large numbers at any time, regardless of whether the kingdom wants to send reinforcements to assist the Etrunian defense. The border and the Latium area are very likely to become the frontline of the war! Therefore, when you get there, you must not only intensify training of soldiers with the military training officers, but also be alert at all times and think hard about the enemy's strategy. Once a war occurs, I hope that the first The Fourteenth Legion can become the main force to defeat the Gauls!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, please rest assured! I will definitely lead the Fourteenth Legion to ensure the security of the kingdom's territory and protect the people of the kingdom from harm!" Patroclus said powerfully Military salute, answer solemnly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos nodded, then turned to Sextus, took another legion commander's helmet, put it on him, and then said: "Congratulations, Sextus legion commander! But as the eighteenth legion, New chief, your task is not easy! The southern territory of Iberia is the most unstable area in the kingdom. There are many natives around the border who have no good intentions towards the kingdom, and there are still many people in the territory who do not fully understand the kingdom. Return home. When you get there, while cooperating with local officials, you must also actively go deep into each place to investigate and understand the people's conditions so that you can make your own independent judgment. While
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   strengthening the training of legionnaires, you must also make full use of military training time , use various methods to enhance the identification of the citizen soldiers with the kingdom. I hope that the 18th Legion will become the mainstay in southern Iberia under your leadership! Of course, the kingdom is always paying attention to the situation there and will not let you Fight alone!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   These words of Davos made Sextus feel a lot of pressure. When he still punched his right fist forcefully on his left chest, he said decisively: "Your Majesty, please rest assured, I will definitely complete it. Mission, guard the southern region of Iberia!"

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crotocatacus walked out of the Roman City Hall, and the breeze blowing in front of him made him a little tired. His spirits were lifted, he nodded to the palace guards guarding him on both sides, and then walked down the steps.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Every time he sets foot on the Roman Forum, Crotocatacus feels a sense of joy in his heart, because this old square, which has not been renovated for decades, underwent major renovations when he was the architect of Rome, and it was completely brand new. , seeing the people happily walking and playing in the square, he couldn't help but smile. Often at this time, he would subconsciously look north. The temples on the Capitoline Mountains exuded radiance under the setting sun. The magnificent brilliance also contains a lot of his hard work.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because of these, he was loved by the Roman people. All passers-by greeted him enthusiastically, and he took the trouble to respond enthusiastically.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, under normal circumstances, the people would never get close to him. This is because there was an attempted assassination of Crotocatacus two years ago. After the incident became a big deal, the majority of the Roman people knew about this good man. The gentle and kind young official is actually the eldest son of King Davos, which makes it understandable why he is always accompanied by a group of guards.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the assassination, Crotokatax asked the inspectorate and the court not to expand the case too much when tracing the criminals involved in the matter, and not to harass the family members of the criminals... This approach increased the number of The people's love for him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The palace of Crotocatacus was not far from the town hall, on the top of the Palatine Hill, separated from other residences, and guarded by the palace guard.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Crotokatax entered the house, his wife Dido immediately left the main building and came forward to greet him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Looking at his smiling wife, Crotokatax's mind was filled with thoughts: a few years ago, when he learned that his father was engaged to him, and that the woman was a Carthaginian and several years older than him. , his heart is quite resistant.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, he had always obeyed his father's decision since he was a child, so he did not express any clear objection. However, for a period of time at the beginning of his marriage, his attitude towards his wife was cold.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, with constant contact, his attitude changed. He deeply felt that his wife was not only beautiful, but also well-educated, and she also cared about him. At the same time, she was also a very intelligent and capable woman. Although Theonian women are much more open-minded than traditional Greek women, outstanding women like Dido are still very rare in the kingdom. It is these unique characters of hers that strongly attract Crotoka. As a result, Dido's weight in his heart gradually surpassed that of his sister Cynthia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You're back! You must be hungry, dinner is ready!" Dido looked at her tired husband, stepped forward to hold his arm, and said with concern.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Well...what's good to eat today?" Clotokatax held his wife's hand and asked casually.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "There's the fried beef you like, and the cod your mother sent for you," Dido answered.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Salted cod?" Cod has delicious meat, but it is not produced in much in the Mediterranean and is not easy to catch. Once it leaves the sea, it is easy to spoil in a short period of time and is not easy to preserve, which makes cod a higher-priced fish. A kind of delicacy, from Turii to Rome, it would take three or four days at the fastest if there is a tailwind on a fast boat. If it were not salted, it would have become stinky, so Crotocatax asked this question. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's not salted." Seeing her husband's surprised look, Dido explained: "Your mother put the cod in a clay pot, filled it with ice cubes, sealed it, and wrapped it in several layers of cloth. It has been kept in a cool place on the bottom of the boat, so when it was delivered, the ice had not completely melted and the cod was relatively fresh. I asked the chef to make fried cod..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is too extravagant, just to send a few fish, all this trouble !" Clotokatax frowned.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This fish is not for you to eat." Dido rolled her eyes at him and touched her belly and said, "After Chris was sent to Thurii, your mother got it from Peroya (Dido's confidant maid). He knew that I was pregnant again, so he sent many things to express condolences, not just this cod!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax quickly changed his mind: "That's what you should give! That's what you should give! You see, my mother still treats you very much. I care!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dido was silent for a moment, then said softly: "It would be better if we didn't pick up Chris..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "My parents miss their grandson very much! Besides, Chris is pestering you every day and you can't have a good rest. This is not good for the child in your belly. You forgot what the doctor reminded us last time! ... ..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You're right, I shouldn't mention this again. Let's go eat first, otherwise the food will get cold." Dido simply walked into the restaurant with her husband.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Here, have another one." Clotokatax forked another piece of cod and put it on Dido's plate.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I'm full and can't eat any more." Dido forked the cod back to Clotokatax.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Are you full so quickly? You are pregnant now, so you should eat more." Crotokatax advised with concern.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I'm only over three months old and I don't have such a big appetite. Eat quickly. You didn't eat much just now." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then go for a walk in the yard. It's good for your health."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yeah." Dido She nodded in response and looked at her husband who was engrossed in eating fish, her eyes full of love: When she agreed to King Davos to marry Crotoka Tax, it was completely forced by the situation. Didn't she know that she was married when she got married? The husband was also dissatisfied with the marriage, but at that time she knew that Crotokatax had become the support of herself and the entire Magonid family in the Kingdom of Theonia, so she tried her best to She found a way to make this young husband fall in love with her, and in the process, she gradually fell in love with him, not only because of his identity and appearance, but also because of his gentleness and his love for women. respect.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In this era, whether in Theonia or Carthage, men who truly respect women are so rare. This is one of the reasons why the arrogant and independent Dido never got married, and Crotocathak Si has been influenced by Davos since he was a child, and this habit has been deeply rooted in his bones, so Dido feels that he is very lucky.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, she always felt a little uneasy in her heart. After all, she was several years older than Clotokatax, and she was almost 30 now. Moreover, her mother-in-law, Kristoya, seemed not to have a very good impression of her. , so she not only cares about her husband meticulously in life, but also tries her best to help him in his career. She believes that in this way, even if she gets old and loses her lust in the future, Crotokatax will not be willing to leave her. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Today, Konya came to see me." Dido said softly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Konia?" Clotokatax couldn't remember who this person was for a moment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The wife of Licinius Stolo, the judge of Rome Demo."
  </font>
