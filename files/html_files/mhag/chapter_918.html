   Chapter 918 Weispa's worries
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Father, the hot water is ready. You go take a bath first, and I will let the servants prepare dinner." Andrea said again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the beginning, the establishment of the Tulii Hot Spring Bathhouse can be said to have changed the living habits of the Theonians. Coupled with the strong recommendation of the doctors at Tulii Hospital, the Theonians began to regard bathing as a kind of Most of the elders are practitioners of health care methods that can remove fatigue, eliminate diseases, and benefit the body and mind, especially for the elderly.

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the hot spring baths located on the banks of the Tino River are far away from the city of Thurii, and it is really inconvenient to go back and forth every day. Therefore, building a good bathroom in one's own mansion has become a goal pursued by the kingdom's important ministers and wealthy people. King Davos, who was still favored by Hades, came up with an effective method, and after a period of experiments, the craftsmen successfully created a new family bathroom similar to a hot spring bath, which once again became the subject of the kingdom's people eager to imitate it. Object.

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This kind of bathroom uses the principle of hot and cold convection, which can not only quickly heat the entire pool of water, but also the hot air generated when boiling water can be effectively used to heat the bathroom floor. It is convenient and comfortable, and it was quickly promoted in the Kingdom. Come on.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since this kind of bathroom was built at home, Weisba fell in love with it and made bathing a habit that he must do before going to bed every night.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing what his daughter-in-law said, Weisba nodded, looked at the bathroom next to the main building, and was about to walk in that direction when he suddenly felt something was missing, so he asked, "Is Lucrez home from school?" ?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's a bit early to finish school today, but he went to play with Eunice and Apox. Princess Christoya wanted to keep him for dinner, so he won't come back until later."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This child has had a good relationship with the royal family since he was a child! It seems that when he grows up in the future, we won't have to worry about him too much!..." Weisba sighed happily for a while, then suddenly turned around and said: "I... I want to resign as the rotating chairman of the Senate...what do you think?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Andrea was stunned for a moment, looked at her father-in-law, and asked softly: "Why did father suddenly have this idea?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I'm getting older and my energy is running out. Now there are so many affairs in the kingdom that I really can't handle them anymore..." Weisba let out a long sigh. Now that he had spoken out the thoughts he had been holding in his heart for a long time, he simply continued. Said: "I used to occupy this position because I wanted to give our Lucanians... to earn more benefits for our family. Later, the Lucanian area developed very well, with Kesima, Urazha , Lizaru... They have all become senators, and our family has also established a firm foothold in the kingdom. Bagule and Asistes have always been under the great care of His Majesty. I no longer miss this position, but I You've still been in this position, do you know why?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Andrea has been with Weisba for more than ten years. After thinking about his temperament, she naturally had a rough answer, but she shook her head pretending not to know.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "That's for Butler!" Weisba said seriously, then looked at Andrea and said earnestly: "Bagule has been working outside these years, and the time he has spent at home is too short. Now it's time to He returned to Thurii and had a good reunion with our whole family! But with his current status in the kingdom, except for the position of rotating chairman of the Senate, other positions are not suitable for him. But becoming the rotating chairman is not that easy, Only one senator from Lucania can hold this position. If I quit early, there will probably be another senator who will take the position, and Bagule will have no chance!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Weisba said this, he was thinking of Hermon. He hesitated and said to his daughter-in-law: "You are so close to Princess Kristoya...can you...can you let her talk to His Majesty when she has the opportunity?" By the way, after I resign from the position of rotating chairman, let Bagule take over, so that I can rest assured..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Andrea felt embarrassed after hearing this. Under Weisba's gaze, she said tactfully: "Father, as far as I know, His Majesty has strict orders not to allow people in the family to interfere in political affairs. Princess Christoya also Never mention this matter in front of His Majesty..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Andrea saw Weisba's expression changing with disappointment, and she quickly said: "But I will try my best to ask the princess to do this for me."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "That's right. When Butler comes back, you and your wife can have a good time together. I'm still looking forward to having another grandson." Weisba had a smile on his face.

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While the Spartan army was fighting hard in Central Greece, the Spartan King Agesilaus was living leisurely in the rear.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On this day, his friend Xenophon came to visit the mansion and was warmly welcomed by him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Xenophon, you haven't come to see me for a long time! I thought you thought I was old and useless!" Agesilaus excitedly held his arm and patted him hard with the other hand. Patted him on the shoulder.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I have been busy writing the historical facts about the Greek mercenary expedition to Persia some time ago. I just finished it yesterday and came over to visit you." Xenophon explained.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Mercenary expedition to Persia?! Are you talking about the time you were hired by Cyrus the Younger 20 years ago to help him fight against Artaxerxes? I wonder if I have a chance to read it?" Agesilaus He smiled and asked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "King Agesilaus, you have been fighting in Asia Minor for many years and have a deep understanding of the Persian army. I was just asking you to read it and help me point out the errors and omissions in it." Xenophon said seriously and took something from his arms. Produce a book cut from papyrus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's okay for you to ask us Spartans to teach you how to lead troops to fight, but if you ask us to tell you how to write, isn't that a joke!" Agesilaus teased, laughing, taking the book, and then After flipping through a few pages, I was gradually attracted by the words in the book and read attentively.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing this, Xenophon became more confident in the book he wrote. He sat quietly and waited.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After nearly half an hour, Agesilaus raised his head, rubbed his sore eyes, looked at Xenophon, and praised repeatedly: "It is very well written! It is very exciting! If you were not here, I would really I want to read it in one sitting."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Then I can go." Xenophon stood up pretending to be serious.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two laughed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You told me about Cyrus the Younger before, and you admired him quite a lot. But in my opinion, at least in terms of military matters, he is still relatively immature, otherwise he would not have rushed out of the battle to die when he had the upper hand. , putting the entire army in danger." Agesilaus patted the book on the table with his hand and expressed his opinion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xenophon nodded but said nothing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I glanced through it briefly and found that in this book, you described Davos more than others, and there were also many omens and prophecies about him..." Agesilaus touched the Book, said slowly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xenophon said frankly: "That's true! In fact, the mercenaries were able to break out of the pursuit of the Persian army and finally returned to Greece. Davos played an important role in it. Even Chrysops It is not as great as his contribution, which is an unavoidable fact. But for me, I believe that Davos has indeed been favored by Hades, otherwise it will be difficult for you to believe that a man from the countryside of Thessaly, The recruit who had never received any education and had hardly participated in the war had been unknown before. When our mercenaries were in dire straits, he suddenly turned into a famous general with a smart mind, flexible tactics and decisive command. This should be The gods' blessing on us mercenaries is our luck!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, what was once the mercenary's luck has now become Sparta's biggest trouble!" Agesilaus sighed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xenophon did not speak. He suddenly remembered the first time he met Davos. The seemingly ordinary young man kept talking about the shortcomings of Athens and Sparta's political system. He was really amazed. He I still remember: when he couldn't help but ask "Where is the best political system in the world today?", the young man smiled and did not answer. Is today's Theonia Kingdom the answer he gave?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I heard some news recently. Those who fled to the Peloponnese from across the Adriatic Sea more than ten years ago are gathering an army to prepare to cross the sea to regain the territory they once lost. It is said that they even got your Sparta. Although there is a war going on in Theonia, I think this is not a very wise approach for Sparta." Xenophon reminded tactfully.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I also raised objections at the council of elders, but they couldn't listen... Alas, you also know my current situation..." Agesilaus said helplessly, looking slightly depressed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xenophon knew what he meant.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A few months earlier, Agesilaus had defended Sphdelias (the Spartan garrison general at Thespia, who had plotted and failed to attack the Athenian port of Piraeus), which had caused Sphdelias to Delias was not punished, which eventually led to the angry Athenians allying with Thebes and declaring war on Sparta, which made the fighting for the Spartan allies in Central Greece difficult. The Spartan people regretted it, and they began to blame Agesilaus, believing that it was his protection that allowed the stupid Sphodelias to go unpunished, resulting in such a bad situation today.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the people of Sparta did not have as much influence on the government as other democratic city-states, their dissatisfaction still affected the Council of Elders and the censors. The censors approached Agesilaus and Sverdeli several times. Yas talked and wanted to investigate whether there was bribery between them, and the Council of Elders made a decision, claiming that King Agesilaus of Sparta had a military service of 40 years, and all the citizens of his contemporaries had already No longer on the battlefield, he still continues to fight for Sparta. This is really admirable and an example for the citizens. However, his health is not good and he is getting older. For the sake of his health, the elders discussed the matter. Will decide not to let the respected Agesilaus lead the army to fight again and run around...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Council of Elders kept saying that it was for the good of Agesilaus, but with the development of Sparta's political system, the king had very little power left. Being the commander of Sparta and leading troops in battle was their greatest power, and it was also their greatest power. Agesilaus lost his greatest prestige, which was equivalent to being idle.
