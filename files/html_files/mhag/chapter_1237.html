   Chapter 1237 Guest
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Because the Theonia Games will be held soon. It is said that its scale is very large. Not only all regions in the country, but also all allies of the kingdom are invited to participate, so during this period not only is the game All the restaurants and hotels in Li, as well as the officials and people are buying large quantities of pottery in preparation for receiving a large number of guests during the games." The shop owner said excitedly: "I originally planned to send someone to Athens by boat to inform you. Seize the time to make more pottery and bring it to Turii for sale..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Don't worry, I have received the news from Master Sostatus and have made arrangements. There will be more soon. The pottery is shipped from Athens." Hesklaus put on a confident look and encouraged: "If sales surge in the next two months, I will double your salary."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Hesklaus Si is the boss, and the shopkeeper is just his employee, but he is not condescending and arrogant at all when talking to him, and he is even a bit flattering. There is no way to call the shopkeeper a real native of Thurii, and Peleus only joined a few years ago. He spent a lot of money to hire the Holy Kingdom of Theonia, but it played a very important role in establishing his pottery shop in the Turiyi market.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The shop owner immediately expressed his gratitude and reminded: "Lord Sostatus has sent people over several times to ask if the batch of goods they requested has arrived. Do you think we should send people to notify them immediately?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hesk Rouse slapped his forehead: "I was just so happy that I almost forgot about this!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is precisely because of Sostatus's support that Heskraus is where he is today. He still wants to continue to rely on Sostatus's support. With help, he will reach the top of Theonia's business community in the future. How can he dare to slack off? He quickly said: "Yes! Yes! You send someone immediately!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After saying that, regardless of fatigue, he personally led people to hand it over to Sostatu. Si's batch of exquisite pottery was taken out of the wooden box and placed in the backyard of the pottery shop for the other party to send people to inspect.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Unexpectedly, after noon, Saustatus had not sent anyone yet, and Heskraus did not dare to leave. As a result, the original plan to take his son to the nearby Christoya restaurant for a delicious meal had to be scrapped. He had no choice but to let the clerk buy some bread to deal with it. For this, Lilrias cried and made a fuss while hugging the duck, and was even scolded by him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the afternoon, Sostatus' men came over and brought him good news: he was invited to the banquet held by Sostatus in the evening.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hesklaus danced with joy, and any resentment he had before immediately disappeared without a trace.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, before that, both of them have to complete the formal procedures for the sale. The seller lists the price of the goods, the buyer pays, and then the seller takes out the payment slip received from the pottery market management office (it is said to be received, but in fact it is What you have to pay is that the price is not high. After all, it is made of paper, and now only the Crystal Chamber of Commerce in the Holy Kingdom of Theonia can make it in the entire Mediterranean.) Fill in the type, quantity and price of the goods sold. , signed by both parties in duplicate, the buyer takes one copy and delivers it to the management office of the market, and can get a certain amount of tax refund, and the payment slip in his hand is left at the management office as a voucher for tax collection at the end of the month.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Ministry of Commerce of Theonia adopts this approach so that people in Theonia will actively ask for payment slips from merchants when purchasing goods and submit them to the market management office to obtain additional money, but in fact they receive this part of the tax refund It had already been added to the price of the goods, and was returned to the Kingdom's treasury when taxes were finally paid.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And the Ministry of Commerce also stipulates that the public can report merchants who refuse to give payment orders, and the management office will impose heavy fines on them, and part of the fines will be awarded to the people who report; in addition, the buyers and sellers have not made formal purchases. Instead of going through formalities, the public can report the transaction behind closed doors. Once proven to be true, the reporting public will also be rewarded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Due to these stringent measures of the Ministry of Commerce, the vast majority of people doing business in Theonia will abide by the regulations. After all, for a small profit, if you violate the law, you will face a fine of confiscating your property, or in the worst case, you will be permanently deprived of your business in Theonia. If Niya's business qualifications were to be compromised, or even expelled from the kingdom, it would be too much of a loss.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, even if Sostatus had shares in Heskraus's Athenian pottery farm, he would follow formal buying and selling procedures to avoid being reported by uninformed people and making him disgraced.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, compared with the traditional Greek tax collection method led by Athens, the tax collection method implemented by the Holy Kingdom of Theonia is obviously more beneficial to merchants and can promote the good development of commerce. Therefore, when Theonia and mainland Greece After the trade was fully developed, many Greek merchants preferred to settle and do business in Theonia. Of course, there were also Greek city-states that tried to use this better tax collection method, but due to limited national power, they eventually failed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Heskraus had opened a shop in Thurii for more than two years with the support of Sostatus, this was the first time he was invited to his home. For the sake of caution, he decided to prepare in advance and arrive early to show off. respect.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After being dressed up, put on brand new clothes, bought good gifts, took Lillias and of course the duck in the shop, they were ready to go.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the pottery market is a bit far away from Sostatus and there are crowds of people along the way, and it is early June and the weather is hot, I am afraid that by the time we get to the house, we will be sweaty and gray, so Hesklaus adopted the shopkeeper's suggestion. A sedan was hired.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Saustatus's mansion is in the eastern outer city, very close to the inner city of Turii. He took the initiative to return the inner city mansion left by his father Kunogorata to the kingdom so that the kingdom could settle down well. The Haka brothers came to Turiyi, so Davos was very grateful for this, and specifically instructed the Turiyi City Hall "not to let Kunogolata's son suffer". According to the difference in land prices in the inner and outer cities at that time, the final settlement was Status moved to a large piece of land in the outer city.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He built houses on the entire land and divided it into two mansions, one for himself and one for his brother. Each mansion was twice the size of the senator's house.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Welcome! Welcome!" Sostatus heard the servant's report and came to the door to greet him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lord Saustatus, this is my first time at your residence for a banquet. I was afraid that I would be late because I didn't know the way, so I came a little early. Please forgive me!" Hesklaus said respectfully.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, Sostatus is only the president of the Turii Chamber of Commerce and a member of the Turii City Council. He does not hold any official position. Strictly speaking, the title "Sir" is not appropriate to use on him, but in recent years, The people of Theonia gradually used this official title to some highly respected celebrities, making the term secular.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's okay, there are several guests who came earlier than you." Saustatus waved his hand, then saw Lyrias behind Hesklaus, immediately bent down and asked with a smile: " "Kid, what's your name?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lillias shyly hid behind Hesklaus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Heskraus quickly explained: "My lord, this is my son Lyrias. This time he insists on coming to Thurii with me, and I dare not leave him alone -" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It doesn't matter, I I told you that you can bring your family members." Saustatus said disapprovingly, and then lowered his head to tease Lilias: "Hey, little guy, if you call me uncle, I will give you a good thing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " After hearing this, Rias bravely shouted: "...Hello, uncle!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, not bad!" Saustatus nodded with satisfaction and quickly took out something from his arms. He had heard the slave say before Heskraus came to the door with a child, so he was prepared in advance: "Look, what is this?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lyrias opened his eyes wide and looked at the object in Sostatus's hand: a gilded gold ball as big as a palm. The character statue has handsome features and a resolute expression. He is holding a football in one hand and swinging his arm with the other hand, making a gesture of sprinting forward. The whole statue is delicately carved and lifelike, giving people a sense of nervousness when watching a game.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not only Lirias fell in love with him at first sight, but Hesklaus was also attracted.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's a football star statue," Lilias blurted out.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Thessaly was incorporated into the Sacred Kingdom of Theonia, the sport of rugby was also brought to the land of Thessaly by Theonian soldiers and immigrants, and it soon became popular and became popular in Thessaly. With the strong support of the regional administrator Hilos, rugby matches have been organized throughout the Thessaly region.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This is no ordinary football star statue!" Saustatus turned the statue in his hand and showed off like a child: "This is the most famous rugby star in the entire kingdom, setting a record for five consecutive kingdom rugby finals. With a record of touchdowns, His Highness Anteblis, the third son of the great King Davos, is also the most popular star among children! Moreover, this statue was made by the most outstanding sculptor in the kingdom, Alex He carved the mold himself, and he was also the son-in-law of King Davos the Great. Because the production process is too complicated and the output is very small, this statue is difficult to buy on the market."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After saying these words, Saustatus took the statue to Lilrias stuffed it in his little hand: "Now it belongs to you."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Thank you, uncle!" Lilrias's "thank you" came from the bottom of his heart, and he couldn't wait to start playing with it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This... this is too expensive." Heskraus subconsciously wanted to refuse.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's just a gadget." Saustatus looked quite nonchalant at the moment. He turned around and said to his servant: "Go and call Sosikles."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then he led the father and son into the yard. While saying: "The quality of the pottery you shipped this time is very high, and it will definitely be very popular among the nobles in the inner city! Thanks to you, several of my pottery shops in the inner city are now very famous, and many businessmen are here Ask about the origin of my pottery…"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thanks to Lamperucci for the tip!
