  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This order... Patroclus emphasized it yesterday. There are no Gallic soldiers in our army. I believe the soldiers will not violate it easily..." Liza Lu was talking, pretending to remember something: "Oh, I forgot who said that you are from Larissa?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lizaru's words were like a stone hitting the bottom of Matonis's heart, causing a stir. Having forgotten those old memories, he did not quarrel with Lizaru as if they were joking. Instead, he turned to look to the northwest. After being in a daze for a while, he said sadly: "You remember wrong, I am not from Larissa, but I am from Larissa." He is an Oroson (the city-state of Thessaly northwest of Larissa, adjacent to the Epirus Mountains), a mountain man like you."

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After saying that, he called his staff officer: "Send someone immediately Rush to Peleus and inform Lord Hilos that we have captured his hometown." The

  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Please, Lizaru, I will take you to see the largest city in northern Thessaly." Matonis made an inviting gesture.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The largest city...is it as big as Thurii?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "How can it be compared with Thurii!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What about Crotone?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It can't compare!"

   Surrounded by soldiers , the two entered the city of Larissa on horseback, chatting and laughing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ……………………………………………………………………

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the main forces of Theonia successfully landed and captured the nearby coastal city-state, the transportation The fleet entered the port, quickly unloaded the army's auxiliary personnel, supplies, etc., and then began to return to Sparta and Messenia under the escort of the 1st Fleet Squadron.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not long after, the fleet in the Pagasa Bay of Thessaly received a notice from the clipper and immediately ordered the soldiers who were still pretending to pave the road on the Mildoros beach to return to the ship as soon as possible, because the fleet would then have to move the 13th The legionnaires were sent to the neighboring Gulf of Mariakos to land.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Thessaly defenders watched as the Theonian soldiers used straw and wooden planks to lay the road almost to the foot of the mountain. They were all ready to attack, but suddenly they saw the enemies retreating to the seaside to board the ship. Soon All warships and troop transports disappeared from their sight.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After squatting on the mountain for a long time, the delicious food that was about to reach his mouth suddenly ran away. This made Polyfulon feel depressed and uncomfortable. He immediately suggested to Polydorus: "We should let the fleet at the Philae port attack immediately. , We can't let Theonia's fleet come and leave as they please, and we have to bite off a piece of their flesh anyway!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Polydorus said cautiously: "It's not like you don't know that one of our fleets So I stayed in the port and didn't dare to attack because the number of Theonian warships in the bay far exceeded ours. Since the Theonians have withdrawn actively, there is no need to take this risk." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I suggested before that let The soldiers took the initiative to attack the enemies on the tidal flats, but you disagreed! Now I suggest that the fleet attack, but you disagree again! You just sit here and feel stupid, not daring to do anything. What is the use of being the military governor of Thessaly? !" Polyfulon danced and yelled angrily at his brother, tearing up the tent in anger and striding out of the camp.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The adjutant in the tent complained softly: "General, Polyfuron has gone too far, ignoring your -"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Forget it." Polydorus waved his hand helplessly: This younger brother of his has been very brave since he was a child. He is fiercely competitive, and even more violent when he grows up. He has no respect for his elders, and he has long been used to it.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because of this, the eldest brother Jason did not dare to let the youngest brother take on any important responsibilities. Instead, he always asked him to work with him. He originally hoped to make him change, but unfortunately he has not made any progress so far...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Polydor Russ put this annoying matter behind him. He shouldered the heavy responsibility of defending Thessaly and was unwilling to cause more trouble, so he allowed the Theonia fleet to leave, but he still had doubts in his heart: Could it be that Theonia They dispatched such a huge fleet, but ended up spending most of the day here in vain, and then left with nothing?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Could there be any other conspiracy?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While Polydorus was thinking, he did not forget to give the order to the adjutant: "Send soldiers to burn the road paved by the Theonians in the tidal flat."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, sir."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Adjutant As soon as they left the tent, Larissa's messenger arrived at the camp.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The Theonian army landed on the coast of Peleus!!" Polydorus was shocked when he heard the news, and his uneasiness was finally confirmed. The Theonians caught him off guard by using the tactics of attacking from the east and attacking from the west.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, he knew very well: because the Theonian army landed on the coast of Mildorus with great fanfare, he mobilized citizen soldiers from surrounding city-states to come to support. Now the defense in the west is very empty. Once the Theonian army passes through the pass, Road, rushing into the northern plains, the consequences will be disastrous. Peleus can be captured, but the valley pass must be blocked!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Polydorus made up his mind and immediately issued an order: two thousand Philae militiamen were stationed at the coastal camp of Mildorus, and the rest of the troops immediately rushed to the valley pass camp.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Considering that the city of Larissa is more than 100 miles away from the coast of Mildorus, and the valley pass is even further away, it has taken a lot of time for the Larissa messenger to arrive here. I am afraid that the battle situation on Peleus' side has changed a lot. ... Just in case, Polydorus ordered the only 500 cavalry under his command to quickly reinforce the valley pass.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After all the orders were issued, Polydorus felt relieved. He led the main force of more than 10,000 troops to advance towards the valley pass at a fast marching speed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When night fell, the Thessalian army had marched less than 40 miles, but Polydorus was worried about the battle ahead and did not dare to let the soldiers stop and rest. He just asked them to light torches and continue moving forward.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It didn't take long before Polydorus finally got the exact news from the front, and this news was brought back by the cavalry troops he sent before.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It turned out that the Thessalian cavalry rushed from the coast of Mildorus in the southeast to the valley pass due north, and did not encounter the Theonian army rushing to Larissa. When they arrived at the valley pass camp, they found The camp was already full of Theonian soldiers in black helmets. The surprised Thessalian cavalry dared to go forward and fight. They were also worried about the safety of Larissa, who was not far away, so they turned to the south to explore. As a result, I happened to see the Theonian army attacking the city of Larissa.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Are you sure that the Theonian army has captured the city of Larissa?!" Polydorus asked the cavalry general with a gloomy face.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "General, I'm not sure, because the Theonians had discovered us at that time and sent a cavalry to attack us. Since their number far exceeded us, we did not respond, but we also took them around. After a while, they chose to retreat." The cavalry general tried his best to express the bravery of his team: "During this process, we heard the cheers of the Theonian soldiers. The cheers were very loud. I think it was the Theonian soldiers. The demi-humans captured Larissa."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It should be?" Polyfulon listened and said dissatisfied: "Since you haven't seen it with your own eyes, don't make random guesses. Larissa is a big city, and it can't be so fast. It was easily captured by a Theonian army that had just landed!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The cavalry general was a little aggrieved. Just as he was about to defend himself, Polydorus asked: "How many people are there in the Theonian army?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because It's getting dark, so I can't see clearly, and the Theonian cavalry rushed up quickly, and there was no more time to observe... But according to my judgment, there should be more than 20,000 people." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Another one' It should be'..." Polyfuron once again expressed his dissatisfaction.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Thank you for your hard work. Go down first and let the soldiers have a good rest." Polydorus interrupted Polyfuron in time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the cavalry general left, Polyfulon shouted again: "That guy must be talking nonsense. You should let the army speed up towards Larissa!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Shut up! I am the commander of this army. There is no need to do anything. You come to dictate!" The bad news that came one after another made Polydorus feel very bad. He finally couldn't bear the noise of his younger brother and shouted sternly: "Go back to your own team immediately, not here. Disturb my thinking!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Polydorus was unabashedly angry at his brother for the first time, making Polyfulon a little dazed. Then his face turned red and he suddenly let out a heart-rending roar. Everyone around him was startled, and then he turned around and left angrily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Polydorus knew that Polyfulon was annoyed by him, but now he was in no mood to apologize or comfort him. He had to quickly come up with a way to solve the current predicament. After some thinking, he finally did A decision was made: the entire army stopped advancing and immediately returned to the camp outside Philae!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, he sent several sentinels to Larissa to find out the enemy's situation as soon as possible.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As the temporary military governor of Thessaly, Polydorus knew very well that the troops in Larissa and its surrounding areas had been drained. If the incoming Theonian army exceeded 20,000 people, it would be difficult for the Larissa people to resist. their attack, so the cavalry general's judgment was probably correct.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was completely meaningless for the army to rush to reinforce Larissa late at night. Instead, it was easily attacked by the Theonians.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This Theonian army took only one day to complete the landing on the coast of Peleus, break through the valley pass, and capture Larissa. The combat effectiveness was quite terrifying. The Thessalian troops he led could not be the best. opponent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was precisely because of these thoughts that he decided not to act rashly, but to concentrate his forces to defend Philae, and then send people to notify Jason and request reinforcements while observing the enemy's movements and looking for fighter opportunities.
