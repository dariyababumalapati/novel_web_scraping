<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because Leotychides once again received an urgent request for help from Minoa, the Carthaginian army attacked fiercely for days. The siege equipment they manufactured caused heavy casualties to the Minoa defenders. Minoa could no longer withstand it. . At the same time, he also received news from Selinus. The fact that he led his army to leave the port of Selinus by ship could not be concealed from the Carthaginian sentries patrolling the seaside. The next day, the Carthaginians attacked Selinus. Sicheng launched an attack.

<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   All this made Leotychides eager to deal with the Carthaginian army under the city of Gera as soon as possible, so after discussing with the reinforcements of the Gera people and Camanlina, he decided to have a battle with the Carthaginians. battle.

</font>
<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the early morning, Leotychides led 8,000 soldiers of the Eighth Legion, 1,000 cavalry of the 4th Cavalry Legion, 5,000 Gela soldiers, and 3,000 Camanlina reinforcements, a total of 17,000 people, out of the city of Gela , after marching four miles westward, facing the Carthage military camp, they set up a formation.

<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The huge troop transport fleet entering the port of Gela could not be concealed from the Carthaginian army building a camp near the sea. Therefore, the Carthaginian army did not attack the city in the past two days. Instead, under Kisgo's repeated persuasion, Hasdru Ba summoned about 2,000 soldiers stationed at Echinom, leaving only a few hundred. In addition, he also issued an order to the Carthaginian army under his command that participated in the siege of Enna, causing 1,500 soldiers to trek through the mountains and arrive at starry night.

<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   One of Kisgo's words moved Hasdrubal: "...According to the situation observed by the sentry, there are no less than 200 Theonian troop transport ships, so at least 10,000 Theonian soldiers entered the Jeonian La. In this way, the number of defenders in the city is about the same as our number of soldiers. Therefore, it is impossible for the Theonians just to defend the city, but to defeat us, because with the huge army led by Lord Mago In comparison, we have a small number of people, but are closest to the Theonia territory, which poses a great threat to them. As long as we can defeat the Theonia army, we can quickly complete the goal promised by Lord Mago in the Senate - to The Theonians were driven out of Sicily, and Hasdrubal you can also be praised by the people of Carthage!..."

</font>
<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So after learning that the Theonian army had left the city of Jela, Hasdrubal couldn't wait to start gathering troops in the camp.
  </font>
</font>
<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While the Theonian coalition was arraying, Hasdrubal also led the army to leave the camp and came to the opposite side of the Theonian coalition and began to line up.
  </font>
</font>
<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hasdrubal's army consisted of 10,000 mixed Phoenician and Numibian troops, 4,000 Iberian soldiers, 2,500 Lusitanian warriors, 600 Celtic warriors, and more than 1,000 Special soldiers, a total of about 18,500 soldiers.
  </font>
</font>
<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the place where the two sides were about to fight was a flat grassland with an unobstructed view for several miles, the Theonian coalition started to line up first, thus giving Hasdrubal and Kisgow a chance to observe.
  </font>
</font>
<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The battle formation that the Theonia coalition is arranging is about three miles long. They are all heavy infantry. They overlap one another like a long iron wall.
  </font>
</font>
<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because the unique black helmets and black armor of the Theonian army were extremely conspicuous in the military formation, Hasdrubal first attracted the attention of Hasdrubal. He found that the Theonian army was mainly concentrated on the right side of the battle formation (Theonian army). The left wing of the Theonian coalition), so after a brief discussion, he and Gisgo began to form a formation: 7,000 mixed Phoenician and Numibian troops on the left, facing the Theonian legionnaires .

<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This army was specially formed by the Magonid family after they prepared to develop in Iberia. Due to various considerations, they did not recruit Carthaginians at that time. The Nike allies recruited a lot of poor people and refugees, starting with 20,000 people and reaching 40,000 at the peak. They were the main force for the Magonid family to establish a foothold in Iberia and expand their territory. For more than ten years, under the leadership of Mago and Hasdrubal, they have fought countless battles with the fierce natives of Iberia. They are the most important force that the Magonid family relies on. This time to attack Sicily, Mago brought 20,000 people, and 10,000 soldiers stayed in southern Iberia.
  </font>
</font>
<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the center, Hasdrubal prepared to let the remaining 3,000 Phoenician and Numibian soldiers and 2,000 Iberian infantry guard it.
  </font>
</font>
<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Iberian infantry is composed of indigenous people living in southern Iberia. Although they are not as fierce as their distant relatives, the Lusitanians, they have a large population and are more united. They once gave the Magonides family a stronghold in Iberia. The conquest of the south caused a lot of trouble, and it took about 6 or 7 years to get most of the tribes to surrender to Mago.
  </font>
</font>
<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, Mago did not dare to enslave the southern Iberian race like Carthage enslaved the Numibians. Instead, he listened to his nephew Haka's opinion: as long as they surrendered, they would not be deprived of their territory and allowed to be in their jurisdiction. They live freely within the country, do not tax them, do not interfere in the internal affairs of the tribes, and also trade daily necessities with these tribes at lower prices...
  </font>
</font>
<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But these races also have obligations that they must abide by: not to violate the laws of the colony (this law is not Carthage law, but a law enacted by Haka based on the situation in southern Iberia). When the Magonid family launches a war with foreign countries, , they need to provide troops. Of course, after victory, they will also receive generous spoils of war; in addition, wars between tribes are not allowed. Once conflicts arise, they will be coordinated and resolved by the Magonid family, which is tantamount to letting the The Magonid family became the chief leaders of the tribes in southern Iberia. The tribe's interests were not harmed, but they received a lot of benefits. The resistance to Magonide was naturally greatly reduced.
  </font>
</font>
<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So far, Mago's territory in southern Iberia has not only remained generally stable, but also has a large number of free soldiers, which has greatly reduced the military expenses for maintaining the security of the territory and also reduced the number of mercenary soldiers (mainly Phoenician and Numibian troops), in this landing Mago brought 15,000 Iberian infantry.
  </font>

<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The right wing was composed of 2,500 Lusitanian fighters and 2,000 Libyan soldiers. The right wing had the smallest number of soldiers, but Hasdrubal pinned his hopes of victory on the right wing because of the presence of Lusitanian warriors.
  </font>
</font>
<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Lusitanians are actually a branch of the Celts. They are tall and strong, run fast and powerful, and are good at using large shields and daggers. Their use of weapons is similar to that of their relatives, the Iberians. The infantry is similar, except that the Iberian infantry is stable, but they are more violent when fighting and more suitable for attack, so Hasdrubal ranked them on the far right, hoping to use them to open the way to victory.
  </font>
</font>
<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As for the 600 Celtic warriors, Hasdrubal left them behind the center, not because he had the habit of retaining reserves, but because he had just vaguely observed Theonia The coalition had many cavalry.
  </font>
</font>
<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hasdrubal is not like Monte Adeno. He and his uncle Mago have carefully studied the past victories of the Theonians and found that the cavalry plays a very important role in them. They even used this to During the war to conquer southern Iberia, cavalry was used many times to defeat the enemy and reverse the situation. After all, Carthage had very rich cavalry resources, including Carthaginian cavalry, Numibian cavalry, Mauritanian allied cavalry, and even Lusitanian cavalry. There are also many cavalry, and this time there are more than 7,000 cavalry in the army led by Mago.
  </font>
</font>
<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, since Hasdrubal had to lead the army over the mountains, raid the Sikels, and then attack the rear of the Theonian army, the cavalry became a burden, leaving no cavalry in the current army, so he must stay The Celts came down to protect another unit and jointly defend against the attack of the Theonian cavalry on the flanks of the military formation.
  </font>
</font>
<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, the Celtics are unruly and difficult to cooperate with other troops in the battle formation. On the contrary, they will hinder the attack. This is also the reason why they were singled out. For this reason, Hasdrubal also asked Kisgow to take charge. Behind the center, one of the tasks is to restrain this Celtic force.
  </font>
</font>
<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After making these arrangements, Hasdrubal ran to the right wing. He wanted to personally attack the enemy with the Lusitanians. The leader of a Carthaginian army actually lined up with a group of natives. And he was still at the forefront of the military formation. This was indeed unique for the Carthaginian nobles. Even Mago could not do it, but Hasdrubal used this to win over the Iberians, Lusitanians, Even the Celtics respect him and everyone is willing to obey his command.

<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Leotychides received the reward from the scout cavalry and learned that the Carthaginian army had left the camp, he settled down: today's battle will definitely continue.
  </font>
</font>
<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He began a more detailed formation: the 6,000 heavy infantry of the Eighth Army were arranged from the right wing to the center, with only 8 rows. In this way, the Eighth Army occupied half of the entire length of the army; It is the heavy infantry of Gera, and they increase the rows to 14 columns; to the left of the Gera people is the heavy infantry of Camanlina, also with 14 columns...
  </font>
</font>
<br/>
<br/>
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The formation of the Theonian coalition is like a hatchet, with a thinner wooden handle on the right and a thick blade on the left. The reason why Leotychides arranged it this way was out of necessity: the Theonian Army and the South Coast After several months of joint fighting with the friendly armies, he had a deeper understanding of the armies of these Greek city-states. Most of them had more skilled heavy infantry combat skills and were brave in battle, but their discipline was loose and the battle could not last long. If defeated, it would be easier to collapse. Out of concern for them, they thickened their array. In this way, even if the frontline soldiers who were wearing thick Greek heavy infantry armor and had limited mobility were timid and wanted to retreat, they had to push forward under the push of the rear soldiers, otherwise they would be more likely to die from the enemy. attack and trample on one's own comrades.
