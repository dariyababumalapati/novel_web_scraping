   Chapter 1285 Preparations to Attack Persia from Egypt
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, Asistes knew that the current focus of the kingdom was still on the smooth transfer of power in Egypt and the war against Persia, so he went on to say: "It is precisely because of the Egyptian monks this year We have suffered a lot in the past. When we expressed our goodwill to them, they quickly moved closer to us. Not only did they actively help us promote the legalization of the Kingdom's rule in Egypt, but they also used part of their food reserves to help us solve the supply of military rations.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, Amenhotep also proposed on behalf of the temple monks that they are willing to continue to provide military rations for the kingdom's army attacking Persia, as long as we give them part of the spoils -" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This request must not be agreed!" Ma Tonys objected loudly: "The spoils obtained by the army were obtained by the blood of the soldiers. 1/3 must be turned over to the national treasury, 1/3 must be turned over to the Ministry of Military Affairs, and 1/3 belongs to the soldiers themselves. What the soldiers gained There aren't many in the first place. It would have been nice if we didn't kill these fat-minded Egyptian priests who dared to compete with us for food!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Silence!" Davos saw that most of the legion commanders, led by Matonis, had serious expressions on their faces. Angry, he had to keep a straight face and warned in a deep voice: "Don't say these words casually in the future! Persia is the richest in the world. The wealth accumulated over the past hundred years is countless. As long as we defeat Persia, the spoils that the soldiers can get are far away." It is better than before, and there is no big loss in allocating part of the temple to Egypt.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the contrary, you should know very well that for the kingdom's army who is far away from home and fighting in foreign countries, the most important thing is not the spoils of war, but food! In war During this period, food was more valuable than gold and could not be bought even with money. If there was a shortage of military rations, no matter how brave the soldiers were, they would be easily defeated! We only paid for a little loot that we might get in the future, but in exchange for what the Egyptian temples can provide immediately Plenty of food, this business is simply too profitable for us!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this point, Davos looked at Asistes and asked: "If I agree to their request, the food they provide can supply us. How long will
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   it take for all the armies?" Asistes carefully estimated and then replied: "According to what Amenhotep told me, it can probably support the kingdom's army in Egypt for more than two months, and in two Many months later, Egypt will enter the harvest season, and the food harvested in the Nile Delta can continue to provide security for the army..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos looked around the generals: "Everyone, have you heard this? Now it's up to you to decide whether We should accept the request of the Egyptian monks!" 
      Matonis' face was slightly red, but his tone was firm: "As long as it can reduce the burden on the kingdom and facilitate the army's operations, it is worth the soldiers losing a little
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   loot
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   . Of course we will agree!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tonys' words were immediately recognized by other generals.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos smiled and nodded, but from the corner of his eye, he saw Chalcedis hesitate to speak, and immediately asked: "Chalcidius, do you have anything to add?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty." Chalcedis had no choice but to say He said truthfully: "According to what I know, the request of the Egyptian monks is not because they are greedy, but because they have such a tradition. In the past, after the Egyptian army went out to conquer the battlefield and won, they would offer the spoils to the temple. The temple will also donate rations to the army when they go on expeditions...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I'm thinking...after we defeat Persia, the kingdom may station troops in Egypt or nearby areas to consolidate these conquered areas. If these armies also follow the Egyptian According to this tradition, when they go to war, relying on Egypt alone may be enough to solve their military food supply, which will greatly reduce the burden on the kingdom." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Well, your idea is not bad!" Davos felt slightly surprised in his heart. , he did not expect that the temporary commander of the Egyptian army whom he personally favored would think so long-term while focusing on combat. While casting an approving look at Chalsidis, he said: "Herni, move this line I suggest you write it down and discuss it after the war is over."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Your Majesty."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos did not praise Chalcedis anymore. After all, his qualifications were not high among the generals present, and he was from Sicily. Paying too much attention to it might arouse the jealousy of some generals, so Davos immediately changed the subject: "Asistes, since Amenhotep is so sincere in cooperating with your work and supporting the kingdom in Egypt. If he wants to rule, then I will follow your suggestion in your letter and appoint him as the governor of Egypt... Well, what do the Egyptians call it?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Vizir, which means prime minister." Asistes responded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, appoint Amenhotep as the vizier, responsible for the administrative affairs of Upper Egypt." Davos said seriously: "And you are also the vizier, responsible for the governance of Lower Egypt. I will not appoint the minister in charge. , the Kingdom's Finance Department will soon send tax officials to centrally manage Egypt's finances and taxes. In addition, although Amenhotep is the vizier of Upper Egypt, his office must be in Memphis... Tapirus, You must make these things clear to Amenhotep!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Your Majesty." Tapirus responded: "This is what they did during the reign of Pharaoh Tanib. Our kingdom is stronger, but If Amenhotep makes these requests, he will be happy to agree."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As the founding monarch of Theonia, letting an Egyptian surrender combine the Egyptian high priest and vizier at the same time is actually equivalent to It was to give up the jurisdiction over Upper Egypt. Although this was only temporary, it also made the always tough Davos a little unwilling. He said with emphasis: "Although I made a promise not to immigrate to Egypt, but the assimilation and integration of Egypt Asistes is still your top priority in governing Egypt. I hope you can come up with a good way!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I understand, Your Majesty." Asistes, who has rich experience in governing foreign races, said confidently Answered: "There is a characteristic in Egypt. After the chief of a town becomes a pharaoh, the people of this town will be promoted and reused in a large amount. And many Egyptians believe that the reason why we Theonia can occupy Egypt is Naukrati Si played a big role in this, so we can naturally reuse a large number of Naukratis who have similar blood and culture to us, and are more willing to be close to us, thereby speeding up and stabilizing our rule in Lower Egypt. I have resigned myself to my
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   fate .
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As my assistant, Eurylochus, the former lord of Naucrates, also sent a number of young officials from Naucrates to Memphis to serve as translators and scribes. After confirming their ability and loyalty, he sent them to various places. The cities and towns hold important positions;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I decided to open all the towns along the coast of Egypt and strengthen trade with the kingdom's mainland, thereby breaking the closed state of Egypt and allowing the Egyptians to have more exchanges with us Theonians;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I hope to open Lower Egypt The children of the nobles were sent to Thurii to study, and they also wanted to establish many schools in Egypt so that the kingdom could send enough teachers to teach, so that the next generation of Egyptians could understand the power and prosperity of the kingdom and identify with the culture of the kingdom. Gradually, Consider yourself a citizen of Theonia and be proud of it..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos listened carefully, thought for a while, and then nodded with satisfaction and said: "Very good, write down all your thoughts, I want to read them carefully. Assi, you will govern Egypt, I will You can completely rest assured! But you have to note that Naukratis is not only very helpful to us in governing Egypt, but its strategic location is also very important to the kingdom! Once there is chaos in Egypt, as long as Naukratis is still there, Being loyal to the kingdom, reinforcements from the kingdom can easily land on the western coast of Egypt and quickly put down the rebellion. Therefore, there must be a garrison of the kingdom in Naukratis in the future!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I remember, Your Majesty." Asiste Si responded solemnly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos glanced at the generals who were listening drowsily, and said loudly: "Chasidis, you know the Egyptian army better, tell me, what is their combat effectiveness?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Chalsidis was excited and hurriedly He replied: "Your Majesty, the Egyptian army's combat effectiveness is not strong. Although their soldiers do not lack the courage to fight, most of their soldiers do not wear armor, they do not have heavy infantry, and there are not many cavalry. The only better ones are archers. , but their archers do not have as good offensive awareness and tactics as our light infantry. They usually hide behind the infantry's shield wall and attack the enemy from a distance. It is said that this tactic was learned from the Persians, and the tactics are relatively rigid. The only advantage may be that he can run fast..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The generals burst into laughter.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Where are their tanks?" Davos' tone remained calm.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Egyptian chariots are used to carry archers. They look scary. In fact, they are far less powerful than the Gauls' chariots. On the contrary, because the target is too large, they are easily attacked by our light infantry."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos After listening, he thought thoughtfully: "It seems that the Egyptian army will not help us in attacking Persia, but will become a burden..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty, the Egyptians are not helpless to us. They are hard-working and easy to obey, so they are very suitable." Become a servant of the army," Chalcides suggested.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Since you led your army to Egypt, what happened to the Persians in the north?" Davos asked again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This question made all the generals feel relieved and energetic.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I think it may be because the Persians did not expect that we would send troops to Egypt so soon. They lacked preparation, so they neither gathered the army in time to threaten the Egyptian border, nor directly led the army to invade Egypt... Until last month, I He led the main force of the army to move to Perramesses on the east side of the Nile Delta, and some of the troops even moved forward to the city of Daphnai (daphnai) closest to the eastern border. Only then did they attract the attention of the Egyptians, who sent more troops to Gaza City. "
