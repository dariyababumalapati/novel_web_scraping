   Chapter 1175 Battle of Tegea (1)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just in case, the First Cavalry Corps sent 500 cavalry to follow and protect them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The group of people quickly arrived near the city of Tegea, and from a distance saw thousands of Spartan soldiers spreading out in a north-south direction to the southwest of the city of Tegea. The scene was noisy and chaotic, and Tegea The cries of killing continued from the top of the city. It was obvious that the Spartans were still unwilling to give up the siege and were still making their final efforts.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing that the cavalry led by Crotocatacus continued to approach, the Spartan formation also sent many cavalry with the intention of driving them away.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to prevent accidents, Printors had to ask Crotokatax to retreat immediately.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the way back, Clotokatax saw Printoles frowning and deep in thought, and couldn't help but ask: "Is there anything wrong with the Spartans' formation?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " Thors came back to his senses and said in a deep voice: "Your Highness, have you seen those real Spartan warriors? They are actually lined up on the left wing of the array!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Printors' reminder, Croto Cartax recalled the scene he had seen before: in a battle formation that was several miles long, thousands of Spartan warriors wearing traditional red cloaks were indeed arrayed at the southernmost end.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotocathus spent some time in the staff office of the Ministry of War and participated in the study of previous battles that took place in the Mediterranean. He knew that due to their small population, the Spartans were very difficult to fight in larger battles. They rarely fought independently and almost always commanded coalition forces to fight. Sparta's own warriors were often concentrated on the right wing, relying on Sparta's traditional left-hand tactics to ultimately determine the outcome of the battle. But this time the Spartan warriors actually The concentration on the left was indeed unexpected.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He thought for a while and said: "Is it because of the failure of the Battle of Leuctra? Well, the Spartans thought that their traditional tactics were no longer applicable, so they changed their formation? Or... they just put up a random formation. , pretending to fight with us, just to slow down our rescue of Tegea?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors knew the current situation of Sparta, and they could only command and command such a large army. The old king Agesilaus had learned about this veteran's past battles. His style was cunning and changeable, which was very different from the traditional Spartan generals. This change in battle formation that was different from the past would certainly attract his attention. But for a while, he couldn't guess the other party's true intention, and temporarily suppressed the doubts in his heart, and said: "Your Highness, you are right, we should rescue Tygea first now!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But when the Theonia army approached Tygea, At that time, the Spartan army had all stopped attacking the city and continued to line up east of the Theonian army. It seemed that they were really preparing to fight to the death with the Theonian army here.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax immediately called together the commanders of the legions and told them the battle plan that he had discussed with Printors.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Highness, our First Legion has the strongest combat effectiveness, but you have placed us on the left wing and the Fourth Legion on the right wing to fight against the Spartans. I think this seems a bit unreasonable!" Ctissus objected.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I think it's very reasonable! The Fourth Army is fully capable of repelling the Spartans on the front and winning the entire battle!" Olivers not only retorted loudly, but also showed his seniority: "Ctissus, look Why don't you come out? You just became the commander of the legion and you don't take us seriously."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Sir Olivers, how dare I do that." Ctissus responded while complaining and unwilling to be outdone: "I'm just doing this for you. For the sake of victory, I'm just telling a fact."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing this, Crotokatax hurriedly stepped forward to persuade: "You two, stop fighting! I believe that the combat power of the Fourth Army can completely resist or even repel Spar. Master's attack, but the key to victory in the entire battle lies on our left wing!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Commander of the Ctissus Army, you must lead the first army to defeat the enemy in front of you as soon as possible, and then attack the flanks of the enemy's center to win the entire battle. I hope you can do it!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ctissus was refreshed and immediately said confidently: "Your Highness, please rest assured that the First Legion has never disappointed the commander!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The conflict seemed to be resolved, but then Tiger, the commander of the Seventh Legion, Delos said dissatisfied: "Your Highness, you are too unfair to the Seventh Legion! Those who are left behind in Messenia are the soldiers of my Seventh Legion! Those who are left behind in the new camp are the soldiers of my Seventh Legion! It will be carried out now. For the battle, we are still the soldiers of the Seventh Legion as the reserve force! Could it be that the Seventh Legion worked so hard to accompany you to the Peloponnese Peninsula, but failed to win a single battle? How will they face their relatives after they return? !"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The more he spoke, the more aggrieved Tegtilos felt, and his voice became louder and louder, causing the surrounding soldiers to look over.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Compared with the Seventh Legion, the other legions have benefited after all. The legion commanders quickly looked at their noses and noses, looking like they had nothing to do with me.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Crotocatacus was contradicted in this way, he was not angry. Instead, he persuaded him very apologetically: "The commander of the Tagetilus army, the commander of the Spartan army is King Agesilaus. He has always been good at Using troops, it may not be easy to win this battle, so by using the Seventh Army as a reserve team, I hope you can influence the entire battle at the critical moment and win for us! Even if we defeat Sparta, we will still be in Greece. The war will not end here. In future military operations, I guarantee you that the Seventh Legion will be the first one to be considered!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing these words, Tegtilos looked slightly brightened and immediately said: The Seventh Legion will Perform the responsibilities of the reserve team well.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tegtilos looks big and rough, but he is actually very thoughtful. Before leaving Thurii, Davos talked to him specifically. He felt that King Davos had a strong interest in Clotokatak. With Si's ardent expectations, how could he not carry out the order at the risk of offending the king? He was just taking the opportunity to act wildly, attracting the prince's attention, and earning more benefits for the Seventh Army. After all, it was the same as the first, fourth, and fourth legions. Compared with the Sixth Army, the Seventh Army really has no advantage.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Time is pressing. Please rush back to your own army immediately after accepting the mission.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing the legion commanders riding away, Printors, who had been silent before, sincerely praised: "Well done, Your Highness!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mukru, who was on the sidelines, understood why Printors said this. As the commander of the Theonian army, facing the doubts of his subordinates, he can solve them with just one sentence - this is an order! After all, according to " According to the "Theonian Military Law", after an order is issued, junior officers must strictly implement it. However, Clotokatax was still patiently persuading these generals at this time, which shows that the statement that "His Royal Highness is a humble man" is indeed not False words.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Under the orders of the commanders of each legion and the command of team officers at all levels, all soldiers of the Theonian army took action quickly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the Theonian army started to line up later than the Spartan army, half an hour later the Theonian army's formation was basically completed: the first legion was on the left, the sixth legion was in the middle, and the sixth legion was in the middle. The four legions are on the right wing. The thickness of the array is 15 columns and the length is about 4 miles. The first cavalry legion is evenly divided into 1,000 cavalry each and is located at both ends of the array.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus, who was standing in front of the queue and observing the formation of the Theonian army, saw that his opponent was moving quickly and quickly stopped making noise. He frowned and looked back at the somewhat chaotic array on both sides behind him. He couldn't help but said: "Hurry up and urge the generals to speed up the formation!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Father." Archidamus hesitated: "Didn't you ask them to deliberately slow down the formation?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I think even if they are There is no need to deliberately slow down, it is the Theonians who formed the formation first." Agesilaus said helplessly: "Hurry up and inform us, in case the Theonians suddenly attack, our formation is still so chaotic. , how to fight!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, father!" Archidamus quickly ran back to the formation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus looked at the Theonian military formation again. His vision was black. After looking at it for a long time, he could not tell where the advantage of the Theonian military formation was. Instead, he felt sour in his eyes. He was helpless. He gave up observing the enemy formation, held a walking stick in hand, and slowly walked back to the rear of the military formation under the protection of the guards.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The sun has begun to shift towards the western sky, and the warm sunshine shines on the Tegea plain. On the east side is the dazzling four-mile-long Spartan military formation, while on the west side is as dark as ink. , the Theonian army formation is also four miles long. The two armies are three miles apart and are surrounded by green wheat fields. They are like two yellow and black parallel lines drawn on a piece of green cloth, and between these two parallel lines The midpoint of the northern end of the line is the city of Tegea.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Father, the formation has been drawn up, why haven't you launched an attack?!" Archidamus hurried over and asked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Don't be anxious, wait a moment." Agesilaus glanced at him and said calmly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What are you waiting for? The soldiers have been waiting for half an hour. If you wait any longer, the sun will set!" Archidamus urged anxiously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus immediately darkened his face and said in a stern tone: "You should stay with your soldiers instead of coming here to mess around. Go back quickly!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus looked at Archida. As James left, he subconsciously rubbed his face with his hands. In fact, he was not waiting, but fearful.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   How can a veteran who has been on the battlefield for decades be afraid?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But that's what it is.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Agesilaus has experienced countless wars, this is the first time he has commanded a battle that can determine the life and death of Sparta, and his opponent is still the powerful Theonia. He has just witnessed the well-trained soldiers of the other party. , although he had made careful arrangements for this battle in advance, but when the battle came, he felt inexplicably guilty. The life and death of Sparta depended on his order, and he could not open his mouth with difficulty.
