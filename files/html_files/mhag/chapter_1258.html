 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Okay, two of you, please suspend the discussion." Davos said solemnly: "I assure you that Theonia will do its best to solve the problem of Argos Plains Regarding the issue of conflict, any individual or city-state that obstructs and wants to undermine the peaceful settlement process will be severely punished!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos paused and continued: "Now is not the time to discuss political affairs. Let's continue to watch the opening of the sports meeting. Look, the third athlete delegation has already entered the stadium!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Plato and Xenophon looked at each other calmly, said nothing, and both turned their attention to the field.

   Although they were both students of Socrates and citizens of Athens, and they had both written articles about Socrates, commemorating and promoting some of Socrates' thoughts and ideas, the relationship between them was still there during their studies in Athens. Yes, but with their different experiences, the thoughts they formed and the concepts they pursued have become very different. Coupled with the fact that they haven't seen each other for decades, the two sides are now quite alienated.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, Davos felt a little regretful in his heart: it seemed that he shouldn't have invited them at the same time.

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The wooden sign held high by the third athlete delegation clearly read "Sacred Kingdom of Theonia—Africa" Region", some viewers who come from northern Italy and rarely go out may be confused: When did the Kingdom add another region?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, this area was only established last year.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There are many Phoenician city-states along the coast of Africa. They were originally established as transfer stations by the Eastern Phoenicians when they were developing commercial resources in the Western Mediterranean. Their original intention was not to colonize. Until the rise of Carthage, these The transfer station gradually developed into a town, but due to its original economic base, it was extremely dependent on the support of Carthage.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But after Theonia defeated Carthage and took away several of Carthage's important commercial resources, most of the Phoenician city-states in Africa had to turn to Theonia, which had a stronger national power and a broader market. Asia Holy Kingdom.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As time went by, the trade links between Phoenicia and Theonia became closer, and with the prosperity of the former Phoenician city-state Hadrumentum, which was already a Theonia town, as an example, sporadic trade began The Phoenician city-state requested to join the Holy Kingdom of Theonia.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the Greek War ended, Theonia's strength was even more prosperous. People with a discerning eye even believed that it was not a big problem for Theonia to dominate the entire Mediterranean. Under such circumstances, except for Phenicia, Utica, etc. In addition to several large city-states that were still reluctantly persisting, other Phoenician city-states on the continent of Africa successively requested to join Theonia.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, under the instructions of Davos, the Holy Kingdom of Theonia added another region-the African region, temporarily centered on Hadrumentum.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   More than half of the athletes in the African delegation who appeared at the arena were Phoenicians. They had been famous for the Greek Games for a long time, but this was their first time to participate, so they were very novel and excited, and they were particularly active when marching on the track. .

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sophie Occleton of Carthage attended the opening ceremony. Sitting in the VIP seat, he felt extremely complicated when he saw this scene in the venue: Ever since Carthage became a subsidiary of Theonia, After that, its trade not only did not decline, but became more prosperous. After all, Theonia provided it with a broader market, but Carthage's agriculture was shrinking sharply. One of the important reasons for this is that Carthage lost the inland land of Numbia that it originally occupied, and Theonia was able to provide it with sufficient and reasonably priced food, which made most Carthage people invest in In commercial activities, it is no longer possible for Carthage to survive independently from Theonia.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Influenced by nearby towns, in recent years, people in Carthage have also called for "to be fully integrated into the Holy Kingdom of Theonia like other Phoenician city-states." The Senate and the Court of Hundreds headed by him have already reached a tacit agreement , did not respond to this.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But this kind of pressure has always been there, and he doesn't know how long Carthage can hold on to its independence...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The fourth person to enter was the Sacred Kingdom of Theonia - the athletes' delegation from the Po River region.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Theonia conquered Intramountain Gaul, it classified the entire area occupied by Intramountain Gaul as the Po River area. It can be said that this is the most fertile and vast plain in the Holy Kingdom of Theonia, but it is also the most One of the most difficult areas to stabilize.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It took Theonia nearly 10 years and exhausted various methods to gradually allow the Gauls to accept the rule of Theonia. Among them, Capps, the administrator of the Po River region, played the most important role.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the Theonian army conquered Alpine Gaul, Capus was transferred to the Po River region by King Davos and has been in office for nearly 10 years. He has worked hard for the stability of the Po River region and the integration of the Alpine Gauls into the kingdom. Now he Sitting in the VIP seat, I stared at the Po River region delegation in the venue with eyes filled with joy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since Theonia has only begun to immigrate to the Po River area in recent years, the proportion of Greeks in the area is still very small, so the vast majority of the delegation are Gauls. They are tall, with messy hair, and some have slender faces. They were covered in oil paint, and some were even bare-chested... Facing the audience, they roared from time to time and made gestures to show off their muscles.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the eyes of some Greek VIPs, this was a barbaric and untamed performance, but in the eyes of the Theonian audience who were accustomed to fierce rugby matches, this was a personalized performance, so the cheers became even more enthusiastic.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The main events for athletes in the Po River region are horse racing and racing, and the next delegation to appear is likely to be their competitors, because the athletes come from Bruti, a famous livestock area in the Kingdom of Theonia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the Bruti delegation, the Campania League delegation entered.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Today's Campania Alliance only has Naples and several neighboring sub-state towns left. Other city-states in the original alliance have successively joined the Kingdom of Theonia. Naples' current situation is somewhat similar to Carthage. resemblance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The next delegation to enter is the Holy Kingdom of Theonia - the eastern plain of Campania. This delegation is the strongest mixed group of Greeks, Etruscans, and Samnites. The winning event was the javelin, and of course they had to compete with the Samnite delegation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Next came the Corinthian delegation.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But when he appeared on the field, the vast majority of the audience were stunned, because there were only two players behind the boy holding the placard. Compared with the delegations in front of them, which ranged from a dozen people to nearly a hundred people, The difference is too great.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Corinth is only a city-state compared with the previous regions and alliances, it is the venue for the Corinth Games. Domestic citizens advocate sports and have strong strength in traditional competitions. Therefore, Theonia's invitation to Corinth The letter gave a lot of entries.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It seems that the Corinthians still have strong opinions on Theonia's hosting of sports games. I think if it weren't for your strong national power in Theonia and the leader of the Greek League, the Corinthians would probably not send even a single player." Xenophon commented with some gloating.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos smiled slightly and said confidently: "If the Corinthians do not participate, it will have no impact on this game, but it will be the biggest loss for Corinth and Corinthian athletes! Because the Theonian Games will surely become the most grand event in the Mediterranean. The celebration will also become a grand theater for various city-states, regions and athletes to show themselves to various countries in the Mediterranean! Are you right?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xenophon and Plato looked around at thousands of spectators from various places and races, As well as the athletes on the field who also came from various places and races, they all fell into deep thought.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The polite Theonian audience still cheered for the two Corinthian athletes, but the cheers were also mixed with a lot of laughter.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Corinthian general Cleonian, who was sitting in the VIP seat, was so ashamed that he wanted to find a crack in the ground and crawl into it.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Corinth not only sent out only two athletes in a perfunctory manner, but also arrived late on purpose. As a result, after they learned that other city-states had sent many athletes, it was too late to notify Corinth to make changes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, the Corinthian general still clearly remembered that the Corinthian MP who was originally stationed in the Hellenic League Parliament in Thurii learned of the news and scolded the Corinthian Council in front of him for being short-sighted fools, which would surely lead to the Corinthian Council. All the efforts made over the past few years have been in vain.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What efforts did Collins make?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the Greek war, the Corinthians saw Theonia supporting Thebes to unite Boeocia, Mandinia to establish the Arcadian Alliance, Ellis to unite the northwestern Peloponnese, and Argos to unite Persia. The northeastern corner of Loponnese, so it also asked Theonia to "unify the Isthmus of Corinth".
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos reluctantly agreed, but asked Thebes to negotiate with Megara.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There were only two city-states in the entire isthmus, Corinth in the south and Megara in the north-central part.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Megara is weaker than Corinth, it is also a city-state with a long history and a good reputation in Greece. Of course, it does not want to be unified by Corinth.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since both city-states surrendered to Theonia in time during the Corinthian War, Theonia did not favor anyone, and the matter was shelved.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But Collins still didn't give up.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Corinthians, who were good at doing business, were indeed more flexible than the Argives. When Megara firmly opposed being unified by Corinth, the Corinthians quickly changed their plans and proposed "to form an alliance with the Megara people on an equal footing." Isthmian League".
