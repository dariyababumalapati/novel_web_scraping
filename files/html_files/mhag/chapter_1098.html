   Chapter 1098: Selection of Regional Chief Executive (2)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But no elder dared to look down upon him. In fact, even if Vespa didn't say much, standing there was a strong support for Damabas, because he was a Lucanian One of the leaders of the faction, and Damabas was a Lucanian. Vespa's speech represented his support for him from the Lucarian faction in the Senate.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The influence of the Lucanian faction in the Senate is also very important. Vespa's son Bagule and son-in-law Asistes alone are very senior senators and important ministers of the kingdom. Now they have all been taken first. Appointed as District Administrator.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The other leader, Hermon, is not only the rotating chairman, but also has many daughters. He is also married to many senators and has considerable influence in the Senate.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, since the Lucanians have fought with the mercenaries led by Davos for a long time, their development in the kingdom's military cannot be underestimated. In addition to the outstanding veteran Lizaro, there are also many Lucanians in the army. Yaren serves as a mid-to-high-level team officer...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two powerful senatorial factions collided in the first round of selection, which did not completely scare away the other senators. The third recommender stood up. He was an agricultural officer. Minister Burcos, fearless of the dissatisfied looks of Stromboli and Vespa, said calmly: "Everyone, I would like to recommend that the candidate to be the chief executive of Corsica is Michippus! For I think everyone is familiar with him. Since the establishment of Theonia, he has been working in Turiyi. He has served as village chief, agricultural adjutant, person in charge of Turiyi copper mine, and Demo administrator. Sir, the chief executive of Bithynia, the chief executive of Heraclea...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He has rich administrative experience and rich experience in managing metal mines. As for experience in managing foreign races, which town in the kingdom is not multi-ethnic? , every official will face such a problem. The kingdom has long had a complete set of mature governance experience, especially those like Miksippus who have long been in direct contact with various races in government affairs, and have long been accustomed to it. As for
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   getting along with allies Experience, this is not a big problem. The kingdom is already so powerful, and most of our allies have become our vassals, especially the Etruscans. They are now extremely dependent on us, so how can they easily abandon us... In summary, , I think Miksippus is the most suitable candidate for the chief executive of Corsica!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Burkos's words were very direct, but the senators looked at each other: What's going on?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The first election encountered a collision between the three major factions since the establishment of the Theonia Senate!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Turii faction is also one of the most important factions in the Theonian Senate. It once overwhelmed other factions and dominated the affairs of the Senate. However, the Polyxis incident severely damaged it, leading to the entry of many influential senators. Prisons, such as Anilus, Masissachus, Orifes... Coupled with the death of the influential Cunogorata, Burx and Ansitanus due to their character and ability , none of them took up the responsibility of leading the Turiyi faction, which led to its decline in the past few years.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But after all, Thurii is the central town of the Kingdom of Theonia, with many talents. In recent years, Thurii officials with outstanding political achievements and sufficient qualifications have entered the Senate, and it has a tendency to revive.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The three standing senators are located in the first and second rows, one on the left, one on the right, and one in the middle, forming an approximate isosceles triangle, respectively representing the three major factions of the Senate. At the beginning of the establishment of Theonia, they It has been promoting the rapid development of the kingdom, which also made other elders sigh and be wary: Look at the resumes of these three candidates, their experiences are very similar, they are all in their 40s, and they all served as legionaries when they were young. A soldier who has made military exploits and retired from active service due to injury.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Precisely because of their performance during their service, they were successfully elected as the village chiefs of their villages. Due to their outstanding performance, they attracted the attention of important figures in their factions, and were subsequently cared for.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For example, during the Western Mediterranean War, Stromboli was urgently appointed as the administrator of Salos. He made some demands to the Senate and only agreed to take office after they were met. One of them was to transfer the administrator of Castellon who had just taken office. Phlocrates, who had been governor for one year, served as his deputy and assisted in governing Saros.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It didn't take long for Flocrates to be recommended as the administrator of St. Ibinia (although at that time, the level of the administrator of the town of Theonia was not clearly divided into high and low levels, Castellon as Thurii A town under the region, many elders believe that its chief executive position is only higher than that of the chief executive of Demo. As a famous financial smelting center in the Western Mediterranean, Saint Ibinia became its chief executive. The importance is much higher).
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And Damabas was able to become the person in charge of the Lucania Iron Mine and the administrator of Poseidonia, thanks to the great efforts of Wisba and Bagule.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Similarly, Miksippus's ability to become an official of the Ministry of Agriculture and manage the copper mines naturally has a lot to do with Burkos (minerals are also under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture)...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although he received a lot of care along the way in politics, However, their political experience in Theonia is about 20 years, which even far exceeds the time when many senators joined the Kingdom of Theonia, which makes them feel ashamed. However, such a young but rich political achievement in the Senate There are several other factions among these three major factions. Although this is because these three major factions were participants when Theonia was established and have the advantage of time, it also makes other elders feel the pressure of competition.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But now, due to the good political resumes of the three people, the elders could not find any obvious place to find fault, so they simply rectified the flaws and wanted to see the excitement caused by the collision of the three major factions.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But just when the ceremonial officer announced that he was going to run for election, Stromboli looked at Vespa, then turned to look at Hermon. He blinked and suddenly said: "I'm sorry, I choose to abstain!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " There was a commotion inside, and many senators were shocked: This Stromboli, despite his age, has a stubborn temper and will never give up easily when arguing with others. Why did he back down before the battle started today?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Weisba and Hermon also seemed a little surprised.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The etiquette officer frowned and said loudly: "Sir Stromboli, since you have proposed candidates before, your abstention will not count now. Does Lord Flocrates agree to abstain?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Flocrates came from the venue. Standing up from behind, he looked at Stromboli who was still standing. After the two made eye contact, he said loudly and simply: "I agree to abstain from voting to become the candidate for the chief executive of the Corsica region!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then , and then it will be up to Damabas and Miksippus..." Before the ceremonial official finished speaking, he heard Bulcos say: "I also abstain!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There was once again a commotion in the venue, but some elders saw it. clues, sneered and said nothing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This was the first time the etiquette officer encountered this situation. He looked back at Antaoris slightly nervously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Antaoris signaled him to stay calm, and then said loudly: "Are there any more senators to be elected?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Due to the withdrawal of Flocrates and Mychippus, a few senators saw the opportunity, and they held the hope of giving it a try. Attitude proposed candidates, so including Damabas, there were three more candidates.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Antaoris nodded to the ceremonial officer.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The ceremonial officer took a deep breath and said loudly: "The nominations are over and the election campaign begins! Please all the elders choose from these three candidates the chief executive of the Corsica region that you think is suitable!" The
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   five recorders immediately held up their writing papers. There was a wooden board with the names of the three candidates, each responsible for an area of ​​the venue. Starting from the back to the front, he asked each elder in a low voice about the candidate in their mind.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Some senators spoke loudly, while others did not speak and pointed to the names on the board.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The recorder used a white pen to draw horizontal lines under the selected names one by one.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Behind the record-keeper is a prosecutor, who is responsible for supervising whether the record-keeper is strictly enforcing the venue discipline and not cheating.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Senate elects town chief executives countless times every year. Everyone is already familiar with the process and the statistics are quickly completed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Antaoris did not tell the results immediately, but wanted to present the statistical results to Davos first.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos did not answer, and waved his hand: "I said, this time the selection of the regional chief executive is entirely up to you, and I will not interfere."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Antaoris expressed his understanding, holding the wooden board, facing the elders, and spoke loudly It read: "According to statistics, Damabas received 545 votes... So the final result of the election of Corsica regional chief executive was Damabas! Do you have any objections?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   No one at the meeting expressed objections, but Many people knew in their hearts that Damabas's ability to obtain such a high number of votes was closely related to the abstention of Stromboli and Burcos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After waiting for a while, Antaoris said loudly: "I announce that Damabas has become the chief executive of the Cosija region. Congratulations, Lord Damabas!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There was a burst of applause in the venue.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Damabas stood up with a face of joy and saluted around frequently.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a while, Antaoris stretched out his hand and pressed it down. The ceremonial officer immediately shouted loudly: "The meeting continues, please keep quiet!" "The
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   next step is to select the chief executive of the northern region of Sardinia. "As soon as Antaoris finished speaking, he saw a familiar figure standing up.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Stromboli coughed twice and said solemnly again: "I recommend Flocrates. The reason for the recommendation has been mentioned before."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There were a few chuckles in the venue, but they quickly resumed. Quiet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because in the northern region of Sardinia, in addition to Santa Ibinia, a metal smelting center, there is also a relatively wealthy and prosperous seaport town of Saros, and a small seaside town of Olbia that is also rich in precious metals.
