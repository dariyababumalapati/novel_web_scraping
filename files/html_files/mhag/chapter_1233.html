   Chapter 1233: The Establishment of the New Greek Alliance (1)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two former leaders of the powerful Greek states looked at each other for a moment, and sighed lonely at the same time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, they heard the voices of people around them: "Hey, let me tell you, I know that lame old man. He is Agesilaus, the king of Sparta. I went to Corinth to do business more than ten years ago. I saw him with my own eyes before!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I also know the person he was talking to, Callistratus, the chief general of Athens!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What's this! I also saw the military governor of the Boeotian Alliance before Ipamilonda! Why do you think the heads of these Greek city-states suddenly came to our Philae?!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You don't know yet?! We Theonia notified the heads of the Greek city-states to come to Larissa to participate in New Greece The official establishment ceremony of the alliance, and they came."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "We Theonia? Humph, Eucles, you traitor, Theonia is an invader, but you are willing to become their lackey!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   By Dai Wouldn't it be nice for Ogna to rule Thessaly? Taxes have been significantly reduced, port trade has been significantly enhanced, and our income has increased... Lackey! Humph, don't you also enjoy such benefits? You still have the nerve to say this Words! If you have the ability, leave Thessaly, which is ruled by Theonia!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I am a Philae, why should I leave!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I said Eucles, why should Theonia rule Thessaly? One good thing, you didn't mention it, the people in the south used to regard us as barbarians, but now with a word from Theonia, their noble generals have to come here obediently, I don't think anyone dares to look down on us in Thessaly People!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, even King Theonia is from Thessaly! Now those Peleus people are trembling. It is said that they want to raise funds to build a luxurious house for King Theonia's dead parents. Cemetery."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "No, even the Larissa people have become arrogant when talking to us. Who told Theonia to appoint the governor of Thessaly who turned out to be a Larissa, and he actually used selfish motives to The center of Thessaly was changed to Larissa!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "That one is not the governor of Thessaly but called the chief executive of Thessaly region."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I don't think there is any difference. It is not even much different from our Tagus. It's just that There is just one more king above. Alas, why are there no important ministers in the Kingdom of Theonia who are from our Philae? Otherwise, they can take more care of our Philae." ...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistra
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   before The quarrel between Tus and Agesilaus attracted curious onlookers and lively discussions among the people of Philae, completely regardless of the identity of the two men.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two of them did not dare to stay longer. Agesilaus, supported by his entourage, quickened their pace, and only breathed a sigh of relief when they entered the hotel.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The entourage went out to check in. Callistratus, who was resting aside, couldn't help but said: "I didn't expect Davos to be from Thessaly!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I already knew this. I led them from Persia back then. The returning Spartan general also proposed to the Council of Elders to invite Davos to serve for Sparta, but was rejected by the Council of Elders. It makes me regret it even thinking about it now!" Agesilaus said with a look on his face. upset.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Even if your Council of Elders agrees, I'm afraid Davos will refuse." Cabrias interjected.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Who knows, he was still young at that time..." Agesilaus still couldn't forget this.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "No wonder the Theonians were able to conquer Thessaly so quickly!" Callistratus said with a complicated expression: "It seems that this alliance ceremony was held in Larissa, and there were also Theonians to Thessaly. The purpose of the Salians to show their great strength."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "There is no doubt about this." Agesilaus sighed. Although he could no longer lead his army in battle, the strategic vision honed in decades of battlefield battles still existed. : "Thessaly has fertile plains, a large population, and powerful cavalry and light infantry. Jason had already scared us before. Now that it is controlled by Theonia, it is simply a huge stone pressing down on us. Above our heads, once there is any change in the city-states, Theonia does not even need to send troops from Italy. Thessaly's army can quickly go south, pass through Thermopylae, and enter the hinterland of Greece... Alas, Theonia's strength is getting stronger and stronger. It is becoming more and more powerful, and the Greek city-states have no possibility of resisting Theonia!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The three people fell into silence. In the end, Cablias couldn't help but whispered: "And Persia..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is a sensitive person Callistratus immediately changed the topic: "King Agesilaus..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus interrupted him: "I forgot to remind you just now that Sparta no longer has a king. Please call me by my name from now on."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus was startled, looked at each other with Callilias, and immediately asked with concern: "Agesilaus, can you tell me about Spar? What's the situation like now?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus was silent for a long time, and then slowly said: "I think you will know it won't be long before you know that the Spartans now are the same as you Athenians... Living hard..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He could tell these Athenians that after Dionysus conquered Sparta, he liberated the helots and made the helots and Piliases citizens of the new Sparta. Did you take away the land that should belong to the Spartans?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He was able to tell these Athenians that when the Greek coalition entered the Peloponnese and the main force of the Theonian army was defending in northern Messenia, the Spartan warriors attempted to rebel. If he had not tried his best to dissuade them, they would have been the same. The gathered Helots and Pileasian soldiers are engaged in a battle with a huge disparity in strength, and the result will be disastrous!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He was able to tell these Athenians how desperate the Spartans were when news of the defeat of the Greek coalition forces and the surrender of Athens reached Sparta. A few of them even chose to commit suicide, while he and Xenophon drank heavily. Drunk, can you hold your head and cry without stopping?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He could tell these Athenians that this time he received notice from the Theonians that the new Spartan government sent not only him as an envoy, but also a total of three Helot envoys and Pileasian envoys. He was ashamed. Did you, together with those two people, set out late on purpose to come to Philae?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ……
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   cannot!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ... Agesilaus has only one belief in his heart: as long as he is alive for one day, he will always silently shoulder the burden of the survival of the Spartans!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus and Cabrias felt an unspeakable heaviness in their hearts as they watched the old Agesilaus being helped up the stairs by his entourage...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The next day, after breakfast, the Athenian envoys and Agesilaus left the city and headed for Larissa.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the way they met many envoys from Greek city-states, including of course the Thebans whom they hated together.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Nowadays, these envoys no longer need to look at the former powerful states of Athens and Sparta. They have come together based on the interests of their respective city-states.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For example: the envoys from the city-state of Phocis were with the envoys from Locris, the envoys from Thebes were with the envoys from other Boeotian city-states, the envoys from Elis were with the envoys from the Achaean city-states, and the envoys from Mandinia were with them. The other two envoys of New Sparta and the envoys of Messenia were together (Although Messenia is now controlled by Theonia, Theonia still allowed Messenia to send troops to the United States out of consideration for the future. The Senian Parliament sent envoys to participate in this ceremony as an independent force). The envoys from Corinth, Argos and Megara were together. The envoys from Euboea and some Ionian city-states were together. Some Ionian envoys took the initiative to approach Callistratus and the others, and envoys from various Cretan city-states also took the initiative to approach Agesilaus...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   They were either happy, excited, or silent, Or worried, but the most fearful ones should be the envoys of the Arcadian Alliance. They first formed an alliance with Theonia, and then chose to betray. There are rumors that "Theonia hates betrayers the most and will give They punished them severely", so no envoys from other city-states were willing to get close to these unlucky people.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the envoys from various city-states gathered together in the east and west, a long queue was formed on the road leading to Larissa, which was undoubtedly quite eye-catching, and even attracted many tourists who witnessed this scene. The Salians spread the news that "Theonia ordered Greek city-states to come to Larissa for discussion."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The envoys also passed by the new military camp being built by Theonia and saw more than 20,000 Theonia troops training, and they were secretly alert in their hearts.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Athens surrendered, more than 100,000 Theonian troops and thousands of warships returned to the Western Mediterranean one after another, leaving only three legions stationed in Thessaly. One was to continue to stabilize the order in Thessaly and reinforce it. The second reason for Theonia's rule here is to prevent the invasion of surrounding indigenous forces.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, in the planning of the Ministry of Military Affairs, these regular legions will be replaced by the reorganized border legions in a few months. With the development of military training in Thessaly and the establishment of its own legion, Thessaly will have Adequate defensive capabilities.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The military camp that the Greek envoys saw was just one of the ones built by Theonian soldiers in Thessaly. After all, Thessaly is a vast area. Whether it is for military training or security defense needs, one military camp cannot meet the needs. requirements, so another military camp is also being built in the southern plain of Thessaly near the edge of the mountain ridge, so as to ensure that the southern towns such as Pharsalus and Achaia, as well as the citizens of Lamia south of the mountain ridge, can all arrive in time. to participate in military training, and the military camp originally established by Jason outside the city of Philae was in the northeast corner of Thessaly territory. The location was too remote and was abandoned.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The envoys entered the city of Larissa one after another, each conducting diplomatic mediation.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The people responsible for this alliance ceremony were the Theonian prince Clotokatax and the Thessaly region administrator Xiros. Both of them adopted a positive attitude, received them, and listened carefully to their opinions.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Note: Historically, the rebellion in Asia Minor was a major event in the late reign of Artaxerxes. The rebellion lasted for several years, greatly weakening the national power of Persia.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the rebellion occurred, the Persian army was attacking Egypt, which also caused Artaxerxes' plan to regain Egypt to fail.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At that time, in order to resist the attack of the Persian army, the Egyptian Pharaoh hired many Greek soldiers. Agesilaus, who had experienced the failure of the Battle of Leuctra, was in order to prepare funds and form an army to fight against Thebes, which had become powerful. In 2001, he accepted Egypt's invitation and became the main leader of the Greek mercenaries. However, because he was not reused, he instead supported the rebels in Egypt and drove away the original pharaoh.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Due to Egypt's internal struggle, Egypt's plan to counterattack Persia and support the Asia Minor rebellion was cancelled, which also gave Artaxerxes a buffer opportunity, and the Asia Minor rebellion was eventually put down.
