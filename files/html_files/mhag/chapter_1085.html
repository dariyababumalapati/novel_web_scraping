   Chapter 1085 The Mysterious Gorgion
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The people of Tarantum have always thought of themselves as great, as if they were nobler than anyone else. In fact, they have long been attached to the kingdoms of Leotini, Taunis, Potentia... these The kingdom's former allies have all been incorporated into the kingdom one after another, but it still maintains its identity as a free city... This time Prince Apox can overwhelm the Tarentum people in their most proud knowledge, which really makes us relieved. , It's a pity that I didn't see the scene with my own eyes!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Let's drink to the wise and wise Prince Apox!" Someone suggested loudly, and everyone responded immediately.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While everyone was drinking and celebrating, Maximus looked gloomy: King Davos's son has already become famous in the kingdom at such a young age, but his own children are still far away from being able to attend Tulii School. Alas, ...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Would you like another drink?" The cook's voice interrupted his daze. He turned his head and saw that the cook had already scooped up a spoonful of beer and stretched it out to his wooden cup.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He shook his head, but heard the cook say comfortingly: "This cup is free, I bought it for you. Just keep an eye on it, there will always be a way!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since moving to the outer city, Maximus went out to look for work every day. Every evening at dusk, I would come to this street tavern to have a beer. On the one hand, it was to relieve my depression, and on the other hand, I wanted to learn more about the news through these diners. After going back and forth, I gradually became familiar with everyone, and his situation was roughly the same. Be known by everyone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus took the wooden cup that was filled with wine again, hesitating whether to say "thank you", and then heard the cook say: "Since there is no chance at Thurii City Hall, you can actually consider going to other town halls." Halls, such as Cosenza, which is also a large city in the kingdom, is not too far from Turii. Perhaps because it is in the inland mountains and there are many residents in Bruti, many free people are unwilling to go there. I heard that the city hall there is short of employees. If you go there, you should be able to get hired more easily, and you might even get more opportunities to make meritorious deeds."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing this, Maximus felt something in his heart, and he hurriedly said sincerely "Thank you!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   the cook said with a sweet smile: "You're welcome. Actually, I can't control my mouth. If you really go to Cosenza, I will lose a good customer who can patronize my business every day. ."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I say if you can't let go of Aphra, you might as well marry Maximus!" A diner joked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The cook immediately widened his eyes, slammed the wooden spoon on the counter, and cursed: "I wonder if you, Neleus, drank too much wine and started talking nonsense again! Do you want me to find someone to pour cans on you? Cold water, sober up!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Neleus, you are a bitch. If you don't mess with Aphra every day and let her scold you a few times, you won't feel comfortable!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I don't think he is bitch, he is just a bitch. A spring cat."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What should I say?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's the season of heat!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Hahaha..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A group of people started making jokes, and the atmosphere in the tavern suddenly became lively.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, a diner with sharp eyes waved outside the tavern and shouted: "Gorgion, you are here!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Gorgeon strode into the tavern and nodded to the diners. When he saw Maximus, He hesitated for a moment and then said to the cook: "We still follow the old rules."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While the cook was preparing food and wine for him, someone already asked loudly: "Gorgion, is there any news today?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " Gion glanced at the diners who were crowding around, and then at Maximus who was lying next to him at the counter, and then said seriously: "There is indeed very important news today, especially for Maximus! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus, who was ready to listen attentively, was startled, and regardless of his reserve, he immediately asked: "What news is it?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "News came from the Senate this afternoon. There was a lot of talk some time ago about whether to send The issue of the legion going to the border to guard the border has finally come to an end." Gorgias said solemnly: "Military Minister Hieros submitted to the Senate a proposal to hire free people to form a border defense army and go to the northern border of Etruria and In order to defend the southern border of Illyria's proposal, Archibedes of the Ministry of Finance attended the Senate instead of Finance Minister Melses and also submitted a request for a further 6% direct tax to solve the problems of the newly formed army. "Military spending issue' proposal..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Do we really want to increase taxes?!" Many diners said in unison.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Only Neleus shouted in surprise: "Only a 6% tax increase, which is too little!" As
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   soon as he finished speaking, he was immediately reprimanded by others.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "In addition, the Minister of Household Registration, Laphias, also submitted a proposal." Gorgeon frowned, and the noise in the tavern forced him to increase his volume and continued: "He proposed to 'extend the free people to become Dio The number of years for citizens of Theonia has been extended from the original 5-6 years to more than 10 years. Only free people who are employed by the kingdom and become soldiers of the border army can become official citizens of Theonia after the expiration of the five-year service period.'
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   'In addition , if free people are willing to rent land in southern Iberia, they can successfully become official citizens after settling there for 7 years...'"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Gorgias said, and the noise in the tavern was heard. It gradually disappeared, and finally there was a strange silence, and everyone focused their attention on Gorgeon.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Gorgeon was still a little unaccustomed to this. He lowered his head and took a sip of beer, coughed a few times, then looked at everyone, and finally his eyes fell on Maximus: "Sir Laphias's proposal is very important to me." Your influence is not big, because according to what he said in the Senate, freedmen who had applied for registration before the proposal came into effect were still implemented according to the original "Immigration Act" method of converting to formal citizens in 5-6 years... So, Marcy Maximus is the most affected."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After saying this, Maximus's face suddenly turned pale.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Has this old bastard Laphias lost his mind? If he dares to make such a proposal, isn't he afraid of being resented by the free people of the entire kingdom?!" A diner immediately cursed angrily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What do people have to be afraid of? He lives in the inner city and is protected by many guards. It is difficult for us to enter and exit the inner city, let alone see him. Besides, he dares to make such a proposal to change the already existing situation. The "Immigration Act" that has been implemented for 20 years is impossible without the support of King Davos in advance, isn't it Gorgeon?" Another diner analyzed calmly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But Gorgeon did not respond to his question, but lowered his head and took another sip of wine.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Maximus... and all of us, don't be anxious. Whether it is the "Immigration Bill" or the "Taxation Bill", they have been in effect for almost 20 years, and they will not be passed so easily! As time goes by, The citizens of the kingdom have gathered to oppose, and these proposals may eventually be rejected by the Senate!" A diner said confidently.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   His words received responses from everyone, including the cook. Even Maximus felt refreshed and thought he saw hope.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Gorgeon sighed and said: "In fact, these proposals have been approved... In the afternoon, all departments of Turiyi City Hall, especially the Inspection Department, had received an emergency notice. Officials are required to remain vigilant and pay close attention to the situation in Thurii City. During the period when the bill is announced, the stability of order in the city must be maintained!..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What?! Passed?! Such an important bill was actually passed so quickly. Just passed?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What are the senators doing?! Are they sleeping?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 ---
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   the diners roared angrily to vent their surprise and uneasiness.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The senators did not sleep. That's because His Majesty King Davos also proposed a bill. This bill will divide the kingdom's territory into more than a dozen regions and add regional administrative agencies. The highest position is the regional administrator. It is said that its The responsibilities are somewhat similar to those of the previous wartime governors. He can govern all the towns in his area and has considerable power... The elders must leave enough time to discuss this important proposal and also think about appointing the chief administrators of these areas. The candidate..." Gorgias had a strange look on his face when he explained: After staying in Thurii for so many years, this was the first time he heard that four people appeared in the Senate at the same time in one day. An important proposal related to the future development of the kingdom, this is definitely not a coincidence, but the masterpiece of the wise king!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Aren't the Immigration Act and the Taxation Act more important than this bill to establish the region?!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I see, these elders only care about whether they can become that...regional chief executive, they don't care about the interests of the people at all. !"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, that's right!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The quarrel in the tavern gave Maximus, who was already depressed, a splitting headache. He pushed the wine glass back to the cook and pushed away the diners who were blocking him. Staggering out of the tavern.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Maximus, are you okay?" Someone behind him shouted with concern.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus didn't respond at all, his feet seemed to be dragging heavy objects, and he staggered forward
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   in a daze... After walking for a while, he came to the building he rented, and he came back to his senses and looked at it. Pedestrians coming and going felt a sense of sadness in their hearts: I have made a huge sacrifice and have made up my mind to integrate my family into this new kingdom!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, since I took my family out of the camp and came to this huge city, everything has not been going well. And the news I heard today completely made all my previous plans for the future come to nothing. This is Jupiter's response to My punishment for betraying my compatriots?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Or is it because I don't fully believe in Hades, so he doesn't protect me at all?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although he lived a hard life in the slave camp during those years, he kept working hard because he had the goal of gaining freedom as soon as possible. But now when he is standing freely in this bustling city, he feels unprecedentedly confused. : Where should we go in the future?!
