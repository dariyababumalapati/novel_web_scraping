  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Calistratus, calm down!" Cablias shouted seriously: "Look at the Theonian warships there, their number Far more than us, and its combat effectiveness is also very strong. I led the fleet to attempt a sneak attack on Lagnia Bay before and failed. If I rashly lead the fleet to break through the blockade, I will only be surrounded by them, and I will be surrounded by them. Many warships have been lost, and by then we will have completely lost control of the Aegean Sea!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even if they really want to land, we have already been prepared. The only temporary Marathon Beach where the Theonians can land is A defensive camp has been built with thousands of soldiers stationed there. Once any abnormal situation is discovered, thousands more soldiers can be deployed in the city, which can completely ensure the safety of the entire Attica." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Athens is well-defended, so of course I don't need to worry. I am worried that Theonia will attack other allies. If they are attacked by Theonia, the Greek coalition forces that are fighting against the Theonia army in the Peloponnese will inevitably be affected!" Callistra Tusi said anxiously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Cabrias said calmly: "Don't panic, first we have to determine whether the Theonians really want to land. Although the Theonian fleet has blocked Salon Bay, it is impossible for them to block it again. There are almost no coastal towns on the north coast of Attica, but we have many fishing villages on the north coast..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I immediately sent a messenger to notify the fishermen on the north coast and ask them to row their fishing boats and carefully explore whether there is anything abnormal in the Aegean Sea. !" Callistratus suddenly realized, turned around and ran away.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Cabrias turned his sights to the sea again, sighed, and felt a little ashamed in his heart: He had led the navy to defeat the Spartan fleet several times, and now he was indeed a little timid in the face of the powerful Theonian navy... …………………………………………………………………… 
      Shortly after the First Fleet blocked Saron Bay,

   3rd Fleet also bypassed Euboea Island on the northeast side of Attica. Arriving at Pagasa Bay.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The mountains on the northern border of Thessaly extend to the sea in the southeast, and then try their best to move closer to the mountains on the southern border of the sea, forming not only a natural breakwater, but also an approximately circular bay with an entrance of only about ten miles.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Perhaps because the mountains forming the breakwater were too high, the Thessalians did not build a water gate and lighthouse at the entrance. Instead, it was conducive to the Third Fleet's blockade here. This caused the merchant ships in the bay to hide in panic. Philae Port, and the Philae fleet even shrank in the port and did not dare to show up.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   About 20 minutes later, the Theonia troop transport fleet arrived, and the third fleet immediately sailed into the bay and arrived at Philae, the only port town in the bay, which made the people of Philae even more nervous.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was Jason's right-hand assistant Asidamas who was in charge of Philae at this time. After he learned the news of the "attack of the Theonian fleet", he did not panic too much and immediately ordered the defenders in the city to rush. Go to the port's breakwater for defense.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Philae's territory ranks among the last among the city-states in Thessaly, and its city area is even smaller. The reason why it is wealthy is that it has the only commercial port in Thessaly. The region is almost entirely surrounded by mountains and land trade with the outside world is extremely inconvenient. Philae has completely taken advantage of the convenience of maritime trade. The Philae people are naturally also very concerned about the security of the port.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Jason became the tyrant, he made great efforts to defend the port. He not only strengthened the breakwaters, raised the city walls on the ground, narrowed the water gate, but also added a military port in the port and formed a fleet... So despite wearing The Onian fleet arrived so suddenly that Asidamas had no fear that they would threaten the security of Philae's port.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But it didn't take long for him to receive a report from the scout: "A Theonian fleet appeared on the coast of Almiros, and many Theonian soldiers landed there!" The
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   coast of Almiros is east of Thessaly Why did the Thessalians prefer to build the city of Philae in such a small location in the north of the only low-lying land on the coast instead of building a seaport town in the larger Almiros?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because several rivers in Thessaly flow into the bay from here, the soil washed down by the rivers accumulates here over the years, forming a large swamp and tidal flat. If you want to completely fill it and drain it, and finally turn it into a suitable The land for human habitation and cultivation requires people's continuous efforts and advanced soil filling and drainage technology. The Thessalians were regarded as barbarians by the Greeks a few decades ago, and there is enough rich and fertile land in their territory. , so they had no urgent need to build a city here, and the original state of the Almiros coast has been preserved to this day.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Asidamas felt a bit panicked after receiving the news. Although he knew that the coast of Almiros was full of mud and difficult for people to travel, some of the situations he learned about the Kingdom of Theonia these days made him feel uneasy.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While he sent people to inform Polydorus, he led his guards on horseback and drove out of the city.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Standing on the mountains south of the city of Philae, Asidamas could clearly see the vast Almiros Depression: there were many ships docked on the coast, and even some Theonian warships. There were constant Theonian soldiers (mainly fleet infantry) disembarking from various ships and standing on the dark beach. If you didn't look carefully, you couldn't tell.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But there was a conspicuous yellow mark on the tidal flat that continued to extend and expand...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Asidamas looked carefully for a while, and his heartbeat suddenly accelerated: The Theonians were building roads on the tidal flat!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just as he was feeling very uneasy, Jason's brother Polydorus arrived, accompanied by another brother Polyphoron.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After carefully observing the situation in the Almiros depression, Polydorus, who was granted temporary military power in Thessaly by Jason, comforted Arcidamas: "Don't worry, our remaining army has entered Almirus." In the defensive camps in the mountains around Milos, all battle preparations were made. And with the speed of road construction by the Theonians, by the time they walked out of the tidal flats, the urgently mobilized citizen soldiers from various city-states in Thessaly had already arrived. , it is impossible for the Theonian army to break through our heavily guarded camp and enter the hinterland of Thessaly!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this point, he looked up at the sky, and then said with confidence: "If it comes to dusk, they will not retreat. , they will suffer countless mosquito bites at night. When we attack again tomorrow, maybe they will surrender!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Compared with Jason, Polydorus was more stable, so his words eliminated Asida Mas was uneasy, so he immediately said goodbye to the two of them and rushed back to Philae to calm the panicked people and stabilize order in the city.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Polydorus, why don't you let me lead the light shield soldiers to attack the Theonians and give them a powerful taste first!" Polyfulon asked loudly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Polydorus waved his hand and refused: "There's no need! Attacking now will only scare them away. We don't want to move anything. It will give the Theonians the illusion that Thessaly is indeed empty behind, and make them tired for a long time. After that, we will consider the issue of the raid."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Polifuron was rejected and felt a little angry. Looking at the leaving figure of his second brother, he couldn't help but spat and cursed in a low voice: "Coward!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What the Polydorus brothers didn't know was that the Thirteenth Theonian Legion and the fleet infantry that landed on the coast of Mildorus were just a feint attack and diversion. The army was left behind in Thessaly, and the real landing place was not here.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Half an hour later, the people of Peleus were horrified to see a huge Theonian fleet approaching the coast near the city.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The northeastern border of Thessaly is separated by a series of mountains connected by Olympus, Ossa, Pelion and other mountains. Among these unreachable mountains, there is a place that can be compared. Pass easily and smoothly enter the northern Macedonian territory. This is the valley pass formed by the Pinos River running through the mountains. The mud carried by the river over the years accumulates at the estuary north of the mountains, forming a small In the depression, the Thessalians built a small city called Peleus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since Peleus is outside the traditional territory of Thessaly and close to the territory of Macedonia, many Thessalian people actually do not regard it as a member of the Thessaly city-state. For its own safety, Peleus It also often leans towards Macedonia, so the city-states of Thessaly to the south of it are often alienated from it and are unwilling to interact with it. However, its own products are not rich, and port trade has never developed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It wasn't until Jason became Tagus that he was officially included in the Thessalian League. In order to promote the prosperity of Thessalian trade, Archidamas also dismantled the checkpoints south of the valley pass. Not only did Peleus Maritime trade has improved, and land trade has also developed. Therefore, the people of Peleus are full of gratitude to Jason and always respond positively to his call. Although Peleus is not a big city, Jason mobilized to form a fortress before. When Sally marched south, Peleus provided nearly 3,000 soldiers, which was almost all the young and middle-aged citizens of the entire city-state. Now seeing the Theonian soldiers rushing to the coast like a tide, they were frightened and regretted it. .

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Hurry! Hurry! Brothers, hurry up!..." Matonis, commander of the 2nd Army, who is over 50 years old, is still as heroic as he was back then. He was the first to land on the beach. He stood on a rock and roared like thunder, constantly urging his men. soldiers.
  </font>

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldiers of the Second Legion were inspired by the old officer. After jumping off the ship, they didn't bother to rest at all. Under the leadership of their respective captains, holding shields and spears, they stepped on the soft soil with one foot deep and one foot shallow, swarming as fast as swarms of swarms. Rush south.
