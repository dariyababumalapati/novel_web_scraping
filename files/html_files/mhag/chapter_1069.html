   Chapter 1069 Increase taxes? (continued)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Actually, for today's citizens of the kingdom, paying a little more tax will not have much impact on their lives." Antaoris spoke again immediately, how could he only let Sipulos be the most beautiful: " Just now I specifically asked Burcos and Finance Officer Archibides. Taking Thurii as an example, ordinary citizens here own at least 20 acres of land. The food harvested every year can not only meet their own needs, but can also be obtained through sales. About 300 to 700 drachmas (depending on the degree of harvest and changes in food prices), but this is not the bulk of their income. Since Thurii is the center of the kingdom, there are a large number of outsiders, and there is a strong demand for housing. Many citizens Just by collecting rent, he could earn one or two talents a year.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If we say that the citizens of Turii are special, let's take a look at Siculi, a small town in Sicily. The population there is less than 4,000. The main income of the citizens is farming. The grain harvested by each household every year, according to statistics from the Ministry of Finance, Converted into money, it is at least 600 drachmas, which does not include the cattle, sheep, horses, chickens, ducks, pigs and other livestock they raise. In addition, don't forget that they often go to the workshops to help part-time during their spare time, and can earn a lot of money.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So what do these citizens with a lot of wealth do in their daily lives? In addition to daily expenses and participating in military training, they also spent money to buy sports equipment and participate in various competitive trainings; spent money to watch games, and even bought a lot of 'Tino's Blessing'; drank a lot of wine and visited many restaurants. I have to take a dip in the hot spring bath occasionally, and the business of the women's branch is also very prosperous. Many citizens even buy female slaves as concubines...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So how much tax do citizens pay to the kingdom each year? "Antaoris opened his two palms and smiled contemptuously: "On average, I'm afraid it's less than 10 drachmas! Maybe some people are opposed to the tax increase. If the people are already poor and new taxes are imposed, they will not only be resentful, but may even riot. But the current situation in the kingdom is that the country is poor and the people are rich! Your Majesty and our officials have worked hard to maintain the operation of the kingdom, stingy with every expenditure from the treasury. Even some public buildings have to rely on public donations to build... If this situation continues, the kingdom will be unable to do so due to tight treasury. What benefits does it bring to citizens? !
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Over the past 20 years, in this favorable environment that the kingdom has worked hard to create and maintain, many citizens have transformed from impoverished refugees into wealthy and dignified citizens of Theonia. Now it is time for them to give back to the country! Even if the tax is increased by another 5%, it will only make the citizens pay less than 50 drachmas. It is still a small amount of money for them, but it is indeed a great help to the kingdom, you say right? ! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Well said!" Davos once again praised him, and once again glanced at the ministers with his profound eyes, he said loudly: "Everyone, do you have any objections to the issue of 'increasing taxes to form a new border army'? ?”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, I have no objection." Lysias saw that Davos had clearly expressed his support, and everyone looked moved and did not dare to stop him anymore, so they bowed in response.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I agree to increase taxes!” Hermon, Sedorum and other ministers also responded in the affirmative one after another.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Okay!" Davos slapped the armrest hard and said: "Now that we have reached an agreement, then Antaoris and Sipulos will take the lead, assisted by Alexis and Alkibiades, to formulate a detailed plan. In the tax increase bill, how much tax will be collected? How will it be collected? Where will it be used?... It must be written clearly in detail so that we can respond to the questions of the elders.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Here, I would like to solemnly remind everyone that before the two bills of 'establishing a border army and increasing taxes' are submitted to the Senate, everyone must keep it strictly confidential and must not disclose it to outsiders. If the information is leaked, I will find out who it is. I won't take it lightly if you reveal it! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   These last few words, Davos said them with such murderous intent that the ministers felt chills in their hearts, and they couldn't help but secretly remind themselves to be vigilant.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos retracted his stern gaze, softened his tone, and said: "Alexis, I have thought about it carefully. The number of soldiers recruited from foreign free people will not exceed two legions for the time being. After all, we have to consider the citizens." We should not let them think that we are preparing to use mercenaries to completely replace them and not allow them to serve and perform meritorious service."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After being reminded by Davos, Alexis suddenly realized what he had overlooked, and immediately responded with a heartfelt response: "I understand, Your Majesty."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, Davos's concerns go beyond this. Being familiar with the history of his past life, he was even more worried that these recruited free people who were not yet loyal to the kingdom would gradually become privately owned, thereby threatening the security of the royal family and the kingdom, so he must always remain vigilant.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then, Davos said: "Antaoris and Sipulos, when you are discussing how much to increase taxes, don't just use the two legions I just mentioned as the benchmark. You should set a higher level appropriately for the future." Leave enough room and try to get it all done at once, otherwise in the future when finances are tight again, taxes will have to be increased frequently, which will not only make the Senate sad, but also the people will be uneasy."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Your Majesty.” The two looked at each other and responded in unison.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos stood up from the wooden chair, straightened his body, looked at everyone, and said sonorously: "Everyone, I still say what I said, the kingdom is developing, the environment is changing, and old traditions and laws may not be applicable to this country. The new situation may become an obstacle. Therefore, as the elite of the kingdom, you manage all aspects of this kingdom. You must have flexible minds and sharp vision to discover problems in time and eliminate shortcomings in time. Only in this way can we ensure the long-term stability of our kingdom. Please keep this in mind if it continues to prosper!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos's sincere words caused everyone to think deeply.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What time is it now?” At this time, Davos felt a little sick in his stomach and asked Henipolis, the clerk beside the steps.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hennipolis glanced at the water clock in the corner of the palace: "It's already past noon."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Let the kitchen bring out all the lunches that have been prepared. We cannot continue the discussion when we are hungry.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "yes."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a while, the guards placed small dining tables in front of the ministers, and then the servants brought out large and exquisite pottery bowls, filled with steaming soup, with pieces of the same size floating on them. The beef soup contains a handful of evenly thin dough, as well as countless tiny powders of spices and herbs. The various aromas are mixed together, and the aroma is fragrant and makes people salivate.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is a new delicacy introduced by Christoya Restaurant in recent years. The flour is fermented and repeatedly kneaded with water to form a tough dough. Then it is cut into thin sheets with a knife and rolled out. Cook it in water, then pour it into the already cooked beef soup, add seasonings and enjoy it... Because it is easy to make, smooth and refreshing, and delicious, you can also add auxiliary materials at will according to the diners' preferences, such as some vegetables. , so it is very popular among the people of the kingdom.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the palace's kitchen is all run by chefs hired from Christoya's restaurant. Not only are their cooking skills extraordinary, but the raw materials they choose are naturally the best:
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The best quality wheat flour from Sikuli. Sikuli City is located at the foot of Mount Etna. The land area is small. Some Sikuli people have reclaimed some flat land on the mountainside in the past. It is very hard to work up and down the mountain every day. However, due to the accumulation of volcanic ash on the mountain, the land is extremely fertile and the cultivation The wheat grains that come out are full and taste very good after being ground into flour, and because the output is rare, it is expensive. Therefore, even if the Sikuli people join Theonia and regain new land, there are still very few people who are willing to do so. She worked tirelessly to farm on the mountainside, and most of the wheat she obtained was bought by Kristoya's restaurant to supply the royal family.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The one-year-old beef cattle produced in Lucalia from Grumentum are recognized by the people of the Kingdom of Theonia as the best among Lucalia cattle, because there is a village just south of the city of Grumentum. The big lake - Lake Patuxino, the water is extremely clear, and the lakeside is covered with grass. Grumentum's calves grew up drinking the lake water and eating the lakeside grass, so their meat is plump...

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone was already a little hungry after having a meeting for a long time, but the smell of the noodles immediately increased their appetite. Not only did they finish the noodles and drink the noodle soup, some people even asked for an extra bowl.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Every month, the palace must gather ministers to hold important administrative meetings at least three times, often during the day. Lunch is provided by the palace. The ministers have long been used to it, so naturally they are not so restrained during meals.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After everyone finished eating, they took a short rest, and the minister of construction, Heraclides, said: "Your Majesty, there is something wrong with the construction of the Enona-Rome road."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "what is the problem?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The Sidini people in the mountains north of Campania obstructed our construction. Not only did they fail to provide labor and food as agreed, but the road construction materials we transported there were often lost... This greatly delayed our construction process. .”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I remember that the Sidisini people also participated in the road construction agreement signed three years ago. Not only did they agree, but they also signed.” Lysias interjected.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Perhaps this mountain race felt that the highway passed through their territory, and more people traveling from north to south would affect the security of the territory, so they regretted it." Ansitanos said seriously: "Your Majesty, please allow me We will send diplomats to West Dissini to protest and demand that they abide by the agreement and help us complete the road construction as soon as possible.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "In the past, the Sidisini people were sandwiched between the two major forces of the Volscians and the Campanian League. They were conservative, xenophobic, and very tactful. Just using words to condemn them might not have an obvious effect." Diver Si pondered and said: "Alexis, your Ministry of Military Affairs notifies the Twelfth Army (the army's source range is in the plains of eastern Campania, and the military camp is built in Abella) to gather and go to the edge of the northern mountainous area of ​​​​Capua. Carry out military training and increase your momentum."

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "yes."
  </font>
 </font>
