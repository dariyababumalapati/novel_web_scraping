  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It was his own insistence. I am afraid he wanted to personally protect the few remaining Spartan citizens. Besides, I think that although he is old, his body is still relatively strong. If only If you are commanding the troops, it shouldn't be a big problem." Davos said seriously: "What's more, he has fought in Asia Minor for many years and is very familiar with the situation there. He can provide valuable reference for you to lead the coalition to attack the western part of Asia Minor at any time. , so I suggest you communicate with him as much as possible during the war."

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing this, Leoticides' dull expression changed again. He was silent for a while, and then asked: "Your Majesty, this book The book records all the soldiers, food and ships provided by the allies, but it does not say how many troops the kingdom is prepared to send?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos smiled and said considerately: "The Greek allies have sent a total of 30,000 troops. If you don't have any, Enough Kingdom troops are not conducive to your command of the battle, so I discussed with the Ministry of Military Affairs and decided to dispatch the 10th Legion, the 11th Legion, the 20th Legion (the Thessalian Legion), and the 6th Cavalry Legion ( composed of Thessalian cavalry), as well as allies such as Volscian, Hernici, Sabine, and Aqui in Central Greece are also willing to send troops. They have been allied with us for a long time, and they are also on the Italian peninsula, so our relationship is even stronger. They are so close that they can be counted as one of our own, and I will put the army they formed under your command... In this way, the number of troops provided by the kingdom has exceeded 30,000, and the total strength of the coalition forces has been more than 60,000. Such an army , are you satisfied?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides did not respond directly, but then asked: "Your Majesty, the navy?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "During the coalition landing in Asia Minor, the Fourth Fleet is temporarily under your command (the Fourth Fleet is mainly It was adapted from the Thessalian warships captured by Theonia, with a total of 100 warships. After Theonia annexed Thessaly, the Almiros wetland was drained and filled, and the Almiros military port was built. It became the station of the 4th Fleet), but it will then merge with other fleets to perform important tasks... In addition, more than a hundred Greek warships provided by the allies, mainly Athens, will also obey your command." Dai. Firth explained roughly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides's heart moved, and then he asked: "In addition to letting me lead the Greek coalition to attack Persia from Asia Minor, the kingdom should have other attack plans, right?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, you don't ask, I am also about to say , so that you can have a detailed understanding of the entire military plan to attack Persia formulated by the Ministry of Military Affairs, and be familiar with the entire upcoming battle situation, which will also help you make the right decision." Davos asked Henepolis to bring a map of the Eastern Mediterranean , then pointed at the map and explained seriously: "The kingdom has received the news. Since the Egyptian successor Pharaoh Jiehao died in a storm on the way to Thurii, the Egyptian general Nectanipos who received the news launched a rebellion. Tanipos, who was seriously ill in bed, was so angry that he fell into a coma. The city of Memphis fell into chaos. Maybe during the time I am talking to you, Nicotanibus has led his army to break through the city of Memphis.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to fulfill the covenant and punish the rebellion, I Chalcedis has been appointed as the reinforcement commander, and he has stepped up the assembly of several Sicilian legions to rush to Egypt as soon as possible to defeat the rebels and restore stability to the political situation in Egypt. At the same time, the Ministry of Military Affairs has notified the First and Second Fleets Complete mobilization as soon as possible, and then rush to station in the southern Gulf of the Peloponnese, where a wartime merger will be carried out. Sekerian will serve as the naval commander, looking for fighter planes to conduct a decisive naval battle with the Persian fleet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Ministry of Military Affairs will also conduct a wartime merger in the Peloponnese.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The other main armies in the kingdom's territory were mobilized, led by me personally, and then headed to the Eastern Mediterranean... The initial plan is to land in Egypt, but whether there will be changes by then depends on the development of the war situation... In the end, the three armies were in Persia We will meet in the Near East and march to the core hinterland of Persia to fight a decisive battle with the Persian army."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos said plainly, but Leoticides had already felt the magnificent war scene from his words, and he couldn't help but feel sad in his heart. It's a bit exciting: This is an unprecedented battle!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He tried his best to calm down his excitement and asked, "How long do you give these allies to gather their troops?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Two months, because they need to finish harvesting the farmland before they can go out to fight." Davos looked calm. Said: "Although it is a bit slow, from another perspective this is also a good thing. At least after the coalition forces land in Asia Minor, they can raise food on the spot and reduce their reliance on logistical supplies. Then they will arrive within 15 days Go to Philae in Thessaly to complete the final assembly of the coalition forces... This is my request to all the allies participating in the Persian war, and they have agreed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You can assemble the 10th and 11th legions first and arrive earlier. Larissa of Thessaly, prepare in advance for the attack on Asia Minor."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Having said this, Davos stood up, looked expectantly at this outstanding commander, and said solemnly: "The size of Persia Asia Minor is vast, and the terrain in Asia Minor is even more complicated. The Ministry of Military Affairs and I will not give specific instructions. After all, three years ago, you led some officers and staff to Asia Minor to support and observe the operations of the Persian rebel army. What is the situation there? I am more familiar with it. All military actions are decided by you. I believe you will do better than Agesilaus back then!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides perked up and immediately replied: "Your Majesty, please rest assured. , I will definitely complete the conquest of western Asia Minor as soon as possible and join the main force of the army led by you as soon as possible!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After sending Leoticides away, Davos said to Henepolis: "Go Chalcides ( Commander of the Eighth Army) call in."
  </font>

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Persia spent several years quelling the rebellion in Asia Minor, its national power was too exhausted and it was unable to do so. After conquering Egypt again, he had to withdraw his troops. This caused Artaxerxes' second military operation to attack Egypt to fail, causing his prestige to decline further.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to frighten his subjects, he followed the advice of Trebasus and vigorously liquidated the rebellion in Asia Minor. Many officials and local nobles in Asia Minor were implicated. They were punished in mild cases and beheaded in severe cases. A large amount of wealth and land were confiscated. They were then transferred to the nobles of eastern and central Persia who supported Artaxerxes, and many Persian noble officials centered on Susa were transferred to western Asia Minor and assigned important positions.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Artaxerxes's successive actions won praise from the Persian nobles. They no longer urged the Persian king to continue preparing for the war with Egypt, but spent all their energy fighting for this fat piece of meat in western Asia Minor.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Artaxerxes, who suffered setbacks in several personal expeditions, completely gave up his thoughts of obtaining military honors and decided to stay in Babylon with peace of mind and enjoy the rest of his life. Unexpectedly, the house leaked and it rained all night, and it didn't take long for the harem to come out again. question.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Artaxerxes was already old. He had begun looking for a successor for this huge empire a few years ago. He had many heirs, but he decided without hesitation to pass the throne to his eldest son Darius, just like his father. The throne was passed to him, and Darius was allowed to wear the crown symbolizing the king of Persia in public.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   According to Persian traditions and customs, heirs can ask parents to grant a favor in public. As long as it is within the scope of the parents' authority, they must agree and cannot refuse arbitrarily.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And Darius made a request to "give Aspasia."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Aspasia was once one of the most beloved concubines of Cyrus the Younger, and was later brought into the palace by Artaxerxes. Of course, he was reluctant to part with it, but due to customs, he perfunctorily declared that Aspasia was already a free woman. She could not be forced to go against her will, and if she was willing to obey Darius, he would be happy to accomplish it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   To his surprise, Aspasia chose Darius as his lifelong support in public. Artaxerxes could only follow the provisions of Persian law and hand her over to his son, but his heart was full of anger. .
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not long after, he took Aspasia away from Darius and sent her to the temple of the goddess Anatis in Icbatana, where she was dedicated to the gods and became a priestess. She had to observe strict laws for the rest of her life. of chastity.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Artaxerxes was very proud that he had punished the woman who betrayed him in such a gentle way and taught his son a lesson. However, he did not know that the heir to the kingdom was so angry that he began to plot a rebellion. Soon many people participated. During Darius's rebellion, just when he was about to put it into action, a eunuch who participated in the conspiracy reported it to Artaxerxes out of fear. The Persian king was furious and not only killed Darius with his own hands, but also And many Persian officials who were implicated were executed, and Babylon was filled with blood for a while.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A spy reported to the King of Persia: Darius seemed to have also sent people to lobby Tribasus, and he may also have participated in the rebellion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the intelligence department could not provide any conclusive evidence. The only reason that could be cited was that Trebasus and Darius were in the same situation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It turned out that Artaxerxes had promised to marry his daughter Amestris to Tribasus many years ago in order to win over his close advisors, just as he had married his other two daughters to Aurontas and Trebassus respectively. The son of Pharnabazus was the same, but the Persian king soon went back on his word because he himself married Amestris.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So he changed his promise and wanted to marry his youngest daughter Atosha to Tribasus.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But later he became obsessed with Atosha and couldn't help himself, and he never fulfilled his promise.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This incident made Trebassus a joke in the Persian royal court, but he himself had always behaved calmly and never complained. However, the intelligence department believed that he might still be dissatisfied, so Darius could not help but Go contact him.
