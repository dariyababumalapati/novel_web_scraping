  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   these Helot village chiefs were already grateful to Theonia for being freed. Now they can become the top leaders of this new city-state, and they are even more happy. Where can there be more? After much consideration, not only did they agree with all the suggestions from the compatriots from Theonia, but they also took the initiative to propose that the candidates for the general committee should be all compatriots from Theonia because they are well-informed and have more experience in governing the country. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, the people from Theonia would not be delayed. Five generals were quickly selected, and Tisias, the patriarch of the Kingdom of Theonia, became the chief.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ionicus watched all this, and although he saw a few clues, he did not dare to mess with it. He witnessed with his own eyes the extremely powerful military power of Theonia in both the navy and the army, and even its complete military Logistics made him realize the horror of this kingdom from the Western Mediterranean.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Unexpectedly, Tisias quickly found him and made it clear to him that as long as he was willing to join Messenia, he would have a seat in the council.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ionicus thought about it for a while and finally agreed. Although he had grown up in Elis, he had not had much influence in the Parliament and had never held an important position. The reason was known to everyone but not announced to the public. Mouth: Because he is a Messenian immigrant.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, he also put forward a condition: he hoped to bring several Messenian immigrants with good connections from Ellis to join the new city-state and become members of the council.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tisias agreed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ionicus immediately requested a fast ship from the 1st Fleet and hurried back to Ellis.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The laws promulgated by the new Messenian government headed by Tisias are being implemented in full swing: all helots in Messenia will not only be free, they will also become citizens of New Messenia, and The land will be allocated, and the councilors from Theonia will confirm and register the population and land of each village with the assistance of the village chiefs for subsequent distribution; in order to

 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   protect this hard-won freedom and independence, the new Messenian citizens must undergo strict training by Theonian soldiers in order to defend their city-state when the Spartan army attacks; when New Messenia is established, it must also have its own city, and the parliament will soon do so A decision was made to rebuild the city of Messenae, which would serve as the center of the new city-state. No other towns would be built besides this, so that the citizens could be more united.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In this way, it is the turn of the soldiers of the 1st Legion of Theonia to be busy. They will lead the new citizens of Messenia to expand the original Spartan military camp into a town;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   a Greek city-state also needs a protective god, The original patron god of the Messenians was Zeus, but Tisias and others easily persuaded the village chiefs to no longer believe in it, because the Messenians had failed in three previous wars, which showed that Zeus was not a god at all. Didn't bless them.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Out of gratitude and trust in Theonia, the citizens of New Messenia finally unanimously decided to ask Hades for blessing.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, the Parliament also decided to erect statues of Aristodemus and Aristomenes, the heroes who once led the people to resist Sparta, for sacrifice;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   the Parliament also decided to send out troops to various city-states in the Peloponnese Peninsula. Messengers, informing them of the independence of Messenia in order to gain their support, of course Sparta is not among them...

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The plains of Messenia are full of There was a joyful atmosphere, while the Spartan territory across Mount Taygetos was gloomy and gloomy.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The impact of the defeat at the Battle of Leuctra on the Spartans had not yet passed, and now a greater disaster suddenly struck - Messenia was taken away.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Messenia is extremely important to Sparta. Sixty percent of the entire city-state's agricultural output comes from there, and half of Sparta's citizens' land is also there. In addition, most of Sparta's labor force also comes from Messenia. ...With the loss of Messenia, Sparta's strength was at least reduced by half.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, upon hearing the news that it had been captured, the Spartans, who had always been vengeful, did not immediately organize their troops to attack Messenia as usual, because Sparta was already in a precarious state.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Previously, Sparta was determined to send troops to attack the Arcadian League led by Mandinia, but only a handful of Peloponnesian allies responded to the call. Therefore, until now, the coalition forces attacking the Arcadian League have not yet The formation was not completed, and there was still a big shortage of military food and supplies. In such a bad situation, how could Sparta still have the strength to confront the more powerful Theonian army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the Council of Elders, the inspectors and elders scolded Theonia for his treachery, but they were helpless about the difficulties facing Sparta.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus, who attended the meeting while ill, also got angry and scolded them for being short-sighted. Even though he knew that Theonia was already hostile to Sparta, he still refused to listen to his repeated dissuasion and ended the friendly agreement signed with it ahead of schedule. , as a result, Thebes took the opportunity to form an alliance with Theonia, which led to the threat of Davos to Sparta more than ten years ago coming true (Messenia was captured).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Some elders also retorted, pointing out: Agesilaus was also an active promoter of Sparta seeking support from Persia and ending the war with Thebes as soon as possible. Then it should be understood that if Sparta did not cooperate with Theo Niah's severing of diplomatic relations would definitely not gain the trust of the Persian king, and the Council of Elders had no choice but to make this decision.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Except for the censors, the elders were all elderly and would not waste their energy on meaningless insults and arguments for a long time. It didn't take long for everyone to regain their composure, and they intensely discussed how to solve the huge problems facing Sparta. threaten.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As the city-state in Greece that has the most dealings with Theonia, they know to some extent the strength of the kingdom on the Italian peninsula, and do not think that Sparta today can compete with it. They naturally turn their attention to Persia for help.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, Datis, the Persian envoy who was still in the city, was invited to the meeting place.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Datis felt nervous after learning the news that "Theonia sent troops to capture Messenia". Instead of being arrogant, Datis behaved very actively. After all, he came to Sparta with a mission, but now he has no The ability to realize Sparta's plan to unify the entire Greek city-states led to the Theonians' premature invasion of the Peloponnese, which was likely to ruin the Persian king's strategic vision, so he must work hard. Save.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Datis first comforted the Spartans not to be too nervous. A large amount of food baggage gifted by Persia and 50 talents of Dalik gold coins were on their way. Then he also promised that he would apply to the King of Persia and plead It can sponsor more gold and silver to Sparta, and at the same time allow Sparta to recruit soldiers in Asia Minor so that it can form a large army as soon as possible and repel the incoming Theonian army (Battle of Leuctra) The hegemony of Sparta was shaken, and coupled with the establishment of the Arcadian League, most Spartan allies no longer responded as actively to Sparta's call as before, so the Spartans had to go to Macedonia, Thraea Recruit soldiers from areas such as Sri Lanka, Ionia, and Asia Minor, and this obviously costs money).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The inspectors and elders calmed down a little, but soon they discovered the biggest problem: it takes time to recruit soldiers and form an army, and now the Theonian army is to the west of Taygetos Mountain and is available at any time. Possible invasion of Spartan territory.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus made a serious analysis of this: if the Theonian army wants to attack Sparta, it has three options.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   One is to take the middle route and cross the Taygetos Mountain, but the Taygetos Mountain is steep and the pass is controlled by our own side, making it difficult for the Theonian army to pass through; the other is to take the northern route through Arcadia region, invaded Sparta, but the city-states in the Arcadia region have never had contact with Theonia, and now that they have established an alliance, they may not easily allow a large foreign army to pass through their territory; The only option is to take the south route and let the army enter the Gulf of Laconia by boat and land on the coast of Sparta. According to the information obtained from the soldiers who had previously returned from Messenia's defeat, there were many Theonian transport ships and their troops landed quickly. Swift and violent, this route was the greatest threat to Sparta.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone thought that what Agesilaus said was reasonable. After some discussions, the Council of Elders finally made a decision: to temporarily cancel the military action against the Arcadian Alliance and send envoys to express goodwill; at the same time, urgently deal with The territory carried out military mobilization, strengthened the defense of the coast, and rushed to build facilities to prevent landings; young Pilianisi and helots in the territory were recruited to join the army...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   and for the helots, the Council of Elders also passed a special Resolution: Only helots who perform well in the war will be freed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus also requested the Persian envoy Datis: He hoped that Persia could send a fleet to help Sparta defend the Gulf of Laconia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Datis fully agreed and promised to convey Sparta's request to the King of Persia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, the Council of Elders also decided to send an envoy to Messenia. In addition to taking the opportunity to find out the next move of the Theonian army, more importantly, in the name of consultation, it delayed the Theonian attack as much as possible. , buying time for Sparta to build an army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This important meeting concerning the life and death of Sparta lasted until the afternoon. Agesilaus dragged his tired body back home and immediately summoned Xenophon, who had been waiting at the mansion, to tell him the contents of the previous meeting. I told him briefly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   That night, Xenophon felt very uneasy when he learned the news that "the Theonian army had landed on the coast of Ellis" at home. He rode to Sparta at dawn. Unfortunately, he lived far away from Sparta. By the time he arrived at Agesilaus's mansion, the Spartans had already received the news that "Theonia's huge fleet had invaded the Gulf of Messenia", but Sparta had not had time to send reinforcements. The Theonian army has already landed on the coast of Messenia.
