   Chapter 1230: Delphi Surrenders
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I promised those big shots to send you safely to Delos. Although I, Storus, always keep my word, please don't cause trouble for me, otherwise you will annoy me. I'll send you to the sea to feed the fish!" The boat owner said viciously while paddling.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I don't like people pointing fingers at me!" The man suddenly said sternly: "Tell you, I will never go back to lie in that smelly boat canopy again! If you are not happy, you can take me out now Push him into the sea."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The man spoke with a sense of majesty. The boat owner did not dare to make contact with his sharp eyes. He muttered a few words in a low voice and then immersed himself in paddling hard.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a while, he saw the man staring motionless at the coast, and couldn't restrain his curiosity and asked: "Hey, who are you? Why did Callistratus and Iphi Cratus...these generals came to the dock to see you off?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Because...I am their creditor!" The man said angrily, and then added something meaningful: "Also because I am Dio Nea's mortal enemy!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is indeed the case, because this man is Jason.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After he escaped into the city of Athens, the Athenian generals treated him with great courtesy, invited the best doctors to treat him, and even set aside a luxurious house for him to recuperate. However, they hoped that he would give him the command of the mercenaries. Temporarily handed over to the General's Executive Committee.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   People under the low eaves had to bow their heads. Jason, who was like a bereaved dog, could only agree. As a result, these nearly 8,000 mercenaries became the main force in resisting the attack of the Theonian army and suffered heavy losses.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Those were the elite troops that Jason spent many years of hard work and countless money to train, and they were very loyal to Jason.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But after Jason learned of the result, he did not complain at all. Instead, it made the top officials of Athens a little embarrassed. So when Athens decided to surrender to Theonia, Callistratus specifically talked to Jason. Talk, and made it clear that he is willing to take risks and help Jason escape from Athens, because once Athens surrenders to Theonia, the Theonia are likely to ask for Thessaly Tagus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Whether the Athenians wanted to cause some trouble for the Theonians out of guilt or unwillingness, Jason knew that he had no more choices.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, Jason stared blankly at the coast that was constantly being beaten by the waves, thinking that his life's hard work had been destroyed in one moment, and that he was even forced to stay away from his homeland. He felt extremely annoyed and regretful, and he couldn't help but want to go crazy.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He suddenly knelt down, grabbed the side of the boat with both hands, and put his head directly into the water...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The boat owner was startled, hurriedly threw down the oar, ran over and tried to pull him up, and kept shouting: "Get up quickly, Don't be stupid and don't jump into the sea!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Jason stood up suddenly with his hands on his hands. The cold water temporarily extinguished the anxiety in his heart. He wiped it hard on his head and face with his hands, and then wiped it away. The water in his hand was thrown towards the boat owner.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing the captain dodging in embarrassment, he laughed, then looked up at the rising sun, and said viciously: "Hurry up and row the boat, I want to rush to the east!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The surrender of Athens was like knocking down dominoes, making all the Greek city-states who were still waiting and watching no longer have any luck.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ellis, Phokis, Locris, the city-states of Arcadia, and the Ionian city-states that originally belonged to the Athenian Maritime Alliance... sent envoys one after another to the Theonian military camp in Attica to report to Clotokatax expressed goodwill and offered to join the New Hellenic League.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Under such a trend, the Achaean city-states, Euboea, and even Crete, which had remained neutral since the beginning of the war (Crete was forced by the Diolian 2nd Fleet, under the orders of the Ministry of War) Below, Midorades led the second fleet, sailing around Crete every day)... and also expressed their willingness to accept Theonia as the leader of the alliance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In this way, Delphi, which had been silent, became particularly eye-catching.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Many people speculate that Delphi, as the holy land of the entire Greek world, may have to fight to the end with Theonia, a heretic.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But in fact, the priests of Delphi were already in a panic because there were rumors that Theonia was preparing to send an army to destroy Delphi and steal all the gold and silver from the holy treasury.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, when they received a definite message: Prince Crotocatax of Theonia was coming to Delphi to visit under the protection of the army, all the priests and people of Delphi felt that a disaster was coming. Some packed their bags and prepared to flee to other places, while some had already made the determination to defend the Temple of Apollo at the risk of sacrificing their lives...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The eyes of the people of all the Greek city-states were focused on Crotocathax. , they are also worried.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the noble Theonian prince entered Delphi, although due to security issues, he violated Delphi tradition and led the palace guards up the mountain and into the temple, he did not fight with the priests. On the contrary, he continued With a pleasant appearance, he not only solemnly offered sacrifices to Apollo, but also offered to build a holy treasury in Delphi to store the gold and silver donated by Theonia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Delphic priests temporarily lowered their guard and began to negotiate with Crotokatax.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax made a promise to the priests: After Theonia serves as the leader of the New Greek Alliance, Delphi's status among the native Greek people will not change!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And the Sacred Kingdom of Theonia will not only protect Delphi's status as the "most sacred oracle" in the Greek world, but also make it the greatest oracle in the entire Sacred Kingdom of Theonia, and in the future Theonia will This promise will also be carried out in the lands conquered and controlled by Azor!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This big pie that suddenly fell from the sky made the Delphi priests ecstatic. You must know that since the rise of the Kingdom of Theonia, fewer and fewer city-states and people came to Delphi to worship and seek oracles. Nowadays, Delphi's sacred status among the Greek people is no longer what it used to be. This promise made by Theonia will not only allow Delphi to regain its former glory, but also allow Delphi to rely on Theonia's strong strength. Fei's influence extended beyond the Greek world to the vast Mediterranean.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just when the priests were overwhelmed with joy, Clotokatax made a request: But Delphi must recognize the contents of the "Hades Codex" promulgated by the main temple of Hades in Theonia. Recognize Hades as the head of the Greek gods and accept the jurisdiction of the main temple of Hades in name only.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The priests were stunned, but with the Theonian army sharpening their knives on the territory on one side and a more glorious and beautiful future on the other, Delphi had no more choices.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The priests accepted Clotocathac's request and quickly began to take action. They held a grand sacrificial ceremony. All the Delphians were asked to participate, and then Clotocathac Si asked the oracle from the temple of Apollo in front of everyone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The old Pythia danced for a long time in the oracle filled with the smell of sulfur, and almost fainted. After coming out, she announced in public that she saw the great Apollo driving a golden chariot, leaping out of the mountains to the west, and sitting in the chariot. Holding the black-haired Hades holding a double fork, he was chatting cordially with another young man wearing a crown, and the golden car rose to the sky and turned into an extremely dazzling white light, illuminating the entire earth and ocean...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone present immediately made their own interpretation of this oracle, and soon a version of the oracle that everyone agreed with gradually spread in mainland Greece: "The mountains to the west" refers to the Italian peninsula and Theonia. Kingdom, because Italy to the west of the Adriatic Sea is indeed a peninsula traversed from north to south by the towering Apennine Mountains, and the native Greek people often ridicule the Theonians as barbarians, and barbarians are often mountain races; "The Golden Car from "Italy Leap" means Apollo's recognition of the Kingdom of Theonia, not to mention that he is driving for Hades, which already implies that Apollo has changed his flag and is dominated by Hades; as for the other person in the car The young man is undoubtedly the King of Theonia, because it has long been widely spread in the Western Mediterranean that King Davos is a descendant of Hades, and Delphi publicly recognized this statement on behalf of mainland Greece; and in the end The scene is a metaphor that the Kingdom of Theonia will create unprecedented glory, and Hades and Apollo will also share the glory...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It can be said that the oracle made by Pythia was very thoughtful, But this oracle set off a spiritual storm in the minds of the native Greek people.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In contrast, what Delphi announced next made it easier for the people to accept: Delphi recognized the sacred name of the Kingdom of Theonia and it was an unquestionable Kingdom of Greece, and it would become an important part of the Holy Alliance. members and fully qualified to participate in the Pythian Games.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   No matter what, Delphi was saved, and it was a happy ending, and the Greek people breathed a sigh of relief.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, some city-states would be disappointed and annoyed, but to no avail.
  </font>
 </font>

   Crotokatax achieved a satisfactory result at Delphi. He did not take much rest, and then publicly declared that he would Visit Olympia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was the Olympian's turn to feel nervous.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Unlike Delphi, Olympia has never been an independent holy place. For hundreds of years, it has been switching hands back and forth between Elis and Pisa, and Argos, Sparta and Athens often pointed their fingers at it; It did not have the huge influence that Delphi had among the people, perhaps because the moody, lustful and lustful personality of Zeus, the god-king, did not appeal to the Greek people.
