   Chapter 1075 Gaining Freedom
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus did not refute or resist, allowing Gaius to catch him, but Gaius' fist did not hit him because the slaves around him hugged him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This small commotion in the square made the officials of the Slave Management Office who had not left look very unhappy. The slave manager Aikarus was even more angry and immediately asked the soldiers to arrest him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Gaius had his hands cut behind his back and pinned to the ground, he continued to curse. The foreman gave him a blow in the mouth, causing his teeth to fall out and blood to flow profusely. Half of his face suddenly became swollen, and then he said "Ooooooo..." " couldn't speak clearly, but still stared at Maximus fiercely.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus never dared to make eye contact with him and stood motionless. Even when Gaius was taken away, he did not raise his head.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The slaves were soon led by the foreman to the mine, and he was the only one left in the huge square.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, the leader of the slave camp, Aikarus, walked over, patted him on the shoulder, and said earnestly: "You did the right thing! Those stupid people can't see the situation clearly. The kingdom is so powerful, and their little What effect a small conspiracy can have is a joke!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus felt that his words were a bit harsh. He raised his head and asked: "Lord Aikarus, I am free now, can I do it now? Have you left here?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Of course, you are a free man now. However, you have stayed in the slave camp for so many years and have no understanding of the situation outside. If you suddenly leave here and live in a town in the kingdom, I'm afraid you will You are very uncomfortable. If you are not careful, you may violate the laws of the kingdom and affect your future development. It is better to stay in the camp and work as an employee here. After all, you are familiar with this place and you are well educated. You can also write Diorian script, and you can become a manager here. This will also help you become a Diorian citizen earlier. While working for the camp, you will slowly become familiar with the city of Thurii. , Familiar with our kingdom..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reason why Aikarus said this to retain Maximus was because after receiving the order from the Slave Management Office, he specially sent people to learn about the amnesty of Rome. When the slave learned that he had outstanding abilities, he began to cherish his talent and wanted to add a capable subordinate to his camp.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Thank you, Lord Aikalus, for your consideration. I will think about it carefully." Although Maximus admitted that what Aikarus said was reasonable, he did not want to stay in this place for a moment longer, so his words were a bit perfunctory. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ikarus also saw it. He still smiled, patted Maximus on the shoulder, and said: "Go back and think about it carefully. Even if you don't have this plan now, what I said will be effective within a year. By the way. , you can go to the camp management office to register now and receive your bronze medal for emancipation from slavery."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the amnesty concerning him was very popular this time, he completed the procedure quickly, and even he had Some of the rents were not paid, and the office staff waived them for him, and said: "This is a special notice from the Slave Management Office, thank the kind King Davos!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus finally got the one that all slaves dream of. Bronze Medal for Liberation from Slavery: This bronze medal is rectangular, only the size of an index finger, with the word "freedom" engraved in the middle, and a number on the top. The
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   bronze medal is very simple to make, and it seems easy to imitate, but in fact this bronze medal is just an identity The proof, shown to the inspection team during regular inspections, showed that what really mattered was that his name was deregistered at the Kingdom's Slave Management Office.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You must know that whether it is public or private, as long as you purchase or add a slave, you must register with the Kingdom Slave Management Office, record the slave's appearance and characteristics, give him a fixed number, and brand it on the slave of hips.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the one hand, the Slave Management Office will regularly check the living conditions of slaves every year according to the roster. If it is found that they may be abused and tortured, court personnel may come to the door; on the other hand, once the slave escapes, the Slave Management Office will The information about the escaped slave was provided to the inspectors in various towns, and they were arrested. Once caught, not only would the fate be miserable, but there would also be no chance of freedom forever.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Maximus's name was eliminated from the slave roll, it meant that he was already a free man.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus carefully placed the bronze medal against his chest and strode back to his home.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When his two children came out to greet him happily, the heavy guilt in his heart suddenly disappeared: I did nothing wrong, my children should not be trapped in this cage, they should be happy like other people's children. Studying in Theonia's school...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Maximus, you...you ran away from the mine! What should I do?! Go back! Go and admit your mistake to them..." Wife Fulvia was very panicked. She had misunderstood her husband appearing at home at this time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Fulvia, we are free!" Maximus hugged the child and said to her excitedly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What did you say?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I mean I have become a free man. This is the bronze medal I got for emancipation from slavery!" Maximus handed the bronze medal to his wife.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Fulvia looked at the bronze medal carefully and repeatedly several times, still unable to believe it: "Is this... real?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Of course it is real, we can leave here! Leave now!" Maxim Si said with determination.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Fulvia did not respond. She clutched the bronze medal tightly with one hand and lightly covered her face with the other. Hot tears flowed down her fingers...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Mom, why are you crying?" The two children tugged on Fulvia's clothes with concern.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus stepped forward, hugged his wife forcefully, and said in a deep voice: "Fulvia, from now on we are no longer slaves! The children will no longer be slaves! We will have A better life!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yeah!...Yeah!..." Fulvia choked and nodded repeatedly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus had not accumulated any valuable possessions in the slave camp in the past few years. The family quickly packed their packages and walked towards the camp gate.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing the heavily armed guards standing guard at the gate of the camp, Fulvia and the children subconsciously hid behind Maximus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But instead of stopping them, the guards congratulated Maximus. It seemed that the fact that "he was pardoned" had spread throughout the camp and became a celebrity in the slave camp.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After walking out of the camp, Maximus took a deep breath of fresh air. Before he could think about it, he saw someone walking towards him, and his heart suddenly sank.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Maximus, congratulations!" the man said loudly, with a smile on his face, completely different from the sinister and cruel look he had when he was questioned in the camp last time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus stepped forward and said, "Thank you for your help, sir!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It has nothing to do with me. This is entirely His Majesty's mercy!" The man said seriously, and then he asked: "Now you are free Man, what are your plans?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "First go to the Thuri household registration office to apply to become a Theonian citizen, and then find a job to earn money to support the family." Maximus didn't know what the other party meant by asking this, so Answer carefully.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This is indeed the most common way of survival for liberated slaves, but now the situation has changed." The man's mouth curled up slightly and he spat out a sentence.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus's heart was moved, and he was about to ask: "What has changed?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But he heard the man say: "Are you interested in coming to work with us? Our intelligence department is directly under the jurisdiction of His Majesty. Not only is the salary not low, but it is also easy to make meritorious deeds. , you will become a citizen of Theonia in a shorter time."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus does not know much about the political system of Theonia, but only from the literal meaning of "intelligence department" and the last personal experience , he could probably guess what they were doing, and he was very resistant psychologically. This once in his life was enough to break his heart, and he didn't want to experience it a second time. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I'm sorry, I just want to live an ordinary life." Maximus said calmly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The man seemed to expect that he would answer this way, and did not show any dissatisfaction. He shrugged and said, "Well, I hope everything goes well for you! This is our reward for you, and a little bit of my heart!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The man took it .
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He took out a heavy money bag and handed it over.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The word "reward" stung him, and he instinctively wanted to refuse.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Take it, you will soon know that life in Turiyi is not easy, and it is impossible without money." The man looked at the two children behind him and said seriously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   These words made Maximus hesitate, and then he felt his wife squeezing his arm: yes, in the past few years, he has spent all his hard-earned salary on the study of the Theonian language and characters. While studying, he didn't have much savings anymore...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He lowered his head, took the money bag, and whispered with some shame: "Thank you..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "If you change your mind one day, you can go to the outer city of Xicheng to inspect The white house next to me comes to me. If anyone stops you, say that Tratus asked you to come." Maximus
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   nodded, indicating that he heard it, but did not respond aloud, holding the two The child, his wife, and the package were walking toward the east.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Boss, forget it if he doesn't want to. Anyway, he is a bait. Even if he doesn't cooperate, as long as we keep an eye on him, we can continue to arrest those who want to avenge him and avenge Servius and the old Roman nobles. Complicity."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The number of Roman citizens in Thurii is increasing, and we now lack people who truly understand them and can gain their trust. What's more, I have checked Maximus's past, and his abilities are also very good." Latus looked at the retreating figures of the Maximus family with a playful smile on his face: "After he hits a wall, maybe we still have a chance."
