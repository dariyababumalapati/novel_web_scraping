   Chapter 1235 The Prosperous Port of Piraeus
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Why Athenian pottery is loved by the wealthy people of Theonia is not only because of the unique and high-quality black and red painted pottery, but also because of the exquisite pictures on the pottery.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Athens gathered many outstanding painters from the Greek world, and almost all of them were engaged in vase painting. Onesimus was the leader among them. He once won twice in the vase painting competition of the Panathenaic Society. Si spent a lot of money to hire him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Facing the compliments of Heskraus, Onesimus's performance was not much different from that of other Athenians: "I hope the Theonians can fully appreciate the beauty of my works! Ah...this batch of There are too many pottery. I am a little tired and need to rest for a while."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Looking at Onesimus who was pretending, stretching and yawning, Heskraus cursed in his heart, but agreed with his mouth: "Yes, Yes, you really should take a good rest... It seems that my order can only be postponed temporarily."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Why are there still orders?!" Onesimus said impatiently: "Wait until I have a rest. Let's talk about it later!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Then I can only reject this order with the buyer, because they want it urgently." Hesklaus said seemingly unintentionally: "It is said that the Theonia royal family ordered the goods personally. They want it. Place this batch of pottery in the palace and use it to entertain distinguished guests from all over the world during the sports games."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What did you say? The Theonian royal family wants the goods?!" Onesimus suddenly asked seriously .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, I can swear to Athena that it was the order placed by the royal family of Theonia!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Uh... I think I can wait until this batch of pottery is completed before resting." Onesimus immediately changed his words shamelessly.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Don't look at him looking down on the Theonians, but he knows very well that the Holy Kingdom of Theonia is the overlord of the entire Western Mediterranean and the Greek world, and how noble its royal family is. If his works can be owned by everyone, The powerful King of Theonia loved it, and it was also used to receive distinguished guests from other city-states. Then he would be famous throughout the Mediterranean (Athenian pottery has a characteristic, the pottery has the signature of the potter and the vase painter).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A teasing smile appeared on the corner of Hesklaus's mouth, and he said: "Okay, I will make arrangements right away." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Wait a minute, what are the requirements for the content of the vase painting?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It must be related to the "Hades Divine Code" Content, after all, the Theonian royal family is a descendant of Hades."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I understand, buy me a copy of the "Hades Divine Code" as soon as possible." Onesimus said without hesitation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Another reason why the Theonians like Athenian pottery is because the Athenian pottery vase paintings are not like the pottery vase paintings of other city-states, which are mostly still life. Its vase paintings are narrative, such as wars, heroic legends, gods, etc., and There is often a sense of tragic epicness, which may be related to the Athenians' love of drama.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The requirements that Theonia buyers often make to the Athenian pottery merchants are mostly related to the wars during the rise of the Kingdom of Theonia, the miracles of Hades, and the great deeds of King Davos. The parents of food and clothing have requirements, The vase painters could only obey. Later, a smart man actually opened a bookstore in the town of Selesia, specializing in selling books about the sacred kingdom of Theonia: "The Long March" written by Xenophon, "Magna Graecia" History by Ansitanos, Chronicle of the Western Mediterranean by Hernepolis, Chronicle of Northern Italy (consulted by Maximus, secretary of the Kingdom's Intelligence Department, in the restricted area of ​​the Library of Turii by Ansitanos Adapted from the information written by the Etruscan Frontier Corps)... Of course there is also (The Codex of Hades).
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This also makes Thracia the only place in mainland Greece, besides Messenia, New Sparta, and Thessaly, where the "Tome of Hades" is publicly sold.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Be careful! Be careful! If you break one, your three months' salary will be gone!..." The foreman kept shouting to remind the slaves who were carrying the pottery, and each piece of exquisite pottery was put into the shop. A wooden box filled with straw and thick wool.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before departure, Hesklaus repeatedly told the foreman to start making the next batch of pottery as soon as possible, but he must keep improving and make no mistakes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is a port not far from Thracia, which is dedicated to the transportation and export of pottery, but Heskraus first transported the pottery back to his house on the outskirts of Athens.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is said that it is his own house, but in fact it is only a long-term lease, because Heskraus is a foreigner and has no right to purchase real estate in Athens.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If it were four years ago, Heskraus would not have had the guts to come to Athens to settle and do business, because he was a small businessman from Thessaly, which was once regarded as a barbarian land by the Athenians, but Thessaly became Dai In a region of the Sacred Kingdom of Onia, the Thessalians became citizens of Theonia, and Heskraus was fortunate enough to meet a big businessman from Thurii, and with his support and funding, he moved his family to Athens. , engaged in pottery making.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Athens is an open city-state filled with a large number of foreigners in various industries, but most of them have low status.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Athenian citizens hate the identity of Heskraus, his identity as a Theonian citizen ensures that when he encounters trouble, the judge will not be too biased towards the locals. Of course, he must also abide by the laws of Athens, in addition to paying a certain amount regularly. In addition to taxes and occasional public donations, as a foreign merchant, he also needed to pay a small market tax that Athenian citizens were exempt from paying.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, these expenses were only a drop in the bucket of the profits he earned. What reassured him most was that because of his status, he would not be arbitrarily recruited by the Athenian government to fight as a hoplite.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, since the establishment of the New Greek Alliance, there has never been a war in mainland Greece, and the days when the people were afraid are over.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now Heskraus no longer has the desire to return to Thessaly, preferring to stay in Athens, which is full of commercial atmosphere.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the evening, Heskraus held a banquet at his home and invited several Thessalian businessmen who were doing business in Athens like him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone sat at the banquet, eating delicious food, drinking wine, and talking about the tremendous changes that Theonia had brought to Thessaly in the past few years.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not to mention other things, the format of their banquets has changed a lot. It is no longer like the traditional Greek banquet, where each guest has a couch, half-lying to eat, drink and talk. Instead, they all sit on wooden chairs. There is his own dining table in front of the body. This is due to the increasingly frequent exchanges between Theonia and Thessaly, and the impact of some native Theonia citizens migrating to the Thessaly plain.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Thessalians originally had an inferiority complex compared to mainland Greece in the south. Now they have become citizens of Theonia. Although this inferiority complex is gradually disappearing, another inferiority complex is quietly growing, that is, facing As citizens from the mainland of Theonia, the Thessalians who have close contact with the mainland of Theonia have been trying their best to learn. For example, businessmen have been trying to imitate their customs and habits in order to shorten the distance with each other.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The atmosphere of the banquet was very lively, and everyone drank a little too much. Heskraus also called his eldest son Lillias, and told him drunkenly that he would take him with him by boat to Thurii tomorrow.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The 9-year-old boy was so excited that he couldn't sleep well all night.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a result, on the morning of the second day, Hesklaus, who had sobered up, could not remember the incident at all. Lilias cried and made trouble. Finally, with his wife's persuasion, Hesklaus had to nod in agreement.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After breakfast, he took his son and the pack team to the port of Piraeus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Piraeus is the largest commercial port in the Eastern Mediterranean. Thousands of cargo ships enter and leave the port every day, making it extremely prosperous.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Heskraus came to a remote dock. Although it was still early, the place was already full of cargo ships. The ground was filled with various commodities. Countless dock laborers and slaves were busy carrying goods to the ships.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Fortunately, at the banquet last night, several Thessaly businessmen made an appointment to set off for Thurii together today. They have already booked a cargo ship and found labor (Piraeus Port regulations: non-port-owned pack teams Not allowed to enter the dock, so as not to disrupt the order of the dock and cause losses), Heskraus hurriedly asked the laborers to carefully move the wooden boxes containing his pottery one by one to the warehouse of the dock, and then the labor foreman took him into the warehouse.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the center of this huge room, which is also filled with goods, is the office of the Athenian port officials at this pier. After they confirmed the type and quantity of the goods that Heskraus wanted to transport out of Athens, they asked Hesskraus to register and sign, and then After calculating the value of the entire batch of goods based on market prices, they are required to immediately pay 1/10 tax on exported goods (Athens regulations require that both exported and imported goods must pay 1/10 tax. This is simple, crude and trouble-free, but the tax If the price is too high, the selling price of the goods will naturally be high. Once the goods are unsaleable, the owner of the goods will face losses).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Heskraus carried a large amount of Hades silver coins (Theonian coins) with him. Since the establishment of the New Hellenic League, they have become popular in mainland Greece because of their high silver content and exquisite production. The Owl of Athens Due to the depletion of the Laurian silver mines and the heavy consumption of the treasury by wars over the years, the silver content of silver coins has dropped again and again, and they are no longer as popular as they used to be. Even many Athenians prefer to use Hades silver coins. ), it was delivered immediately as requested.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is also a set of official measurement tools in the office. The clerk carefully tested the coins and confirmed that they were correct before approving Hesklaus's cargo ship to leave the port.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   By the time all the goods were loaded onto the ship and the cargo ship left the dock, it was almost noon.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hesklaus and the others were on the largest cargo ship. After the entire fleet left Salon Bay, the wind happened to turn south, and the fleet with its sails raised was speeding as if it had wings.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hesklaus and other merchants were all happy, because with the help of the sea breeze, it meant that the fleet could reach Thurii earlier.
  </font>

   Thanks to Jeanne d'Arc and βγδεζν for the reward!
