  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Thinking about what? Theonians?" Pelopidas asked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "To be precise, it should be the Theonian army." Ipamironda said frankly: "This time I went to Messenia and stayed there for several days. I was fortunate enough to visit the Theonian camp, Checkpoints, temporary ports, watching their training, logistics and transportation, and medical treatment of soldiers... I benefited a lot. In order to avoid forgetting, I took the time to record and organize them after I came back..." After listening to this,
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pelopidas , immediately understood his intention: "Do you think these beneficial things implemented by the Diolnian army can be applied to our army?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ipamilonda shook his head lightly: "Theonian is a powerful Kingdom, but we are not even unified as a whole in Boeoxia. We do not have such strong national power, and many things cannot be implemented, but we can learn from it, and more importantly, we can clarify the direction in which our army will develop in the future..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " After you finish sorting it, you must show it to me first." Pelopidas said with interest.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "That's for sure! Because then I will have a new army reform proposal to be submitted to Parliament, and I need your support." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In this regard, I have always supported you." Pelopidas did not hesitate. Agreeing, he then said: "It seems that you have determined that the Theonian army is powerful and they can defeat Sparta."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, I think even if Sparta did not experience the battle of Leuctra , they can never be the opponents of the Theonians!" Ipamironda said firmly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Even with the support of Persia?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Persia is too far away, and they cannot support Sparta unlimitedly."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Then what happens after the Theonians defeat Sparta?" Pelopidas will The topic changed: "I remember that when you came back and told the parliament about your mission to Messenia, you mentioned, 'The commander of Theonia hopes that the war in mainland Greece can stop and peace can be restored'... Do you think What does he mean by this?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Don't you think this sentence is very familiar to you! The Persians just said it not long ago." Ipamironda said meaningfully.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pelopidas was not surprised. He stood up, thinking and pacing: "You are thinking the same as me. I am afraid that the Theonians want to become the second Persia and control the situation in Greece... With the current strength of Theonia and the hostile relationship between it and Persia, it is completely understandable that they want to control Greece in their own hands. It's just... Although compared with Persia, Theonia is far away from here Closer, but their territory is not here after all. Do you think Theonia will be like Persia...pick a Sparta to control the situation here for it?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ipamironda said thoughtfully: "From It seems that the current situation is that the Theonians, like Persia, want to take control of Greece first, as a springboard, and then confront each other. However, the situation in Greece is very complicated. There are hay everywhere here, and a little spark will be accidentally touched. , it may cause a fire, so the method you just mentioned should be the best choice for the Theonians, and we must try our best to become Sparta in the hands of Dionysus, which will have a great impact on the future of Thebes. Development is of great benefit!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I think so too, and if Theonia really has such an idea, our Thebes is undoubtedly their best partner in Greece!" Although Pelopidas said this, his emotions He didn't look excited, but frowned: "It's just that the situation has changed a bit now. Before coming to your house, I met with the priest of Delphi." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Why did Delphi send the priest to Thebes?" Pamilonda immediately became alert.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pelopidas said solemnly: "The priest told me that after they heard the news of the 'Theonian army invading the Peloponnese,' they felt that something was unusual, so they asked Apollo for help. The oracle, but the Pythia saw an illusion of the temple of Delphi burning in fire. They believed that this was a warning from Apollo. If the invasion of the Theonians with heretical beliefs was not stopped, the Greek mainland would will be destroyed, so they sent priests to various city-states of the Holy Alliance, hoping that the Greek city-states could unite, just like they defeated Persia, and drive the foreign race of Theonia out of Greece..." He spoke unhurriedly before
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   . The slow and elegant Epamironda changed his expression, and he asked urgently: "How did you answer the Delphi priest?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Of course I will not agree with the Delphi priest's statement. If the gods can really give Warning, why didn't Thebes protect us back then, but allowed the Spartans to easily occupy our acropolis." Pelopidas said angrily, and then sighed: "However, after all, Delphi is among the people. It had a great influence, so I did not object openly, but said, "We in Thebes are now in a stalemate with Athens, and we have to guard against the Thessalians going south. We really have no energy left to fight against the Theonians." , not to mention that we have just signed an alliance agreement with them. Now the Diorians have fulfilled their covenant and helped us fight against our mortal enemy Sparta. How can we Thebans break our promise and betray the Diolians at this time? !'
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the damn Delphi priest accused, â€˜Thebes should never have formed an alliance with Theonia. This gave Theonia a reason to interfere in the Greek war. They had long coveted Greece. .' He asked us to terminate the alliance with Theonia as soon as possible, and also told me not to worry about the security of the territory. Delphi had already discussed with the priests of Olympia and agreed to send envoys to each city-state. It also includes Jason of Thessaly and Athens, persuading them to put aside their grudges and join forces to fight against the foreign invader Theonia..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is to form an all-Greek coalition to fight against Theonia! "Epamironda took a breath. He really didn't expect that the entry of the Theonian army into the Peloponnese would cause such a huge reaction in Delphi and Olympia, although there was almost no difference in these two places. Force, but they are the holy places in Greece and have a great influence on the people. If they are determined to oppose Theonia, the city-state governments may be able to achieve it under the pressure of the people...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He is determined Calming himself, he said: "I think...Athens is likely to agree to the suggestion of the Delphi priest, but will Jason agree? Thessaly already had the strength to fight against Sparta, but this man has been hiding himself His ambition was like a cunning wolf hiding in the northern grass. It wasn't until we defeated the Spartans at Leuctra that he began to take action. Will he use his old tricks again this time?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ia Song is indeed very shrewd, and the Delphic priest may not be able to persuade him." Pelopidas agreed, and he said solemnly: "I did not give the Delphic priest a definite answer, but tomorrow he will go to the meeting to ask All members made the request.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "So you came to me first, and then you went to other congressmen's homes to seek support?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Epamilonda understood the true purpose of his friend's visit, and he immediately asked: "Then what is your opinion on the request of the Delphi priest?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "My opinion...didn't I just say that if Theonia wants to become the second Persia, then Thebes must become the second Sparta. I have been to Persia and also to Theonia In Asia, the ordinary towns in the Kingdom of Theonia are more prosperous than many city-states in Greece, not to mention their central city of Thurii. I feel that it is no less than Babylon in Persia, and even more dynamic than Babylon! What's
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   more You just told me that Theonia's army is also very powerful! So I think that today's Greece has gathered the power of most city-states, and it is difficult to fight against the powerful Theonia. Thebes should stand Only by being on the side of the winner can our efforts over the past few years be in vain!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I support you!" Ipamilonda first expressed his attitude, and at the same time he carefully reminded: "But it is difficult for you It will be even more difficult to convince the people of Thebes with the full support of the parliamentarians. To say the least, even if you really get the council to agree to your proposal, I am afraid it will be difficult to get all the other allies of Boiosia to support our decision. By then, not only will the Boeotian Alliance we worked so hard to build disband, but Thebes will be isolated in Central Greece and even be besieged by other city-states again!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I have also considered these issues you mentioned, and of course I don't Will clearly reject the request of the Delphi priests and openly support Theonia." Pelopidas showed a sly smile: "But I can delay time! Athens, Corinth, Argos, Ellis, Foki The Greeks, the Locrians, and the Thessalians... There are many Greek city-states, and each has its own interests and needs, and there are many conflicts between them. It is impossible for Delphi and Olympia to convince them to unite in a short time. Let's deal with the Theonians together.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And even if they are convinced, it will take a lot of time for the city-states to carry out military mobilization and finally bring the troops together. Let me see... these will take at least two or three months, and Within such a long time, maybe the war between Theonia and Sparta has ended, the Theonia people will take new actions, and the situation will become clearer, which is conducive to us making new decisions. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Epamironda said thoughtfully: "I think it is possible, just because... Thessalians and Athens have not yet clearly stated their attitude, and they are still obviously hostile to Thebes, and the safety of Boiosia is still under threat. , adopt a resolution that does not express its attitude and temporarily delays the time. I believe that the MPs and people of Thebes can accept it, and it is also in the interest of other Boeotian allies."
