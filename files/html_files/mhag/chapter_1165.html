   Chapter 1165 Arcadian Alliance and Assassination
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, hearing the number spit out by Printors and seeing the continuous march of the Theonian army in front, the Arcadian councilors felt: Even if the other party said The numbers are watertight and should not differ too much.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, the councilors' attention to Theonia has once again been raised to a higher level, and some even temporarily suppressed other thoughts in their hearts.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "General Clotokatax, let me introduce to you the members of our alliance." Lycomedes's voice broke the sudden silence.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Great!" Crotokartax nodded with a smile.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This is Meletus of Mantinia..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Nice to meet you!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 ---
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crotocatacus had a sincere expression, sincere words, and elegant demeanor, leaving a lasting impression on the introduced councilors. A better impression and the whole atmosphere became friendly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, there suddenly was a small commotion among the members, and then there was a complaint: "Hey, you two, don't rush forward in a hurry, I will introduce you later."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lycomedes was stunned and hurriedly went Looking back, I wonder who was so impolite and embarrassed the alliance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Suddenly there was a shout in his ears: "Your Highness, be careful!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then, he saw the guards on the left and right sides of Commander Theonia in front of him suddenly rushing forward. At the same time, the two MPs beside him were killed. He was violently pushed down and brought down at the same time. Someone came out from behind and stepped on his hand when he landed, causing pain to his bones.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But he endured the severe pain and shouted urgently: "Be careful, there are assassins!!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two people who rushed out from the crowd, holding bright daggers, rushed towards Crotoclotokas.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Two palace guards were already standing in front of him, unsheathing their swords and stabbing each other.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   One of them was stabbed down immediately, and the other, a burly assassin, turned slightly sideways, avoiding the vital point, and endured the sword attack. Then, using the inertia of rushing forward, he knocked away the guard blocking the way.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, Printors from the side flew up and kicked him on the ankle where he was standing. He immediately fell forward. The dagger stuck on the sternum touched the ground and pierced the chest. The assassin immediately He lost his breath, and the dagger in his hand fell to the feet of Crotokatax.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crotokatax has experienced several assassinations like this, but these ones are more dangerous. His expression is still calm, he picked up the dagger, looked at it, and then pushed away the long shield shielded by the guard. , thanking the guards and Printors who intercepted the assassin.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "When I was young, I was from the Mountain Reconnaissance Brigade. It was rare that I had the opportunity to fight against the enemy in these years." Printols deliberately joked, trying to make him feel more relaxed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax hurriedly stepped forward to help Lycomedes up. In the process, the palace guards from behind rushed up, holding swords and shields, and killed dozens of panicked members of the Arcadian League. Surrounded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Lycomedes stood up, he had no time to say thanks, and regardless of the pain in his right hand, he ran towards the two assassins who fell on the ground, but was stopped by the guards.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Let me see them! Let me see them quickly!" Lycomedes shouted eagerly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crotokatax nodded in agreement.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lycomedes first looked at the assassin who was pierced by a sharp sword, and then looked at the assassin whose neck was cut and bleeding.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The assassin's mind was about to fall into coma, and he kept mumbling.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lycomedes ignored the blood soaked Bolton and listened closely: "Lord of the gods...Zeus above...the great and loving...Zeus bless...Lord of the gods...Zeus above..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because The assassin was already dying. He did not dare to ask loudly. Instead, he frowned and pondered for a while, then turned around and said to Clotoka Tax with a serious face: "Please believe us! Our Arcadia Alliance will definitely We wouldn't send people to assassinate our allies just after forming an alliance at this critical moment!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax looked at the frightened Arcadian councilors, stepped forward without any hesitation, and said loudly and seriously: "I believe you - allies of Theonia! I am afraid that some forces are afraid of seeing us forming an alliance, so they will adopt such a despicable method to make us who have just formed an alliance doubt each other!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After saying that, he waved his hand, and the palace The guards immediately put away their swords and shields and began to retreat, but there were still guards on guard on both sides of Crotokatax.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lycomedes breathed a sigh of relief for a moment, then looked at the MPs and said loudly: "Agyrus, come here and see if you recognize these two assassins. I just listened to their accents and they sounded like You people in the west."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This is absolutely impossible!" Agilus walked out of the crowd and looked at Lycomedes angrily, but he still walked quickly to the two assassins to carefully identify them, and then lay down again Listening on the ground, he finally stood up and said to Clotokatax very confidently: "These two assassins are definitely not the people of Ochomenus! But I can roughly guess where they come from!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   From Where?" Lycomedes asked urgently.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agilus said with a slightly complicated expression: "It should be near Olympia. The people there have a somewhat different honorific for the god Zeus..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Oh, you said that, I remembered it!" Lycomedes Suddenly enlightened, he hesitated for a moment, and then said to Clotokatax: "These two assassins were probably sent by the Pisa people, because they are loyal allies of the Spartans, but they may also be from the Olympians. Make your own decision..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Lycomedes did not finish what he said, Clotokatax already understood the meaning of his words: because Theonia regards Hades as the protector of the kingdom, and also enshrines him as the protector of the kingdom. As the Lord of the Greek gods, this is obviously completely different from the Greek mainland's view of gods, especially Olympia, which has the most magnificent temple of Zeus, hosts the most grand games dedicated to Zeus in Greece, and has the most devout Zeus believers in Greece. People, they undoubtedly hate the Theonian faith!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crotokatax subconsciously looked at the Temple of Zeus that was still under construction in the new city of Megalopolis. He originally wanted to take the opportunity to promote the Kingdom of Theonia's treatment of all faiths and religions. Treating everyone equally, he had done this kind of thing in Rome, but after thinking about it, he gave up the idea and said instead: "Now that everything is clear, Pisa and Olympia sent people to assassinate me in an attempt to destroy Dio. The alliance between Theonia and Arcadia prevents our Theonian army from reinforcing Arcadia. We must not let their conspiracy succeed! We must repel the invading Spartans as soon as possible, and then look back for Pisa Let's settle the score!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You're right! Mantinnia is now being besieged by the Spartans, and they are in urgent need of rescue!" a Mantinian councilor said eagerly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Other members of Congress also rushed to echo, everyone wanted to get out of this weird and embarrassing atmosphere.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What's the current situation in Mantinia?" Crotokatax looked at Lycomedes. He had previously negotiated an alliance agreement with the leader of Mantinia for two days. He didn't care about this man. I was impressed by his stability and foresight, so I was more willing to believe what he said.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lycomedes looked at his Mantinian colleagues and said in a serious tone: "We Mantinians have learned the lesson from the last destroyed city. The new city we designed and built should be said to be very strong and not afraid of the enemy. A long siege, but... we did not expect that the number of soldiers hired by Sparta would be so large and well-equipped. If the Spartans continued to launch a fierce attack, we were very worried that the city of Mantinia would not be able to resist for a long time, and this kind of This situation is very likely to happen, because the Spartans now hate our Mantinia extremely! Once the city of Mantinia falls, I am afraid that the entire city will be massacred by the Spartans this time!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crotocathak Sparta nodded empathetically and was about to speak when Printors next to him asked first: "How many people are there
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   in the Spartan army that besieged Mantinia?"
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   According to the report, the number of Spartan army soldiers is about 20,000, and the heavy infantry is no less than 6,000, and they also have more than 1,000 cavalry..." Lycomedes replied.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors compared what he said with the information detected by the mountain reconnaissance team, and he had a rough idea, and then gestured to Clotokatax with his eyes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax had calmed down at this time. Since he had almost made some impulsive promise just now, he felt a little guilty and made a please gesture.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors immediately asked: "What kind of response plan does your Arcadian Alliance have to the Spartan invasion?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After receiving the news of the Spartan invasion, our alliance has begun to respond to the Spartan invasion." The entire region is undergoing military mobilization." Lycomedes said solemnly: "But the Spartan mercenaries came from the northeast of Arcadia, and the southeast of Arcadia is adjacent to Sparta, so Citizens of the entire eastern city-state must defend their cities first. It is estimated that the alliance can only gather more than 3,000 troops, and it will take at least four or five days to get together. Then we will lead this army to fight for Mantinnia rescued the siege, but compared with the Spartan army, our numbers are too small... So in order to repel the Spartans, we urgently need your help!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It's not just a matter of rescuing Mantinnia, if Sparta's own army also attacked from the south and may directly threaten here! Then another congressman's words resonated with everyone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors looked at these worried Arcadian Alliance congressmen They said loudly: "The reinforcements of Theonia are moving eastward and are expected to arrive at the border of the Tegea region this afternoon (the area is adjacent to the Spartan territory). We will build camps there and try to make The camp was built to the east, blocking access to Tegea.
