   Chapter 1141 Leotychides
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the early days of the kingdom, the senators went to the Senate and various departments to attend meetings and handle political affairs every day, often with only one or two slaves. Later, there were several incidents of pedestrians harassing the senators, which forced the senators to They have to wear guards every day to avoid accidents.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because according to the law, slaves were not allowed to carry weapons, and freedmen who carried weapons on the streets in Thurii would also be subject to strict inspections and interrogations by the supervisory team. Only citizens were relatively tolerant, thus giving birth to a special society in Thurii. Industry - Elder Guards (In fact, some wealthy businessmen and officials later hired guards).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If you want to establish a guard company, you must not only obtain a business license from the Commerce Department, but also obtain approval from the Turiyi Supervision Office, and it must also be supervised by the Turiyi Military Camp, because the vast majority of people who serve as guards are Legionnaires or reserve soldiers must be coordinated with the military training in the military camp. Therefore, they are often funded by retired team officers in the legion. Incidentally, they also solve the livelihood problems of some injured retired soldiers, so they are also affected by military affairs. ministry support.

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Leoticides passed through the east gate of the inner city, the city guards all saluted respectfully to this famous military commander in the kingdom.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides's mansion is located next to a relatively lively street. It is not small in area. It is a typical "sun"-shaped double-story residence most commonly built by wealthy people in Theonia. On the street side of the mansion Several shops have also been opened and rented out to traders.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Standing at the main entrance was a male servant holding a big yellow dog, staring eagerly at the door, which made passers-by afraid to stay for a long time.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But when Leoticides arrived at the door, the big, ferocious-looking dog waggled its tail and pounced on him excitedly, licking and nuzzling him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leotychides patted it hard on the head, and the big dog immediately fell silent.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then, Leoticides strode into the mansion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This mansion looks decent on the outside, but it looks simple on the inside. There are no mosaic floors in the surrounding corridors, no pool and statues in the center of the front courtyard, no garden in the backyard, and no pavilion in the middle for chatting and drinking. The front and back yards are completely connected, forming a large mud playground in the middle.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On one side of the playground, his 7-year-old son was practicing riding a horse, and on the other side his 17-year-old eldest son was practicing fighting skills with a manservant holding a shield and sword (Leotichides originally had three children, the second daughter Died a few years after birth).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   His wife sat on the corridor next to the playground and watched, with two dogs crawling at her feet. The originally sleepy dogs suddenly stood up and ran towards the door like they were having fun.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hearing their excited cries, the wife realized that her husband had returned home. She immediately went to greet her: "Why are you back so late today?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The Ministry of Military Affairs has important matters to discuss." Leoticides said , tore off the veteran Bolton he was wearing, and shouted to the playground: "Teltotis, I will accompany you to practice!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Okay!" The eldest son, Tertotis, stopped attacking and replied loudly. : "Father, I will not give up easily this time!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides strode into the playground, took the wooden shield and wooden sword from the slave, put himself in a posture, and said in a deep voice: "Come on."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Look. Watching the father and son fighting on the field, Retina showed a puzzled look. After living with Leoticides for so many years, she could feel that her husband was a little excited. This situation was so rare that she couldn't help but have some doubts in her heart: What happened? What's up?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, the youngest son Pagandas got off his horse, quickly ran to the sidelines, picked up a can of water, and drank it in big gulps.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Refena hurriedly said: "Pagandas, don't drink too much, it's not good for your health! I soaked a big watermelon in the well and cut it for you to quench your thirst."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This decoration of Leonticides's house It is very simple. It doesn't look like a senator's mansion. The only extravagance is that when she first built the house, Ruifena spent a lot of money to hire someone to drill a private well at home. The bottom of the well is deep and the water in the well is bitingly cold. It is usually more It is used to keep vegetables and fruits fresh.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Oh." Pagandas put down the water jug ​​obediently and sat on the ground, watching his father and brother fighting. Rafena pulled him up and kicked him hard on the butt: "Look at you. Your whole body is covered in sweat, so go take a bath first!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After driving her little son away, Ruifena shouted to the two female slaves who were following her: "It will get dark soon, so don't stay here. Come on, hurry up to the kitchen and urge them to prepare dinner as soon as possible!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Twenty years later, even though Leoticides has reached the top of the kingdom and has a distinguished status, the fierce temper of Ruifena, who was born in Brutus, has not diminished. then.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the dinner table, when Rafena asked again, "What good thing happened today?", Leoticides finally put down the beef bone he was chewing and said seriously: "Your Majesty has decided to support Thebes. Please send troops to the Peloponnese to attack Sparta, and let me - be the commander of this expeditionary army."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Father, you want to lead troops to conquer Sparta?!" The younger son exclaimed, and the elder His son Tertotis also looked surprised.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the past, Leoticides didn't have much time to go home, and every time he returned home to stay with the children, he either trained them or told them some stories after training, and most of the content of these stories was They are all about Spartan legends and heroes, hoping that the children will gradually develop a feeling of admiration for Sparta, but in fact the effect is not very obvious. The children are more eager to defeat Sparta, a treacherous enemy. Villains, after all they spend more time in school.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Ruifena is careless, she is actually very shrewd. At the beginning of her marriage, she was completely unfamiliar with things in Greece, but after so many years, she has gained some understanding. Her husband is an Argos and should hate Sparta. , but this was not the case in normal conversations, which inevitably made her confused, but Leoticides did not say anything, and she never took the initiative to ask, but now she couldn't help but ask: "You didn't accept this Appointment?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Of course I accepted it." Leoticides looked at his wife and seemed to understand what she was thinking. He rarely said more: "I am happy to teach the Spartans a lesson!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is What he really thought was that when he fled Sparta, he swore a poisonous oath: One day, he would lead his army back to Sparta and kill all the Spartans who had humiliated him and forced his mother to commit suicide. Kill!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the palace meeting hall, the reason why he behaved abnormally was because he did not expect that a good opportunity to fulfill his vow would suddenly come to him, and he was trying his best to suppress the excitement in his heart.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Tirtotis." Leoticides continued: "This time you go on an expedition with me."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Great!" Tertotis almost jumped up with excitement.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Ruifena reminded her defensively: "Tairtotis is not yet 18 years old and cannot serve in the military!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "He is with me and serves as my handyman. He does not have to go into battle to kill the enemy." Leotic After Des finished speaking, he immersed himself in eating, which made the family feel uneasy.

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Regarding the possible changes in the situation in Greece after the Battle of Leuctra, although Davos held many meetings to analyze and judge this, the development of the matter was still It exceeded their expectations.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   First of all, the armistice agreement signed between Thebes and Sparta was so fast that Theonia was caught off guard, but this did not affect their preparations, and the expedition was still proceeding in an orderly manner.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Secondly, Jason's series of performances after the battle aroused Davos' vigilance, and he specifically ordered Aristiras to strengthen surveillance in Thessaly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then, Davos and the others originally thought that the failure of the Battle of Leuctra would cause Sparta to desperately seek revenge in order to regain its prestige. However, they did not expect that Sparta quickly signed the armistice agreement and did not really do anything in the subsequent time. The reason for any hostile actions against Thebes is that the impact of this battle on Central Greece and the entire Peloponnese Peninsula was beyond the expectation of the top leaders of Theonia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After all, Davos and the others did not live in mainland Greece, and they had almost never suffered a defeat in the wars they experienced. They could not understand the feelings of the Greek people towards Sparta. Dating back to after the Messenian War and before the Greco-Persian War, Sparta The Spartans dominated the entire Greece. Their long-term strength gave the Greek people an inherent concept: Unless the enemy has a huge advantage in strength, the Spartan hoplites are simply invincible in a battle. This is Unbreakable principles.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But in this huge battle for the Greeks, the Thebans actually defeated Sparta with a small number and a large number, and their king even died in the battle. You must know that since Leonidas was at the gate of Greece Since the sacrifice of Thermopylae, no Spartan king has died in battle. Therefore, when the detailed process of the battle spread throughout Greece, many city-state people suddenly realized: It turns out that the Spartans are not so terrible. The Thebes If people can do it, maybe we can do it too.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a result, many city-states were incited.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After signing the Treaty of Callias two months ago, according to the contract, Sparta should have withdrawn its military commanders stationed in various city-states. The Spartans have been delaying in not fulfilling the treaty. Now these city-states are boldly sending these Spartans to the city-states. The military commander sent by Bada drove him out.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What's even worse for Sparta is that, as an oligarchic city-state, it has always promoted and supported the oligarchic system in the city-states and alliance states it controls, and these oligarchs who have gained power will have a negative impact on the democrats in the city. People were persecuted and the ordinary people in the country were exploited (on the one hand, it was also to meet Sparta's military needs).
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now inspired by the victory of the Thebans, exiled democrats in various city-states returned to their home states one after another, inciting the already dissatisfied people and setting off a wave of riots.
