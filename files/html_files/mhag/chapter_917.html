   Chapter 917 The Security of Apulia
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before Sedorum finished speaking, Felicius interjected: "There is still the Ninth Legion stationed in the Apulia region. Because of His Majesty's reminder, the Ministry of Military Affairs specially asked the Ninth Legion to stay in Udiai. The purpose of accompanying Alexis on the expedition to the Samnite Mountains is to prevent such a thing from happening, and I believe that the commander of the Tagetinos Army will be able to easily defeat the incoming enemy."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I believe that our legion can easily defeat those rabble, but I am worried that these former fugitive leaders of Messapi, Pucetti, and Dauni will cause turmoil in the area after returning to Apulia, just like Just like Bruti during the South Italian War." Cedorom talked about the past with a somewhat complicated mood: the chaos in the Bruti region gave him the opportunity to show his talents, which laid the foundation for him to become the rotating chairman of the Senate now. However, unrest and riots also caused the entire Bruti region to fall into war, the population was greatly reduced, and many tribes disappeared.

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Please rest assured, sirs, it has been almost 10 years since the Pucheti region was incorporated into the kingdom. The people there live a free and prosperous life, and are proud of being Theonian citizens. They are unlikely to be incited by these lost dogs that have long been forgotten by them. Launch a riot and return to the poverty era ruled and controlled by kings and chiefs. On the contrary, they will cooperate with the kingdom's army to drive away these thugs who want to take away their happiness!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The person who spoke was none other than Thorex, the leader of the large Silvim tribe in the central town of Puchetti region and the future father-in-law of Prince Adoris. The Puchetti senators were not only headed by him, but also he was the leader of the Puchetti senators. He is also quite prestigious among the people of Ti, so his words reassured the elders present.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Immediately afterwards, Apirosia, another senator who played an important role in Messapia (he was also the father-in-law of the palace clerk Hernipolis), stood up at this moment and said loudly: "We Messapia merged with Dionysus It will take longer. I can assure you here that the Mesapian people will only regard these former Mesapians who landed in Apulia as outsiders and as thugs who want to destroy their peaceful life. The people will Fully support the Kingdom's army to defeat them!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The speeches made by the senators Pucetti and Mesapi one after another caused the eyes of other senators to unconsciously focus on another senator - Lugo Semblon.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The identity of this senator from Dauni is very important. He is the former king of Dauni. In the war of Theonia conquering Daoni 4 years ago, he opened the city and surrendered in Lucenia early, which made Alexi Sri Lanka successfully conquered the Dauni region. In order to appease the Daoni people and stabilize the people's hearts, Lugosembulon was warmly received by Davos and was given a banquet. Not long after, he became a senator of Theonia. He became the youngest senator of the Senate. (He was only 27 years old at the time, and he is only 31 years old now).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After joining Theonia, the former Dauni king, who had a weak personality and could not convince the public, had always kept to himself and was not too keen on politics. His attendance at regular meetings of the Senate had always been a routine matter, and he rarely spoke or argued. He devoted all his energy to the sport of football. Not only did he practice regularly, but he also spent money to form a team to participate in football matches in the Turiyi region. Therefore, he was nicknamed the "football veteran" by the Turiyi people.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was rare for him to receive such attention in the Senate, and he was inevitably a little nervous. He muttered: "You...you don't have to worry about Dauni, because...because not many Daoni escaped in the first place."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What Lugosembronn said is true. It took the shortest time to conquer Dauni in the Apulian region. It only took one battle on the Ofanto River and the siege of Sipentum. After the war, various tribes in Daoni towns surrendered one after another. Of course, the surrender of Lugo Semblon played a great role in setting an example.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After his reminder, the senators suddenly understood and felt more at ease.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Once these thugs land in Apulia, I suggest that three adults, Torrex, Apirosia, and Lugo Zemblon, can go to Pucetti, Messapi, and Dauni respectively to assist the administrators of the region. Calm the people and organize defense..." Sedorum expressed his opinion loudly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Most of the senators agreed to this proposal, and Torrex and Ampirosia did not object. Only Lugosembronn was very reluctant, but in such an atmosphere, he did not dare to refute, so he could only Accept silently.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Since the entire Apulian region has to prepare for the game, is there no need to notify the towns in Apulia to participate in this rugby final?" Lysias asked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Don't!" Torrex immediately expressed his objection. He reminded with a serious look: "Even if the remaining forces who have fled abroad attack the Pucheti area, they will not cause panic among the people, but if they are not allowed to participate The rugby finals may really cause turmoil in the entire region!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The same is true in the Mesape region." Apirocia also said immediately: "The people have regarded the rugby finals as a major festival, and they will never allow the teams in their towns to be absent. I think the enemy chooses Attacking Apulia at this time is the wrong idea and the people will be even more angry to fight back against these thugs who are ruining their enjoyment of the game."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I have long heard that the people of Apulia are obsessed with rugby matches. It seems that it is not a rumor!" Lysias sighed and retracted what he said before.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Messapei and Pucheti people are relatively fierce races. After being conquered by Theonia, the people were still unwilling to accept it, and the rugby finals became the best place for them to express their unyielding and resistance, so initially In a few years, their players were not yet proficient in rugby skills and their tactics were even simpler. However, relying on their tenacious spirit of refusing to admit defeat, they repeatedly staged comebacks and defeated the powerful Magna Graecia teams in the finals. After the winning team returned to the city, the players will be sought after by the public, which further promotes the development of rugby in the local area. Although in recent years, as the people of Apulia have completely integrated into Theonia, this oppositional sentiment no longer exists, but rugby has become the most popular sport in the region, even more enthusiastic than Turi Yi.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just when some elders who didn't know much about the Apulian region were curiously listening to the elders who had served as chief administrators of various towns in the region, whispering about the reasons why Apulian people like rugby, they suddenly heard Serdorum telling him Hieros asked: "Do these remnants of Apulia attack us with Spartan support? If so, did the Spartans also send troops to participate?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Many elders felt nervous.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hilos said with a smile: "The rebels headed by Vardarka must have obtained the consent of the Spartans in gathering troops in the Peloponnese region. However, there is currently no intelligence showing that there are Spartans or other Spartans. The army of the city-state of Loponnese joined them. I think the most important reason, and everyone should know it, is that the Spartans are now busy fighting against the new alliance formed by Athens and Thebes."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing this, Weispa breathed a sigh of relief and said repeatedly: "That's good, that's good!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Some senators in the venue joked: "Master Vespa, don't worry, Master Bagule is not satisfied. I'm afraid he still wants to capture a few Spartans in Udia!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as laughter erupted in the venue, Antaoris stood up and said in a hateful voice: "Sparta is in a difficult situation now and has not forgotten to cause trouble for us. It seems that its attitude towards the kingdom has not changed. Wait until we solve it Carthage, we must let the Spartans know how powerful we are."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   These words were unanimously recognized by the senators.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the end of the veteran hospital, Weasba did not accept Hermeng's invitation -to go to the Kristo restaurant in the city to drink a few glasses and talk about it, but returned to his mansion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as he entered the backyard, he met his daughter-in-law Andrea.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Father, you are back!" Andrea came up to greet her and asked with concern: "Today's Senate meeting seems to have ended much later than usual. You must be exhausted!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Weisba glanced at her and said naturally: "There are many issues today, and everyone's debates are quite intense. One of the issues has a lot to do with Bagule."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What is it?!" Andrea asked immediately.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "When the kingdom conquered the Apulian region, the Messapian, Pucetti, and Donidori people who fled to mainland Greece had already assembled an army..." Vespa did not hesitate to tell what should have been a secret. He told Andrea what happened.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even though the Kingdom of Theonia is relatively tolerant of women, it rarely allows women to participate in politics. This is especially true of Lucania's tradition. Andrea is an alien daughter-in-law. Weisba's initial request for her was More harshly, the reason why there have been earth-shaking changes now is that on the one hand, his sense of superiority as the leader of Lucania no longer exists, Theonia is getting stronger and stronger, and new people in the Senate have emerged in large numbers, which makes him constantly produce Sense of crisis. On the other hand, Andrea has been greatly trained as Queen Kristoya's right-hand assistant over the years. Bagule has been working abroad all year round. Many times, Weisba has to rely on his daughter-in-law to analyze the situation for him. , follow her suggestions.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Andrea heard this, she did not show the same worry as Weisba did when she first heard it. Instead, she comforted her: "Father, you don't have to worry. Since the Ministry of Military Affairs has made full preparations, your Senate has also made careful preparations." With the arrangement, there will be no trouble in Apulia. Bagule will be very safe, and I think this is a good thing. The kingdom can take the opportunity to catch all these escapees and completely stabilize the Apulia region. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Weisba looked at his daughter-in-law's calm and confident face and was stunned for a moment before murmuring: "Yes, yes, you are right..."
