   Chapter 1094 Helps and Haka
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Originally, Davos was going to follow the etiquette of the Kingdom of Theonia and wait for the other party to finish the salute before saying some words of comfort. Unexpectedly, Haka's first words made him cry. Stunned, he said casually: "My student?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka looked at Davos with admiration, and said sincerely: "Yes, Your Majesty. The Kingdom of Theonia you created was led by you. This political system that was formulated fascinates me very much. I have been studying it, and I have applied some of my experiences to the governance of southern Iberia from time to time. However, there are still many shortcomings, so this time I came to Turii, I want to learn from you!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Henipolis, who was following closely behind to disembark, couldn't help but rolled his eyelids when he heard this: "Well, you Haka, you don't seem to like to talk much, but when you talk about it, Come on, you are so good at flattering!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos smiled happily, stepped forward to hold Haka's hands, and said continuously: "You manage the southern Iberia region very well, especially for those in the territory. Some of the governance strategies implemented by various Iberian tribes are even more unique, and they are worth learning from! So, this teacher... I don't dare to be, you are very talented in handling government affairs, and you are completely capable of being on your own!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It's just that the affairs of the kingdom are complicated now, and there are many problems that need to be solved urgently. It also gives me a headache, so everyone and I are looking forward to you! I believe that with your joining and brainstorming with us, there will be more innovative ideas. The resolution was issued to take the governance of the kingdom to a higher level!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka immediately replied: "I am very willing to come to Turiyi to contribute more to the kingdom!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Okay! Okay!" Davos smiled, Patting his hand gently, looking at him with concern, he said: "But before I put more burden on you, I have to nurse you back to health first. Otherwise, if you fall ill, Didok will have to settle the score with me." !"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the eyes of Davos, Haka was extremely thin and his face was dark and gloomy. He looked completely sick. You must know that he was less than 30 years old, which made Davos feel... Shocked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Thank you for taking care of Dido these years!" Haka expressed his gratitude again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Hi, I haven't thanked your family for raising such a good daughter-in-law for me! Dido has always been beautiful, virtuous, smart and capable, and she also gave birth to a lovely grandson for our family. The whole family likes her very much! ... ..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone around showed kind smiles. Some people saw the two of them chatting up and suddenly realized that although it was Haka's first time to come to Turiyi, he and King Davos were relatives, and Seeing how harmoniously he gets along with His Majesty, I may have to change my attitude towards him in the future.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Helps!" Davos said, suddenly shouting back.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Medical Minister Helps responded immediately.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I leave the treatment and nursing care of Haka to you. You have to go to see the doctor in person to ensure Haka's health!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Your Majesty!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka was a little frightened and said immediately: "Your Majesty, this... Helps is an important minister of the kingdom and a famous doctor respected by the people. How can I work for his old man with such a minor illness... I am wasting his precious time! -" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I am a doctor, how can I say that when I treat people? It's a waste of time!" Helps stepped forward, looked at Haka carefully, and suggested to Davos with some worry: "Your Majesty, Sir Haka's face is not very good. It may be due to the long boat ride and too much time. He is overtired. I suggest that he go back to his residence to rest as soon as possible so that he can regain his energy!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos already had this idea, and after being reminded by Helps, he took it even more seriously, and immediately said cautiously: "You said That's right! Well, Haka, you go back to your new residence to rest first, and let Helps treat you. When you recover, you can slowly get acquainted with the senators at the Senate meeting. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty, I am in good health now and have no problems. I just want to take this opportunity to get to know my colleagues!" Haka was so embarrassed that he left in a hurry without meeting and thanking these elders who came to greet him, so he quickly expressed his stance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lord Haka, don't force yourself, your health is very important to the kingdom!" Lysias, the rotating chairman of the Senate, hurriedly advised: "His Majesty has always been very concerned about the health of our senators, and everyone will understand this. You Don't worry, we will have plenty of opportunities in the future to get to know each other slowly."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "But..." Haka still wanted to express his objection.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos said to Henepolis simply: "That's it. Send Lord Hakkar to his mansion first... Oh, by the way, where is Hasdrubal?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "He... well, he drank too much. He was sleeping on the boat. I was afraid of disturbing His Majesty, so I didn't wake him up..." Haka said bravely.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, Davos saw the trick, but he didn't expose it. Instead, he said with some concern: "In this case, don't wake him up. After you all have a rest and regain your energy, I will hold a banquet at the palace to welcome you! I heard that Hasdrubal loved drinking. I have the best wine and beer in the Western Mediterranean, and there are also many military veterans who are good drinkers. When the time comes, Make sure he drinks to his heart's content!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to welcome Haka's arrival, Davos and the Senate have made a lot of efforts, such as preparing a residence for him , it stands to reason that the inner city has long since run out of space to build mansions for the senators. Some of the senators who later joined the kingdom lived near the outer city area close to the inner city. This time, the Senate specifically posted a notice on the notice board in front of the Grand Council Hall to purchase a house. An announcement was made to buy houses from the people in the inner city and promised great discounts, but few people responded. In the end, Sostatus, a big businessman of the Thurii Chamber of Commerce, left his father Kunogolata in The residence in the inner city was transferred to the Senate in exchange for a piece of public land in the outer city and Davos's approval.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Construction Department specially sent people to carefully repair the residence. After Haka, Hasdrubal and the others arrived in Thurii, they moved directly into the new mansion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just as Helps expected, Haka took a long boat ride and this morning worked hard to see the entire city of Thurii on the Craty River. He blew the river wind for a long time, but he fell ill as soon as he moved into the mansion. Erps took medical staff to diagnose and treat him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At dusk, Helps rushed to Davos's mansion again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Master Haka has been exposed to the river wind for a long time, so he caught a cold. He has been given medicine. I believe he will get better within a day or two after he develops a fever..." Helps reported.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Thankfully you reminded me in time today!" Davos was temporarily relieved. He knew very well: Haka had just arrived in Turiyi and there must be no problems!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Otherwise, the people in Iberia and the Phoenicians in other areas would have bad guesses. For example, when Haka was in good condition in Iberia, he became seriously ill and bedridden as soon as he arrived in Thurii. This must be Dio. The murderous hand of the king of Nia and the senators!

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty." Helps continued with a worried look: "After examining Lord Haka's body, I found that the reason why he is frail and sickly is because he suffers from heart disease...his The heart sounds are very loud, very noisy, very similar to many patients with heart diseases that I have treated before... We once obtained your consent and the consent of the patient's family, and under the witness of Hades God, we performed several An autopsy was performed on a patient who had this kind of heart disease and eventually died of the disease, and it was found that their hearts were somewhat different from those of normal people. There were leaks in places that should be closed, and seals in places that should not be closed... Moreover, they It seems that I have had such a problem since I was born, so I-" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So, you named it 'primary heart disease'. I have listened to a series of speeches you gave on this aspect at scholar conferences in the past few years. , this is a very remarkable discovery!" Davos praised, but his brows were still shrouded in gloom. He asked straightforwardly: "As far as I know, 'primary heart disease' cannot be Treatment, then based on Haka's current physical condition, how long can you estimate how long he can live?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty, according to our current level of medical skills, it is indeed impossible to treat this disease. In fact, we found that 'primary heart disease' should There are many types, and we are working hard to classify them bit by bit through dissection... This is a very long process. But according to our statistics and observations of these patients, all those who can live to be over 20 years old For this kind of patient, the heart disease he suffers from is usually relatively mild. As long as his living conditions are good, he does not engage in excessive work, and he can receive timely treatment, his lifespan will be relatively long..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   That's good! That's good!" Dai Firth relaxed his brows, relaxed his whole body, and said in a gentle tone: "Thank you for your hard work, Helps. I will leave Haka's long-term treatment and recuperation to you in the future." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty, please rest assured, although we cannot cure it. This disease, but it can still be done to delay Master Haka's symptoms!" Helps said confidently.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's getting late. Come and dine at my place tonight."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, I received urgent news from the hospital on the way here. They received a seriously ill patient, and the onset of illness was very strange. I need to rush past the hospital. Consult this patient."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Okay, then I won't keep you."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Helps saluted respectfully and turned around to leave.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos saw that his figure was a bit stooped, his hair was gray, his gait was slightly trembling, and he looked very old. He was deeply touched and couldn't help but said: "Helps, you should take more care of yourself." ! I can't live without you, just like when I was in Persia more than 20 years ago..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Helps' body shook slightly. He turned around and saluted Davos respectfully again, just like he did more than 20 years ago. Every time he responded to Davos's instructions, he said: "Yes, teacher!"
  </font>
