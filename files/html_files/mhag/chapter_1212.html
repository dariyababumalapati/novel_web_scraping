   Chapter 1212 Landing in Thessaly (4)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Lamians are not too panicked about this. Over the past hundred years, they have continued to transform the hills around the city, making the hillsides on the side of the city completely unfavorable for climbing. Moreover, the parallel distance between the mountain top and the city is a hundred meters away. If you shoot arrows at the Lamians in the city from a high position, the threat will be greatly reduced.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But soon the Lamians began to panic: palm-sized boulders kept whizzing down from the tops of the mountains on both sides, and even the strongest houses were easily smashed by them like paper. The people were unfortunately hit by one, and even more so. The death was so miserable that even the temple of the Acropolis could not escape its attack. After just over 10 minutes, the core city of Lamia became chaotic.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just when Lamia was panicking, Patroclus sent an envoy and made a stern request: As long as Lamia surrenders immediately, Theonia will ensure the safety of the people of Lamia, otherwise the city will be completely destroyed. , turning all the people in the city into slaves!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Nowadays, the war of Theonia in Greece has become the focus of attention of the whole Greek people. Of course, the Lamians know the tragic experience of the people of Tegea before, not to mention that they have just seen the Theonia who brought Olia The army's huge numbers and fierce tactics made it difficult to resist, so they had no choice but to surrender in Kaicheng.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Patroclus fulfilled his promise and did not harm the surrendered people of Lamia, but he sent two large armies to garrison the acropolis in the city and completely controlled the city-state.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was already afternoon, and it was no longer realistic to lead the army over the mountains to the north and into Thessaly. However, Partroclus did not let the soldiers rest, but issued an order to attack south.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, except for the 12th Legion and the Gallic Brigade, the other legions did not participate in the battle. They got enough rest in front of the city of Lamia. They were more eager to win a victory with their own hands.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So the soldiers of the 10th and 11th legions and the 3rd cavalry legion energetically followed the route that the Persian army had taken when they invaded Greece decades ago, quickly crossed the Sperceos River, and arrived at Hercules at dusk. Lacria.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Heraclea is opposite the city of Lamia, only a dozen miles away. It is located at the northern foot of the mountains in northern Central Greece. It is the northern gate into Central Greece from Thessaly.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There are two roads to the south through it. One is to go directly south, trekking through the trails between the mountains, and finally entering Doris. However, the mountains on the northern border are continuous and towering, and the mountain roads are bumpy and difficult to navigate. The transportation is extremely inconvenient and is not conducive to the passage of large troops. Therefore, The Persian army did not choose to take this route at first. Instead, after reaching Heraclea, they turned eastward, passed through Thermopylae near the coast, and then went south along the coast. As a result, the Spartan king Leonius The legendary story of Da led 300 soldiers to resist the Persian army alone and finally died heroically.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Sparta defeated Athens and became the overlord of Greece, it kept Heraclea and Thermopylae in its hands.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the Battle of Leuctra, Jason led the Thessalian army to destroy Heraclea and control Thermopylae, but he soon regretted it, because Thermopylae was just a pass, and the area there was extremely narrow and was not conducive to large-scale expansion. The troops were stationed for a long time and could only rely on the logistical support of Heraclea, which was very close to it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to control the road south for a long time, Jason had to rebuild the city of Heraclea.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But a few months later, the Theonian army landed in the Peloponnese, triggering a new war. When Jason led the army south again, Heraclea had just built a circle of earth walls and did not even have a city gate. , he left 3,000 soldiers to garrison, and hurried southward.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   3,000 soldiers is a large number for any Greek city-state. Even if the city is not perfect, but it occupies a dangerous position, it is enough to block possible attacks from these Greek city-states in the south and ensure the retreat of Thessaly's army. Safety.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But Jason never expected that the attack came from the north, and that the number of soldiers was so large and the attack was so fierce. Three thousand Thessalian soldiers were soon surrounded and defeated by the Theonian soldiers who poured into the city crazily. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, night was almost falling, and Patroclus stood on the earth wall, looking to the east.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The afterglow of the setting sun coated the earth with a layer of gold, and the scenery that caught his eye was extremely clear, but even so, he could not see the outline of the hot spring pass nicknamed "Hot Spring Pass" (there are many hot springs near the hot spring pass, causing It was always hot there (hence the name).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pressing the regret in his heart, he ordered: the soldiers camped on the spot to recuperate and prepare for fighting again tomorrow.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ……………………………… ………………

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the Theonian armies in the south gathered in the city of Lamia, the legions in the north also passed through the valley pass, 4 infantry legions and a cavalry legion, plus a Ba Leari's slinger brigade (2,000 people), a total of nearly 40,000 people, rested for a while at the mouth of the valley. Matonis and Lizaru ordered at the same time: March southward, targeting Larissa.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This time, the army did not make a sudden march. The soldiers formed a column with a wide front, marching southward on the flat and soft land along the south bank of the Pinhos River. The 3rd Cavalry Corps was at the front of the queue.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Larissa City Located in the center of the northern plain of Thessaly, on the banks of the Plios River, it has vast farmland and a large population. It was once a powerful state in the northern plain of Thessaly and has long been the central city of Thessaly. But in the Philippines After the rise of Larissa, Jason conquered this neighboring city-state and deliberately suppressed it, causing its strength to be much weaker than before. When Jason carried out military mobilization this time, he also specifically emphasized that Larissa must provide There are less than 5,000 soldiers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For this reason, Larissa recruited most of the young and middle-aged citizens to join the army, and just a few hours ago, they received orders from Polydorus: The Theonian army is on the coast of Mildorus After landing, the city-states sent troops to reinforce as soon as possible!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Larissa had to urgently send another 1,000 citizen soldiers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   By the time Peleus's messenger came to ask for help, the Larissa people had almost no troops to send, but they knew very well "It's nothing if Peleus is captured, but once the Theonian army passes through the valley pass and rushes into the northern plain of Thessaly, it will be an extremely terrifying thing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So Larissa had to piece together nearly 300 more The soldiers (including some citizens over 50 years old) asked them to rush to the valley entrance camp to defend themselves, and at the same time sent a messenger to Polydorus for reinforcements.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Halfway through Larissa's reinforcements, they saw the ground in front of them being raised. The dust was shrouded, and even the earth was trembling slightly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Theonian army has arrived!... The Larissa people looked at the countless vague soldiers in the dust and mist, and were almost frightened, and turned around and ran away
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   . At the same time, the Second Theonian Cavalry Corps also discovered them and immediately chased them. The Larissa reinforcements, who had no fighting spirit, raised their hands to surrender.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although it was already the afternoon, Matonis and Lizaru learned from the interrogated prisoners that the city defenses of Larissa were empty and there was a serious shortage of major generals, and that all the troops left behind in Thessaly were concentrated on the coast of Almiros, facing Dai Dai. Nothing was known about the Onian army's attack from Peleus... Both commanders thought this was an excellent fighting opportunity and immediately ordered the army to speed up.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Larissa is nearly 40 miles away from the mouth of the valley, and it is all a smooth road. The soldiers of the Theonia Legion marched normally all the way, and their physical strength has gradually recovered. After receiving the order, they started running wildly again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   By the time we saw the outline of the city of Larissa in the distance, the sun had already set in the western mountains, leaving only a few rays of afterglow on the horizon, and night was about to fall.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Both Matonis and Lizaru were decisive commanders. Since they had made a decision before, they would never change it easily. The order to "attack the city of Larissa" was immediately issued.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The city of Larissa uses the Pinhos River and its tributaries as a natural barrier. It originally had a defensive advantage. However, they had just sent away the reinforcements a few hours ago and had not received any unusual news. It was already getting late, so they naturally felt worried. As a result, when the sentries at the top of the city saw the enemy troops coming like a tide in the distance, they sounded the alarm in horror.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The panicked Larissa people wanted to close the city gates and urgently mobilize people to defend the city. The city was in chaos and there was no time to burn the pontoon bridge on the river.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Theonian soldiers stepped on the pontoon bridge on the tributary of the Pinos River and quickly arrived at the city of Larissa. In the process, they did not even suffer long-range attacks from bows, arrows and javelins at the top of the city.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When they put up the wooden siege ladders on the city wall, the Larissa people who were rushing to get there took their rusty weapons and hurriedly climbed up to the top of the city. Failure was naturally inevitable.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Reporting to the two commanders, we have captured the city of Larissa!" The messenger excitedly reported loudly to Matonis and Lizaru.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Which army captured the city first?" Matonis asked with a smile.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The Eighth Brigade of the Second Army."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Matonis smiled brighter and turned to look at his side: "Oh, Lizaru, I'm sorry, my men won the first prize again!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lizaru said coldly. He said in a loud voice: "The Larissa people didn't resist at all. Is this considered a credit? The second legion just took advantage of being in front of the team!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I said Lizaru, you don't know what is good and what is good. If it wasn't for the second legion, The Second Army Corps opened the valley pass in time, and I inform you in time that you may still be climbing in the mountains of Macedonia with your troops!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   That's because the Ministry of Military Affairs believes in my ability, so it assigned the most difficult task to me. Leave it to me, and leave the easiest task to you."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Two veterans in their 50s were quarreling with each other like children. The surrounding staff officers and guards could not come out to dissuade them, so they could only hold back their faces. Smiling, standing like a clay puppet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two quarreled for a while, and Matonis suddenly remembered something and said to the messenger who was standing aside very uncomfortable: "Go and inform the troops entering the city immediately. They are not allowed to rob the people of Larissa of their property or harm their lives. If there is any Violation will be punished by military law!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes!"
