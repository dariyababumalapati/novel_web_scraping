   Chapter 1238 Aviya's Marriage
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Without your help, sir, I wouldn't be where I am today!" Heskraus quickly expressed his stance: "I am willing to serve you, sir!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hey, we are mutually beneficial and help each other, no one has to work for the other. Service." Saustatus said simply: "If one day you want to develop independently, no problem, just tell me directly. My father once said to me, 'The more friends you have, the wider the road. 'I have always kept this in mind and implemented it, so I am where I am today. Even if you want to be independent in the future, I will still support you. We are still friends and can still help each other." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dare not! Dare not! Heskraus said repeatedly, but he kept Saustatus' words in mind.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Let me tell you something serious." Saustatus suddenly became serious: "It is precisely because my pottery shop in the inner city is very famous that His Majesty Davos knew about it, so he ordered a batch from me. Pottery, the order I sent you 7 days ago is what he wants! You must use the best clay, the best potter, and the best vase painter. According to the requirements I mentioned before, use the shortest possible time. Time to make the most exquisite pottery and send it to Thurii. If it can satisfy His Majesty... Think about it, we may become pottery merchants specializing in supplying to the royal family. By then, the entire kingdom and the kingdom's The people of the allied countries will definitely be proud to own our pottery! More importantly, to satisfy His Majesty, if I mention that you are from Peleus and come from his hometown, then he will definitely look at you differently, don't you think so? ?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hesklaus opened his mouth wide and froze on the spot. He had no idea that the previous order was so important to him. He had paid enough attention to it, but now it seemed that it was not enough. He immediately said: "I Rush back to Athens tomorrow and personally urge the workers to produce the best of the best!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Saustatus nodded and comforted: "You don't have to worry, the sports meeting will not be held until a month later, so there is enough time. , I will have bought the tickets for the opening ceremony and some important matches by then, so you don't have to worry about it, just concentrate on doing this well!... Oh, and this little guy -"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sostatus patted Li .
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Rias' head: "Don't let him go back and forth. Just stay at my house and I will have someone take good care of her!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Okay!" Hesklaus agreed without hesitation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lilrias looked up at the two of them blankly. He was just playing with the statue and didn't know what was going on.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, a young man ran over: "Father, why did you call me here?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You came just in time." Saustatus waved to him: "This is Uncle Heskraus, my cooperation Partner."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Hello, Uncle Hesklaus!" The young man immediately came forward to say hello politely.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, Sostatus pointed at him and introduced: "This is my second son Sosikles."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Heskraus was a little embarrassed because he had not specially prepared gifts for the children of Sostatus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course Saustatus didn't care about this. He pointed to the son of Heskraus and said: "This is your uncle's son Lyrias. He will stay at home for a while. As the young master, you have to be responsible." Take good care of her and let him have fun in Thurii, do you understand?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Understood, father." Sosikles stepped forward and quickly pulled Lyrias and ran into the inner courtyard together.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Sir, this... is really troublesome for you!" Heskraus said with some emotion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I have three children. One of them got sick and died when he was young..." Saustatus casually chatted about his family life: "There are only two sons left. The eldest was influenced by his brother-in-law. , unwilling to do business, willing to be a soldier, and now serves as an officer in the Border Corps stationed in Thessaly (there was a riot in the Border Corps in the Po River area, and the Ministry of Military Affairs learned a lesson and stipulated: the Border Corps was divided into Officers above the captain and squad leader must be regular Theonian officers to ensure the entire legion's absolute loyalty to the kingdom). I went to Thessaly 4 years ago mainly to visit him, and Hades blessed me. , let me discover you, a very capable businessman..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   My lord, you have given me a reward." Heskraus was a little embarrassed, but of course he didn't know that Saustatus went to Thessaly that year. Visiting his son is only one of the reasons. The important thing is to open up business channels between Thessaly and Theonia, because Hieros is his brother-in-law, and he has some convenience in doing things in Thessaly. He met the pottery of Hesklaus. Shang was just a coincidence. Although he did have some abilities, what Saustatus valued more at that time was his origin, because he was a Peleus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "...So I have no choice but to place my hopes on Sosikles, hoping that he can inherit my family business in the future..." Sostatus said, and took Heskraus into the restaurant in the front yard. , this restaurant is very large, with many tables set up, but there are only a few people chatting.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Come, let me introduce you." Saustatus said with a smile: "This is Heskraus from Thessaly! This is Iscalas from Messenia! This is This is Ionidas from New Sparta! This is Andokides from the Arcadian League!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Saustatus finished introducing, the four people immediately discovered the difference between them. What they have in common: all come from the regions and allies that joined Theonia after the Greek War. They are all newcomers to the huge business network established by Sostatus. No wonder they came so early and immediately felt a sense of intimacy. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just as everyone was shaking hands and saying hello, Saustatus's trusted servant hurried in and whispered a few words in his master's ear. Saustatus immediately said goodbye and left, striding towards the courtyard gate.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, his housekeeper had already respectfully welcomed in an old man who was thin but energetic.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lord Theos, I didn't expect you to be the first distinguished guest to arrive!" Saustatus smiled so much that his whole fat face seemed to be blooming: "Welcome, your arrival makes me glow. Ah!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "As a businessman, the most important thing is to be punctual and trustworthy." Theos said seriously: "If you agree to arrive at dusk, you should arrive at dusk. Anyone who is late at night should be fined with alcohol!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Sir Theos I will definitely carry out the order given by you!" Saustatus said with a smile: "The banquet will not end if the latecomers are not allowed to drink down tonight! But Lord Laos, shouldn't you also be allowed to drink? Are you being fined for drinking?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I came so early, why should I be fined for drinking?" Theos pretended to be confused.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your son Axikus married Princess Ivia. This is a great joy!" Saustatus said angrily: "You actually held the wedding quietly and didn't hold a banquet to invite us. To celebrate, even during this period of time, you can't come out to see people. Is it because you are now His Majesty's relative and feel that your status is high, so you look down on us old brothers!" "Don't
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   talk nonsense! I made it clear to you last time. It's not that I don't want to celebrate. It's because neither Princess Agnes nor Princess Ivia want to make the wedding a fuss. That's why His Majesty specifically gave me instructions to do that. . I was also very depressed. After they attended the Marriage Festival, they hid directly in the palace. When the wedding was held on the Hill of Kings, only our family was allowed to go up there. Many of my relatives are still here. Blame me!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Hahaha..." Saustatus smiled heartily and said: "I heard that Princess Agnes and Princess Aviya are both very quiet people, so it is impossible to make such an arrangement. Strange. But Princess Aviya is beautiful and virtuous. Many young talents in the kingdom want to marry her. In the end, your son succeeded. This fully proves that Axikus is very good!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Theos was very proud in his heart and said But he said modestly: "It can't be said to be outstanding, it's just that he happened to be hit by Eros' golden arrow. Princess Aviya is the director of the zoo, and Axikus also likes animals. You know how animals are kept in the zoo?" The iron cages are all made by my iron workshop. Every time I want to build an iron cage, Axikus personally takes people to the site to survey and make... This way for a long time, when Axikus When Si suddenly told me that he was going to marry Aviya, I was shocked. I had no idea how they got along well?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Okay, Sir Theos, don't be proud! Tonight's The banquet is just for us, old friends, to celebrate you. You have to get drunk before you can go home!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Okay!" Theos nodded simply: "But you also have to get drunk with me!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Why?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Because You also have a happy event to celebrate!" Theos blinked: "Don't think I don't know, your brother Dikaokrat has become the commander of the army!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What a happy event this is." Sostatu Si disapproved: "There are dozens of legion commanders in the whole kingdom. My brother has only become the legion commander at this age. It is nothing at all."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The legion commander is nothing, but becoming the legion commander of a veteran is nothing." Theo Si said calmly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "He has just become the commander of the legion. It is impossible to be elected as a senator in a short period of time. There are many legion commanders in front of him..." Saustatus did not hold out hope for this, although now the rights of the senator have been It is not as good as before, but it is still noble, and it also has the power to select auxiliary ministers, select regional chief executives, listen to and evaluate the performance reports of local officials... It is also the main force for the Kingdom Assembly to revise and formulate laws at the beginning of each year, so no matter Whether it is administrative officials or military generals who are still eager to enter the Senate.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As Saustatus was talking, something suddenly occurred to him. He looked at Theos with a mysterious smile on his face and asked in a low voice: "Do you have any inside information?"
