   Chapter 1135 The Battle of Leuctra
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I understand, I will go back to discuss with others and strive for more benefits for the kingdom on the covenant..." Ansitanos responded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "And..." Davos hesitated and said, "About your resignation as Foreign Secretary, do you want to reconsider it? Seeing that a war may be about to start again, and it is in the complicated Greece. In the mainland, foreign affairs are the top priority, and we need an experienced minister like you to take the helm. How can you leave at this critical time?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ansitanos stretched out his skinny fingers and touched the gray hair on his head. Hair, said: "Your Majesty, I am old and do not have enough energy to cope with such a heavy task, especially when a war is about to happen. It is better to resign from the post of Foreign Minister and seize the remaining time to do something you like to do. Things, such as quickly writing the "History of the Kingdom of Theonia in the First 20 Years"."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Okay..." Davos didn't force it anymore, thought about it, and then said: "I read the diplomacy you listed. After considering the choice of minister for a long time, I feel that Tapirus is more suitable. He has made great contributions in the Western Mediterranean War and the Gallic War. Both his qualifications and ability are sufficient. What do you think?" "Your
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Majesty's decision. , I completely agree." Ansitanos replied without hesitation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Then after the alliance with Thebes is signed, I will summon the six auxiliary ministers to finalize this matter." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Yes, Your Majesty."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Henny, send your teacher off for me. ."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Teacher, how much has been written about your "History of the Kingdom of Theonia in the First 20 Years"? It would be best to publish it at the same time as my "War in the Western Mediterranean" so that readers can compare each other. Being detailed and brief will help them understand the history of that period..." Henipolis kept talking non-stop on the way to see Ansitanos off.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ansitanos listened quietly and occasionally responded. It was not until he walked out of the palace that he said seriously: "Henipolis, you should pay attention to the tone of your words to His Majesty in the future. It is best not to be so casual again. !"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I have always spoken to His Majesty like this. Is there any problem?" Henipolis was a little confused.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty is no longer the same as before. Not only does he have unprecedented prestige in the kingdom, but he also has greater power!..." Ansitanos whispered with emotion, and the scene just now was still in his mind: he had recommended a total of Three of the four candidates for Foreign Secretary were his students. Their qualifications and achievements were not inferior to Tapirus, but Davos chose Tapirus, who was not so closely related to him.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A few years ago, important personnel appointments such as the Kingdom's Minister of Foreign Affairs usually had to be discussed by the ministers and finally submitted to the Senate for approval. But now it only requires His Majesty and the six auxiliary ministers to discuss, and the decision can be roughly made. Basically, it's all decided by Davos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Teacher, Your Majesty is the same as before. There is no difference. It is you who think too much." Henipolis had a different view on this, and in turn comforted Ansitanos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ansitanos could only say helplessly: "It seems that I am really old, and I always like to think wildly..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The "Kalias Contract" was signed After that, according to the contract, the contracting parties must recall their troops stationed abroad and dismantle military fortresses in foreign countries.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, Athens was recalling the army led by Iphicrates stationed in Corcyra, but Sparta did not implement the contract. On the contrary, after learning that "Thebes sent an envoy to Theonia", Sparta The masters had an even greater sense of urgency. They wanted to send the envoy Xenophon to Theonia again to persuade King Davos not to provide support to the Thebans, but the Persian envoy Datis, who had never left, warned The Spartans were not allowed to have close contact with Theonia, and also said: In order to support Sparta in punishing Thebes, a large amount of supplies given to Sparta by Persia are being carried by the Miletus fleet and will soon be arrival.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In such a situation, Sparta decided to launch an attack on Thebes first.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This time the Spartans gathered the alliance army more quickly than ever before. Due to Agesilaus's illness, the army was still commanded by Cleombrotus, another Spartan king. Before the contract was signed, he had He was ordered to be stationed in Phokis, and the reinforcements led his troops across the Gulf of Corinth in May to join him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, the news that "Theonia and Thebes have formed an alliance" has reached Sparta, making the Spartans feel nervous.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Subsequently, Tapirus, the envoy of Theonia, also came to Sparta and reminded the Council of Elders: Theonia has formed an alliance with Thebes, hoping that Sparta can cease war with Thebes, restore peace, and avoid Theonia had to be involved in the war because of the alliance, thus destroying the friendship between Theonia and Sparta for more than 10 years.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The elders headed by Agesilaus stated that Sparta did not know that Theonia had formed an alliance with Thebes before, so the army had already set off and might even have fought against Thebes.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Under such circumstances, it will be difficult to withdraw the troops in a short time, but they will do their best to restore peace to Greece.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tapirus saw the perfunctory behavior of the Spartans, but his trip was just to make a notice in accordance with traditional etiquette. King Davos did not ask him to prevent the war from happening, so Tapirus quickly left. On the way out of the city, he encountered the Persian envoy Datis and was threatened and ridiculed by him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing that most of the Spartans were on the side of the Persian envoy, and the enemy was outnumbered, Tapirus did not fully refute. After a few words, he left in embarrassment, but he kept this humiliation in his heart.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In mid-June, Cleombrotus stationed his troops at Cronia, the gateway to Phocis and Boeotia, and waited for subsequent reinforcements to arrive before immediately marching towards Thebes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now all the people in Greece believe that the decisive battle between Thebes and Sparta is inevitable, and Sparta's huge military strength makes them believe that Sparta has an absolute advantage, and then they just wait for Thebes to be defeated. It's a good idea to completely destroy or become a puppet controlled by Sparta.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even many Thebans had no hope of victory, and even suggested with a sad face: surrender to Sparta.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Some city-states, such as Athens, rejoiced in the impending disaster of Thebes; some city-states, such as Argos, felt sorry for Thebes and silently prayed for Thebes; and a few city-states extended a helping hand to Thebes at this time, the most famous of which was None other than Tagus Jason of Thessaly, who had quietly formed an alliance with Thebes a year ago, and at this critical moment, transported 300 Thessalonians to Thebes by sea. Li cavalry (because the land route of Thermopylae was controlled by Sparta, it was impossible for the Thessalians to go south through it).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In early July, Cleombrotus unexpectedly allowed the army to quickly pass through a narrow path in the mountains, avoiding the ambush of the Theban coalition forces, arrived at Thisbe, and raided the only seaport occupied by Thebes-Cliu. The Sith captured the few warships in Thebes, thus ensuring the safety of their retreat.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After resting for two days, the Spartan coalition with more than 10,000 soldiers marched directly to Thebes in the north.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When they reached the heights of Leuctra, the Spartans found that the road ahead had been blocked by the Theban army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Originally, when the Spartan coalition entered the territory of Boiosia, many Theban generals believed that the Spartan coalition was coming this time with great force and its numbers were much larger than before, so they could not face the enemy head-on, so they suggested to temporarily avoid its edge. , abandoned the outer military fortresses and retreated to the city of Thebes for defense.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, Epamilonda firmly opposed it. He firmly believed that the enemy should be proactively attacked and the Spartans should not be allowed to invade the core area of ​​Thebes. Otherwise, letting them try to destroy farmland and villages would shake the citizens' desire to fight. determination.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because Ipamilonda led the Thebans to successfully resist the invasion of the Spartan coalition in these years, he had a high reputation among the citizens, and he had been elected as the military governor of the Boeotian Alliance at this time. (The highest position in the Boeotian League is elected once a year, two at a time, the other is Pelopidas), and Pelopidas, who has returned to the city of Thebes, fully supports Ipamilonda's decision, so the Boeotian alliance headed by Thebes finally decided to fight to the death with the Spartan coalition.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ipamilonda led the Boeotian coalition, which totaled about 6,000 troops, and arrived at the Leuctra Highlands early, waiting for the arrival of the enemy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Leuctra Highlands is located at the southern end of the plain where Thebes is located. It is full of low hills. Among them, there is a relatively flat rounded top. It is where the Theban commanders and main generals are located, and it is also where the heavy infantry is gathered. land.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Ipamilonda learned that the Spartan coalition had arrived, he did not immediately start to form a formation and assume a battle posture. Instead, he moved his army to the hill opposite the Spartan coalition settlement and began to build a camp.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, some Theban generals suggested to Ipamilonda that they should launch an attack on the Spartans when they had just marched here and the veterans were tired.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ipamilonda did not adopt it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the second day, the Spartans still did not take military action, but Cleombrotus had learned through sentries that the number of Boeotian coalition forces in the opposite camp was significantly smaller than his own, which finally prompted him to attack on the third day. Early in the morning, he led the fully rested Spartan coalition out of the camp and began to form a formation along the gentle hillside.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Ipamilonda learned the news, he immediately rushed outside the camp, looked at the opposite hill, and then smiled: because the formation of the Spartan coalition forces did not change much from the battle formations that the Spartans participated in in the past. , the army was still lined up, with the Spartan warriors wearing red cloaks on the right wing and protruding from the entire array.
