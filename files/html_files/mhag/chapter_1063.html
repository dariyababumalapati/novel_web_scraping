   Chapter 1063 Etruria's request for help
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes... Your Majesty..." Publius choked with sobs and nodded repeatedly, determined in his heart: after this matter is over, Lentulus must be allowed to leave Turii and go to a town where no Romans live to endure hardships. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos smiled kindly and raised his glass again: "Come on, have a drink. Once you handle this matter smoothly, I think you can also successfully serve as the town administrator."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing this, Publius became energetic. He drank the wine in his glass in one gulp and said decisively: "Your Majesty, please rest assured, I will catch them all and never let anyone escape!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Under the guidance of the palace etiquette officer, Guliala stood at the entrance of the Theonia Palace Hall and heard a shout from inside: "Guriala, the envoy of the Etruscan Alliance, asks to see you!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then he heard a majestic voice saying: "Let him come in."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Guriala's heart began to feel nervous. He took a deep breath and walked into the palace hall.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The tall and spacious hall was illuminated exceptionally brightly by the sunlight coming from the side windows. Tall and mighty soldiers stood straight on both sides, their armors shining brightly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Guliara walked forward among the corridors formed by the guards, and then saw a row of black wooden chairs on the left and right sides, with more than a dozen Theonian officials wearing gorgeous robes sitting on them, most of them with inquiring eyes. Looking at himself with his eyes, among them was the Theonian Foreign Minister Ansitanos whom he knew well.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The gentle old man smiled and nodded to Guliala, which made him feel calmer. Then he saw the man sitting on the throne directly in front of him. The crown on his head was bright and dazzling, and his face was solemn. He couldn't help but feel sad. It's a matter of urgency: This is King Davos who destroyed Rome, conquered Carthage, and made Dionysia the sole overlord of the Western Mediterranean.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He quickly bent down and saluted respectfully: "Your Majesty, the most noble King Davos, on behalf of all the people of the Etruscan Union, I extend my most respectful greetings to you!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Welcome, envoy of the Etruscan Alliance!" Davos smiled and said kindly: "The Etruscan Alliance is an alliance of Theonia. In recent years, not only have we had frequent trade, but we have also There are also a lot of cultural exchanges, and this trend is very good. I hope that our exchanges will become closer and closer, which will be beneficial to the stability of central Italy!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty the King, you are right!" Guriala took over and said: "But our Etruscan city-state hopes to strengthen exchanges with the Kingdom of Theonia not only in trade and culture, but also in military affairs. It also strengthens connections.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Antaoris, the rotating chairman of the Senate, immediately interjected: "Messenger Guriala, your words are confusing. You should know that Theonia and Etrunia are allies. The covenant originally stipulated that the two sides will be in trade and culture. There are no restrictions on our exchanges, and once one party is in trouble, the other party must provide military assistance, which shows that we have deep military ties."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "That is only an emergency measure under special circumstances, and what I said about strengthening military ties is that our Etruscan Alliance hopes to get military help from your Kingdom of Theonia under normal circumstances! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Guliara said in a heavy tone: "Your Majesty the King, you should know that over the years, the Gauls (Greeks), the neighbors to the north of the Etruscan Union, have always brought these ferocious and terrifying barbaric races to the north of the peninsula and from the depths of the continent. They were collectively called Celts, and the Theonians initially continued this statement. It was not until Rome was incorporated into the kingdom that, under their influence, they gradually began to rename the Celts in northern Italy as Gauls). It is constantly invading the territory of the Etruscan Alliance, and the intensity of its invasion has continued to intensify in the past two years. The alliance formed an army for defense, but..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Guliala showed an angry and worried look: "The northern border is too broad, and the Gauls are very cunning. They rarely fight against our assembled coalition forces, but always attack our small and isolated troops and invade our defenseless areas. region... The alliance is now somewhat overwhelmed, and people from several city-states near the northern border are fleeing south in large numbers... If this continues, the Gauls will be able to occupy Luna, Luca and Fernando in the north. Florentia, and then allow more tribes to easily cross the rugged mountainous areas and take root in the northern part of our Etruscan Union territory. By then...the Gaul battle more than 20 years ago I am afraid that the large-scale invasion of the south by humans will happen again!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this point, the ministers in the palace whispered for a while, but no one took the initiative to speak.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos avoided Guriala's pleading eyes and looked at Alexis, the Minister of Military Affairs (the former Minister of Military Affairs, Hilos, had resigned two years ago, and Davos personally appointed Alexis, who had made great contributions in the Western Mediterranean War, to be his replacement). , asked softly: "Alexis, what do you think of this?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alexis frowned, thought for a while, and then said solemnly: "I heard what the Etruscan envoy said, the situation in the northern part of the Etruscan Union is more serious! But... now the Gauls are not There is no large-scale invasion of the south, nor the capture of city-states on the northern border. If we, Theonia, agree to the request of the Etruscan Alliance and send reinforcements to reinforce their northern border, we will probably also encounter the difficulties they face. ...The Gauls will refuse to fight us head-on and continue to disperse their armies to harass Etruria, but it is impossible for us to gather a large army to invade the territory of the Gauls...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   To effectively defend against the Gallic invasion will inevitably require a long period of confrontation and fierce fighting, and our reinforcements cannot stay in friendly territories far away from home for a long time. This will make the soldiers unable to handle their own affairs and affect their income... …Moreover, if the reinforcements stay in the north for a long time, they will also consume a lot of food in the Etruscan city-state and usher in complaints from the local people..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, Lord Alexis is right. Sending reinforcements at this time will be detrimental to both Etruria and our Theonia. We should consider it more carefully..." Most ministers They all agreed, obviously not agreeing with the "reinforcement of Etruria".
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Guliala was a little panicked, but fortunately he was prepared in advance: "Well... we also think that it is not appropriate to ask Theonia to send reinforcements at this time... so the top leaders of the alliance city-states unanimously decided after many discussions, Luna, Lucca, and Florentia will allocate part of the territory to Theonia. You can build towns in these territories. The cost of building the city and the short-term material consumption will be borne by the entire Etruscan Union. Provided free of charge.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as these words came out, there was an uproar around him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agriculture Minister Burkos couldn't help but ask: "You mean...these set aside lands will always belong to Theonia?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, always!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "So how much land is there? In addition to building towns, is there enough leftover land to support the people in the towns?" Burkos then asked, and also reminded: "If there is not enough land to allocate to Dio As a share of the citizens of Nia, even if His Majesty agrees to your request, the people of the kingdom may not be willing to move to the Etruscan region, after all, living there is much more dangerous than at home!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Guriala felt hope and immediately said solemnly: "Of course the Etruscan Alliance has considered this issue, so please rest assured that the land provided by the Alliance is vast enough and fertile, and should be able to satisfy the people of Theonia. requirements, and there are even rich mineral resources in some places..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Guriala's words immediately aroused heated discussion among the ministers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This situation made Guliala sigh in his heart: If it weren't for the perennial plundering and harassment of the Gauls, which caused a large number of people in the city-states near the northern border to flee south, leaving the land of these city-states desolate and depopulated, they would not have Might offer so much land to Dioria!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Alexis asked again: "Etruscan envoy, do we, Theonia, have the right to actively choose which lands are assigned to Theonia? Where to build a city?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As the highest military officer in the kingdom, Alexis asked this question because he did not want the Etruscans to assign all the land closest to the Gauls to Theonia, and let Theonia The citizen soldiers were at the forefront, defending against the Gauls' attack and bearing the casualties alone, while the Etruscans hid behind and did nothing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before Guriala responded, Davos coughed slightly and said seriously: "I am also more concerned about this issue."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Guliala's heart trembled, knowing that he could not be perfunctory on this issue. He raised his spirits and said after careful consideration: "Dear King... The Kingdom of Theonia is powerful and the Etruscan Alliance is relatively weak. How can we play with it? Scheming, we sincerely provide the land, please help us to resist the Gauls! If His Majesty the King and the ministers are not satisfied with the assigned land, we can also discuss it again and choose new land."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos was satisfied with his statement. He leaned back, held the armrests of the throne with both hands, and said with a smile: "I already know the requirements of the Etruscan Alliance. Please go back first." Rest and we will discuss this.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "...Yes, Your Majesty the King!" Guliala did not receive a clear reply. Although he felt a little unwilling, he did not dare to say any more and bowed out of the palace respectfully.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Davos looked at the ministers and said loudly: "Everyone, you have heard the request of the Etruscan envoy. If you have any opinions on this, please tell me."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
