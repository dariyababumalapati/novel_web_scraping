   Chapter 1084 The frustrated Maximus
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   was also nervous about the kingdom's comments on his death, especially after his will was announced "to donate most of his inheritance to the kingdom", and there were no more senators. What was the objection: the statue was placed in the Panth√©on, and a statue of him in front of the Finance Department was also approved.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even the opening of the Congress of Greek Scholars was postponed a few days for his funeral.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A few days later, the Senate once again released an important news: Haka, the only governor of the Kingdom of Theonia who had served for more than 4 years, resigned, and the senator Bagule took over as the governor of southern Iberia. The Senate added the position of rotating president, and Haka took over after being transferred back to Thurii.

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Important changes in the political arena of the Kingdom of Theonia do not attract much attention from ordinary people. The hottest thing discussed in the streets of cities in the kingdom today is: whether the citizens of Theonia should pay more taxes to increase the kingdom's military expenditures. , to solve border security issues.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   From the very beginning of the fierce debate (most of the registered freedmen and preparatory citizens supported paying more taxes, while the vast majority of citizens expressed opposition), many citizens began to believe that "as long as they can be spared the pain of long-term border guarding, "It's worth paying more taxes", and now the main topic of debate among the people has become "how much more taxes should be paid". This entire evolution process has only gone through a dozen days.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Such rapid changes are, on the one hand, the result of the full promotion of the intelligence agencies, and the other main reason is that the vast majority of citizens are the first generation citizens of the Kingdom of Theonia, and they are all in the process of the establishment and rise of this kingdom. Participants and founders, they used their sweat and spears to promote the growth of the Kingdom of Theonia. At the same time, under the long-term influence of Theonia law and the Temple of Hades, a strong feeling was created in their hearts. With a sense of ownership, when the kingdom does encounter difficulties and they need to sacrifice a little of their own interests and provide help, they can finally make reasonable choices.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the street tavern, the diners were still arguing fiercely: "I hope the direct tax paid by the citizens should be 15%. Since the people of traditional Greek city-states like Athens, Corinth, Thebes... can all contribute to the city-state's It is in the public interest to pay such a high tax, and some tax rates are even higher than this. The citizens of Theonia, known as the 'most patriotic', own a large amount of land and should accept this tax rate calmly."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " 15% is a bit high, and it used to be only 1%, but now it suddenly has to be 15%. This change is too big, and I think many people can't stand it. Seven or eight percent should be more reasonable." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I say to you. I am so happy to discuss the issue of paying taxes here. Have you ever considered that if formal citizens have to increase the tax, we will also increase the same tax!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I am single, no matter how much tax I pay, I can make do with my life, for the time being. I
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   don't have the worries of starting a family, so I don't worry about it."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Of course I have considered this issue. I think the more taxes we pay, the richer the kingdom will be, which is more beneficial to us free people and prepared citizens, because the kingdom has paid military expenditures. After that, we can use more spare money to build better public facilities, purchase more food to stabilize food prices, and subsidize hospitals to reduce medical fees... And the benefits we receive from these are greater than those of formal citizens. After all, they are already rich enough and don't care much."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "That makes sense, so I decided to change my mind and support a 15% tax."

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A group of people were chatting happily when they suddenly heard the cook shouting: "Marcy Maximus, you're here!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Ah..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "How about a glass of beer?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The diners looked over immediately, and the interested person immediately asked: "Maximus, you are going to find a job today, what's the situation? How?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I asked you whether you are stupid. Do you even need to ask? You can tell by the look on his face that he didn't succeed."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus squeezed out a bitter smile and tried his best to explain: "Actually, during the interview , the person in charge of the library was already willing to hire me as a scribe, but the person next to him said a few more words. After knowing that I was... a Roman emancipated slave, he hesitated and said to me, 'If I come in a few days Come again in a month, and when the incident subsides, he will definitely hire me." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I said Maximus, don't blame the officials of Thurii for not hiring you. The Roman conspiracy to rebel is not over yet. Wanting to assassinate the great King Davos is a big deal! Thurii City Hall is so close to the Senate and the Royal Palace. What if... I mean what if, they really hired you? If you cause trouble again, they will all be implicated, so to be on the safe side, of course they dare not take the risk of hiring you. That person said nicely, 'a few months later'... Haha, I see the Turiyi Municipal Government The restaurant may not dare to hire Romans again within one or two years!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The diner's words made Maximus' face instantly turn ugly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Don't talk nonsense." Another diner comforted: "Maximus, don't listen to him. The matter is not that serious. Everyone knows that His Majesty Davos always treats all races in the kingdom equally and will never allow it. This kind of thing happens, so this kind of thing is only temporary, and you don't even have to wait until a few months later. Just watch, it will get better soon, because the new chief executive of Thurii will take office soon, and Man Lilius Publius, he is a real Roman, how could he allow the city hall to discriminate against his compatriots like
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   this!" "You don't understand!" a previous diner retorted: " The appointment of Publius as the administrator of Thurii was already very controversial. In order to avoid suspicion and safety, on the contrary, he was likely to strictly control the Romans in the city of Thurii in the early days of his reign..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus listened. As I watched, I felt more and more uneasy: because the assassination of Davos also involved Publius' eldest son, whether he knew it was him who reported it or not, the previous collegiality must have been destroyed. Not only I can't go to him for help, I'm afraid I have to avoid him. It seems that I can't go to the Turiyi City Hall, and I don't want to go back to the slave camp. Do I really want to go to the Turiyi port to find something to do?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But in this way, the chances of shortening the period of becoming a formal citizen as soon as possible will be much less..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maximus was thinking painfully when another diner sighed: "These damn Romans!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Oh, Maximus, I'm not talking about you... They caused such a big thing, which resulted in the security protection of this year's Scholars Conference being much stricter than in previous years. As our identities, we want to freely enter and exit the academy and listen to the scholars' speeches. It's much more difficult.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What's so good about those speeches? We don't understand. Instead of sitting there, we might as well use this time to earn more money and come here to buy a few more drinks!"
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   That's right! "
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   That's right!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You don't understand. I can't understand most of the speeches of the scholars, but you can see some famous people at this conference that you rarely see, such as Elder Ansitanos and Matiklis. Elder...wait, of course, there is also our great King Davos. Many of you have probably never seen our king in person, but I can see it every year. If I am lucky, I can even enter him. Listening to his speech at a close distance in the venue, it was really..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This diner looked intoxicated, which made others feel a little itchy. Someone asked eagerly: "Tell us, His Majesty the King. What do you talk about at a conference of scholars?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Well... this... His Majesty the King is a descendant of Hades, the god of heaven. He has been inspired by the gods. Privately, some scholars call him the omniscient. His speech is so profound, I How can I remember it? I just remember that before the speech, he very humbly thanked everyone for coming to listen to his speech..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Isn't this the beginning of all speeches in our kingdom? How could it be possible for His Majesty the Great King to say this? Like them, I think you are just bragging. In fact, you have never listened to His Majesty's speech!" One diner questioned, and others also booed. They were dissatisfied with this man's smugness and took the opportunity to boo.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The diner was anxious: "Of course I have listened to His Majesty's speech! I tell you...I...I tell you...a very interesting thing happened at this year's Scholars Conference! Not only did His Majesty the King give a speech, And Prince Apox also came on stage to give a speech - "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Prince Apox? I remember that he is the second son of His Majesty Davos. He should not be 18 years old this year." A diner obviously expressed this. Suspect.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You don't know. Although Apox is still underage, he is a descendant of Hades. He is favored by the gods. He has been very smart since he was a child. Not only did he graduate from Thurii School ahead of schedule, it is said that Theonia Various colleges in the academy scrambled to get him to study in their own college, and they fought over it. As a result, Apox became an official student of the School of Mathematics and the School of Letters at the same time. This was something that had never happened since the establishment of Theonia College. !" The diner said arrogantly: "He has been studying in the academy for several years. Now he can give a speech and express his own opinions at the scholar conference. Is it so strange?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   We are just a little curious... After all, you are young..." the diner who had questioned before said sarcastically.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing that the other party had surrendered, the diner did not pursue the victory, but expressed his understanding: "Actually, not only you think so, but also some scholars at the venue, including several from the Pythagorean School of Tarantum. They also tried to make things difficult for Prince Apox, but despite his young age, Prince Apox was very eloquent. He quickly rendered the Tarantum people speechless, and finally everyone in the audience was speechless. Cheer for him! You haven't seen the dejected look of the people of Tarentum, it's really refreshing!"
