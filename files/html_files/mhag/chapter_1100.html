   Chapter 1100: Selection of the Regional Chief Executive (4)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A senator once asked him, and his answer was: "I study mathematics, and any formulas and theorems must be calculated personally to determine whether they are correct. And for me, We don't know much about everyone's political achievements. If you don't understand, you can't make random recommendations, otherwise it will mislead everyone and affect state affairs..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But now that he stood up, the elders were inevitably curious about who he wanted to recommend.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Nikomachus is the person I want to recommend! I won't say much about Nicomachus' ability. The fact that his statue is erected in the city of Aldrum speaks for itself. What I want to say is that in During the Western Mediterranean War, he responded to His Majesty's call and resolutely went to the Latium region to assist Master Asistes in reorganizing the newly captured Rome. Later, he worked hard to manage the city of Gabi that was ravaged by the war..." When Mentotic Els said the word "washed by war", he specially emphasized the tone, because after the city of Gabi was captured, all the people were demoted as slaves, in order to frighten other Latin city-states. , Mentotic Els has some opinions on this approach.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos, who was sitting in the center of the venue, still looked calm and seemed not to hear his words.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "...So I think Nicomachus should definitely become the regional administrator and contribute more to the kingdom."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mentotic Els's words made Sedorum feel that something was wrong. The taste in these words Why was it similar to what Brem said? He suddenly looked at Davos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not only him, but also Hermon and Lysias. Of course, they would not see anything strange from Davos's calm face.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After this round of recommendations, some elders began to raise objections: "Lord Kesima does understand the situation in the Samonai Mountains, but to serve as the administrator of the eastern Campania region, it is not just about maintaining this region. The stability of the country should allow this area to develop better, so that it can better assimilate the surrounding Samoni people. In this regard, Lord Kesima does not seem to have performed very well in his past resume... "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lord Hegesitus does have a rich resume, but he has no experience in working in northern towns. I'm afraid he doesn't know much about the Samnites..." The
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   recommender must answer these questions one by one to avoid doubts. Have a bad impact on the people you recommend.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After some debate, the vote was cast - Nick Marcus narrowly won.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Nicomachus stood up with a look of disbelief on his face and bowed in all directions to express his gratitude. His exaggerated funny actions and humorous language caused laughter in the venue and eased the gradually tense atmosphere.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The next thing to be recommended is the Strait of Messina region." The
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Strait of Messina region includes Ligium, Messina, Taurina, some small towns on the north coast of Sicily, and the Lipara Islands. Although this area is narrow, , the population is not large, but it has the Strait of Messina with great strategic and trade value, so it is recommended by many people.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There was one person who stood out among them - Sipulos. As the rotating chairman, he actually stood up and recommended himself, which naturally caused a small commotion in the audience, and the candidate he recommended was Amycles.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Perhaps other elders would think that Sipulos had been the administrator of Catanai and Amycles had been the administrator of Messina. The two had worked together in eastern Sicily for several years and must have a good relationship, so they took the initiative to recommend them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But Davos knew through the intelligence department that Sipulos did not have much contact with Amycles. He made the recommendation regardless of the interests, probably out of public interest.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is what he admires most about Sipulos.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the two years since Sipulos became the rotating chairman, his suggestions to Davos were all based on the interests of the kingdom, with almost no selfish motives, unlike Sedorum and Hermon who considered their own race. too much.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Lysias was better, as the head of the rotating presidency, he did not do enough.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Antaoris is also good, he has a good sense of the overall situation, but sometimes he is a bit impatient. I wonder if he will have anyone to recommend today?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ...Davos' eyes paused for a moment on Antaoris, and then turned to look at Amycles in the venue. This senator from Castellon seemed a little surprised and nervous, maybe because he didn't. It was expected that Sipulos would recommend him, but he also had expectations for this position. However, his previous failure in running for the chief executive of the eastern region of Campania made him worry about gains and losses.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So is Amycles suitable to be the administrator of the Strait of Messina region?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ...Davos thought about it, and really felt that he was a suitable candidate: It seemed that Amycles was a person with a gentle personality and not strong enough. When he was the chief general of Castellon, he succumbed to Dai Vos. Onia's strength, when he was the administrator of Messina, he took the initiative to be humble to the administrator Lijim with a tough personality; when he was the administrator of Gela, he faced the cold-hearted leader Sikel. I took the initiative to go to the mountains to negotiate with him for the first time...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But looking at it on the other hand, this is not a kind of wisdom in doing things!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, during the years when wars broke out frequently in Magna Graecia, Castellon was not affected by too many wars, and in the end the people happily joined the kingdom.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Look at the ongoing conflicts between Ligem and Messina today, but the years when Amicles was in office were a period of relatively good relations between the two cities.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is also precisely because of Amycles's approach that many Sikelians took the initiative to move to the sparsely populated Gela, making Gela the fastest post-war recovery among the towns on the south coast of Sicily...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What a fool!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ...Davos looked at the ordinary-looking old man in the crowd, and he gradually felt a little hopeful: Maybe he could really resolve the decades-long feud between Lijim and Messina!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thinking of this, he turned his attention to Commerce Secretary Mariji, who was on the right side of the front row of the venue. The two made eye contact and then quickly looked away.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After reporting two more candidates, Midorades, the commander of the Second Fleet, stood up and said loudly: "I also recommend Amycles. Although I didn't have much contact with him, when the Third Fleet went south to I received his full support and help when fighting on the north coast of Sicily. I feel that he is a good administrator, so I recommend him."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   These words were simple and rude, but no one found it funny, because Midorades is now a member of the kingdom. A popular hero who has made outstanding achievements in the Western Mediterranean War, his support will undoubtedly greatly increase the possibility of Amycles being selected.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, some senators were reluctant to mention: "Amicles once served as the administrator of Messina. If he is appointed as the administrator of the Isthmian region this time, serving too long a term in the same region will violate the law on the term of office of Theonian officials. ."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sipulos was well prepared for this, and he explained calmly: "Lord Amiklis only served in Messina for 4 years, and then was transferred to the chief executive of Gela. If he wins, there will be no Exceeding the rule of not serving more than 8 years in the same region."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sipulos easily refuted the doubts, which also made Milon feel the same: if he had not discussed with Lysias in advance, got his reminder, and prepared, I am afraid that he would have encountered big trouble today, resulting in a failure.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The final result of the vote was that Amycles won by only 5 votes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Amicles obviously did not expect such a result. He stood up a little confused after being struck by luck. When saluting the applauding senators, he also specially bowed to Siplos and Midorades. Thank you individually.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Many senators were secretly sighing: The coward Amycles was so lucky to be favored by Siplos and Midorades.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But they obviously didn't realize that the real behind-the-scenes person was sitting in the center of the venue like a wood carving and clay sculpture.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The next place to be recommended is the Catania region!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Antaoris's words made Milon sit up straight. He knew that Lysias's cautious character would not directly recommend him, so he was very cautious. Wonder who Lysias will ask to come forward.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But the first senator who stood up had nothing to do with Lysias. He was Alcibiadas, the brother of Princess Agnes and a relative of King Davos. Although he had such a special status, he had He has not held any position in the kingdom's political arena, but his business has grown bigger and bigger, and he has become a famous big businessman in the kingdom. It is precisely because of his special relationship with Davos that he rarely participates in the election of the town chief executive. The several times were all related to Feidun.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So as soon as he stood up, the elders could guess who he was going to recommend.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Today, Alcibiadas is not as arrogant as before, and even his actions seem a bit obscene. He is avoiding the gaze of Davos.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the Ministry of Military Affairs conveyed to him what Davos said, he immediately realized that he had touched Davos's bottom line. He was very frightened. He asked his sister several times to explain to Davos how to admit his mistake. But Davos has not agreed to meet him yet.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This time he attended the Senate meeting, on the one hand, for his friends, and on the other hand, he also wanted to find an opportunity to meet Davos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But when he stood up from the venue and saw the expressionless Davos in front of him, he couldn't help but feel flustered: "I...I recommend Feidun...As the current administrator of Katanai, Lord Feidun not only He quickly restored prosperity to Catanai, which had been devastated by the war, and he also actively helped the Sikel tribes near the western edge of the Catania plain, allowing these Sicilian mountain people who had to join the kingdom to survive the war. After a difficult time, many tribes finally took the initiative to leave the mountainous area and accept the jurisdiction of Feidun..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It seems that that sentence still had a considerable effect... Of course, Davos can tremble slightly from Alcibiades. The panic in his heart could be heard in his voice.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thanks to the other side of remembrance for the tip!
