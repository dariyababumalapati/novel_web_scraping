   Chapter 1199: Rebuilding Sparta (2)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as Crotokatax finished speaking, there was a sudden uproar in the venue. Both the Pilians and the Helots realized with excitement: Dai The Onians did not deceive them, and seemed to be really prepared to fulfill the promise made by the previous messenger when they persuaded them to come to Sparta.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So, a Piliasi representative stood up excitedly and asked first: "What do you need us Piliasi people to do?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Are you going to give us the Spartan land?! And let us do it?" Are we moving into Sparta?!" Another Piliasian representative then asked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Should we replace the Spartans, elect our own king, and let him lead us to govern the land of Lagnia?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What kind of era is this, and we still want to let a king rule!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Save Isn't our Theonia a kingdom?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Compared to the Pileasians who were arguing fiercely, the Helots, although they were also somewhat excited, seemed restrained. Under the influence of such a warm atmosphere, a Helot Representative Lao Shi finally stood up and asked hesitantly: "Sir, you let us also occupy the land here... The original owners of these lands will be very angry, and they will definitely retaliate fiercely!... They still have There are many soldiers outside, and they have many allies outside. They will form a new army and fight back. By then, we will-" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Idiot! Coward!" The asylum man who stood up first Representative Riasi pointed at him and cursed loudly: "To tell you the truth, I was recruited by the Spartans before and went to Arcadia to fight against the Theonian army led by the Lord. Sparta's Tens of thousands of troops were easily defeated. I escaped into the mountains and escaped the pursuit of the ferocious Theonian soldiers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Later, on my way back to Sparta, I encountered several Spartan defeats. Soldiers, I learned from their mouths that the main force composed of Spartan warriors was surrounded during the battle and suffered heavy losses... So I crossed the mountains and ridges, instead of returning directly to Sparta City, I quietly sneaked back to the village.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Until When the messenger you sent arrived, I was the first to respond. Because I have fought with the Spartans many times, I know very well that the Spartans have completely failed. They no longer have enough young men to fight with the great Dio. The Nian army is fighting, and it is impossible to retake your city! So I firmly believe that you are powerful enough to implement your promise, and we Piliasians are also very happy to assist you in the land of Lagnia. A new city-state was established on the island.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As for these helots... they were used to being enslaved, and they were very afraid of the Spartans. They didn't even dare to say the name 'Spartans'. They really don't deserve to sit here, I think it's better to let them continue to be slaves!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   His words finally aroused the anger of the helot representatives.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After finally seeing the hope of freedom, how could they be willing to accept slavery again? This longing for the future finally allowed them to overcome their inner fears, and they began to denounce the Spartans for their oppression and persecution, and also blamed The Piliasians were accomplices of the Spartans, and they humbly expressed their willingness to obey the command of Crotocathax and complete the various tasks assigned by him with all their strength.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The venue became extremely noisy, but Crotocatacus was happy because the enthusiasm of the Pilians and Helots had been mobilized.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He coughed several times, and then said loudly: "Everyone, please be quiet! Listen to me first!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But the crowd did not stop making noise until the soldiers who maintained order at the venue intervened, and they calmed down obediently.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax turned his attention to the Piliasi representative who had helped him a lot, and asked with interest: "What is your name?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Fonida!" The man straightened his chest and said loudly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crotokatax nodded, then looked at the other people in the venue, took a deep breath, and said loudly: "As the conqueror of this land, I represent the Kingdom of Theonia, with the sacred In the name of Hades, I declare to you that from today on, both Pileas and Helots will be free and become citizens of New Sparta, with all the rights granted by the city-state!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I Please rush back immediately and tell your compatriots that within four days Piliasis and the Helots must each select 10 people with outstanding abilities, who will become the leaders of New Sparta under the guidance of Theonia. Councilors, designate and promulgate new laws, redistribute allotments to citizens, and arrange new residences and villages...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I also ask the Pilians and Helots to each elect two highly respected people who will Become the Ombudsman, supervise any unfair behavior of these new councilors in the implementation of these plans, and report to us, and we will implement the punishment..." As
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   soon as Clotokatax finished speaking, there was a wave of excitement in the venue. Cheers broke out, especially many Helots shed tears, because at this moment they all realized: this Theonian commander was not just talking, he was really prepared to let Spar suffer for the rest of his life. The enslaved people were freed, became citizens, and could own land and rights. The days of being on tenterhooks to avoid hunting by the young Spartan warriors were finally gone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just as the Pilians were excitedly talking about the candidates for the parliamentarians and the Helots gratefully praised Theonia's kindness, Clotokatax spoke again: "Please be quiet, everyone, I have something to say! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This time, the venue quickly returned to silence.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I must remind you!" Clotokatax said with a serious expression: "I just said that both the helots and the Pileas must elect 10 members each within four days. and 2 inspectors, no more and no less, otherwise it will be regarded as disrespecting Theonia's decision and will be disqualified from participating in the formation of the new Spartan government!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone who was originally extremely excited listened to this When he said that, he was immediately dumbfounded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The helots are doing better. Although most of them fled into the mountains, they are relatively concentrated and relatively close to the city of Sparta. Now they are all descending from the mountains one after another, and they can complete the task within 4 days.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But the Piliasi people are different. They have their own villages, which are quite numerous, and they are scattered in remote corners of Lagnia, such as Ision Port near the west cape and Mino near the east cape. The seaside town of Plassiere in the central part of Asia and the east... is not only far away from each other, but also often has to cross mountains and ridges. Within 4 days, each village can only select its own candidates, but the total number of people must be exceeded, but there is no Time will bring them together again to determine the final candidate.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Sir, can you give us a few more days of grace?" Fonida begged Crotokatax, and also told them about their difficulties. Other representatives of Piriasi also agreed, and now it's their turn. The helots were gloating about his misfortune.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crotokartax, who was easy to talk to before, now had a straight face and said resolutely: "Our Theonian army has other important things and cannot stay here for too long. And to form a new Spartan government It is a big matter, related to the stability of Lagnia, and there will be a lot of things to do. Time is tight, 4 days is enough, I can't give you more time!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Fonida and others were disappointed and prepared Keep begging.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax took the opportunity and said loudly: "I have a suggestion that can solve your problem! You rush back to your own villages and notify the men over 18 years old to bring enough rations and rush to the city of Sparta. The Spartans gathered in the open-air venue where the citizens' assembly was held to jointly select qualified candidates. This is fair and saves time. If you plan to do this, I will lend you horses so that you can rush back as soon as possible.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Black Lao Shi, you can also adopt this method and select your candidates to govern Lagnia at the meeting place where the Spartans decide important affairs of the city-state. Doesn't it mean that you have become the new masters of this land? ?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax's words first received a positive response from the black teachers, and they agreed without hesitation to implement this sounding suggestion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Piliasi representatives were hesitant, but under the influence of the helots, they finally agreed. After all, the distinguished and amiable Prince Theonia patiently showed them here. He has made a series of practical plans to govern Lagnia. It is impossible that there is a conspiracy hidden in his heart to wipe out all the Piliasi people.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After everyone made their decision, they were eager to leave and rush back to inform their compatriots.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Only Fernida couldn't help but ask: "Sir, how do you deal with those Spartans?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Fernida's words stopped everyone who was anxious to go out.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax said calmly: "If the Spartans agree to the plans I just mentioned, then they, like you, will be citizens of this new Spartan government, and will work with you. Governing this new country together. But if they object-"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crotokatax said with emphasis: "Then they can only spend their lives in the slave camps of the Kingdom of Theonia! You all! Don't worry, even if they live here with you in the future, they will not pose any threat to you, because among the Spartans we captured, there are less than 400 young and middle-aged men. Even if there are broken troops returning one after another, they will not There will be more than 500 people, and the combined population of your two tribes is more than 10 times theirs. What's more, our army is stationed here, so you don't have to worry at all!"
