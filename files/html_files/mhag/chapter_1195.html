   Chapter 1195 The reaction of the Arcadian Alliance The reaction of the Arcadian Alliance

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Initially Agesilaus planned to strengthen the defenses on the north and south sides and completely block the Theonian army from the country. This was due to insufficient strength. Passive military defense had to be adopted.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus knew very well that it could not last. Sparta, which could only be beaten passively, would inevitably be spurned by its allies and lose its hegemony. Therefore, after the Persian reinforcements landed in Corinth, he saw a bit of victory over Theonia. With the army's chance of victory, he took the risk to lead the main force northward. He was originally prepared to withdraw and defend once the battle failed, but it backfired...

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the Theonian army built a camp in Arcadia, The soldiers of the Mountain Reconnaissance Brigade once sneaked into the northern part of Sparta's territory and had a preliminary understanding of Sparta's defense situation in the north, so the two companies of the Seventh Army cautiously explored along the river valley.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a result, when I arrived at the Spartan defense camp, I found that it turned out to be an empty camp!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The company captain was confused and surprised, and immediately occupied the camp. At the same time, the more curious troops continued to explore south, and happened to run into a group of fleet infantry sent by Sekelion to the north to report the good news to the main force of Theonia.

 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now that Clotokatax saw this battle report, he felt a little complicated. He finally won a great battle and would soon be able to embrace the great glory of conquering Sparta, but he didn't expect it. This honor has been snatched away by the First Fleet, even though the First Fleet is nominally under his command.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As the Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Military Affairs, Printols did not care too much about the differences between the army and navy and the ownership of military merits. He was more accustomed to considering issues from a strategic level. He saw the influence of Clotokatax. Thoughts, he comforted softly: "From the battle report, the landing operation of the 1st Fleet was arranged carefully and cleverly, but even so they paid a high price. It also shows that the Spartan army left behind still has considerable combat effectiveness.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   According to previous investigations, the Spartans' defense in the north of the territory is also very tight, and the mountains in the north are not conducive to our army's offensive, and it is more convenient for the Spartans' defense. If you want to enter Sparta from the north, you must It will cost a lot of casualties, and it is likely to make the battle longer! The situation in Greece is complicated now, and the longer time is delayed, the worse it will be for us. Fortunately,
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sekerian strictly implemented your order and launched the landing operation in time. ...gives us enough time to calmly deal with the challenges of other Greek city-states."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing this, Clotokatax was silent for a while, then suddenly smiled at himself and said calmly: "Lord Printors , I admit that I am a little jealous of the 1st Fleet's conquest of Sparta. But I think the success of the 1st Fleet has not much to do with my orders. It mainly depends on Lord Sekerian's ability. No wonder my father praised him as the king of the kingdom. One of the best military commanders in the world!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But you are right, the 1st Fleet can conquer Sparta so quickly, which is a good thing for our army and the kingdom, so we should happily accept Sekeli Ann's invitation, rush to Sparta, handle post-war matters as soon as possible, and meet new challenges."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors was surprised that this relatively young prince could change his mentality so quickly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   During this period While getting along with Clotokatax, this prince who was steady, unassuming, hard-working, able to listen to opinions humbly, and was good at getting along with others left a deep impression on Printoles, but he still He was a little surprised that the young prince could change his mentality so quickly, and he was more optimistic about his future. At the same time, he said to him: "I suggest that His Highness tell the soldiers the news now, even though it will cause them to be dissatisfied with the First Fleet. , but by the time they arrive at Sparta City, they may have adapted and will not have any conflict with the soldiers of the First Fleet."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crotokatax agreed to Printors' suggestion and immediately reported the news Pass it on.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not long after, it really caused a commotion in the army. Although there were restrictions from military law and the officers, the march was not affected, but the legionnaires continued to curse the 1st Fleet along the way, which also made Crotoka Taxi Once, he became deeply aware of the contradiction between the Theonian navy and the army and the soldiers' deep desire for honor.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When they were about to reach the southern border of Tegea and rendezvous with Tegetinos, the army encountered the councilors of the Arcadian League.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the battle, Clotokatax was busy dealing with post-war matters and did not send anyone to notify the Arcadian Alliance.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Mandinian guides were eager to return to their motherland to inform the council of the Dionyian commander's decision, and did not go to Megalopolis.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Members of the Arcadian Alliance saw the vast crowd returning from Tegea and passing through the territory of Megalopolis on the second day, including the Theonian army and thousands of prisoners. When I asked about it, I learned that the Theonian army had a large-scale battle with Sparta yesterday and won the final victory.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, they were also surprised to know: In the decisive battle between Theonia and Sparta, the Tegeans suddenly betrayed and attacked the flanks of the Theonia army, causing it a lot of trouble, so The enraged Theonian army captured Tegea after the war, captured its surviving people, and wanted to return them to Messenia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The councilors of the Arcadian Alliance were shocked by the cruel decision made by the Theonians. You must know that there are three councilors from Tegea among them. Even if they repeatedly requested and protested, the Theonians in charge of escorting The soldiers also refused to release the prisoners.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a result, the Arcadian councilors headed by Lycomedes had no choice but to rush to Tegea and prepare to intercede with the commander of the Theonian army, but they happened to meet him halfway.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax felt a headache when faced with the requests of Arcadian councilors.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the battle that day, he was too angry because of Adoris's war, and issued such an order. After a day, his mood was relatively stable, and he regretted that the order was too cruel, but the order was carried out and he got the support of the soldiers. Welcome, changing it at will would only weaken his authority, so he could only accept it regardless. Now, a victim came to ask for an explanation, which made him feel very embarrassed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors saw his embarrassment and offered to go to these Arcadian Alliance councilors on his behalf.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax thanked him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors ran out of the team on horseback and rushed to the road ahead. When he saw the Arcadian councilors, his face was as cold as frost, and he said angrily: "The Arcadians were the Your request won our trust, and the kingdom formed an alliance with you. So when Mandinia was besieged, we sent a large army to rescue.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the way we learned that another ally, Tegea, was also besieged. When the Spartans stormed, we were in danger, so in order to rescue Tegea, we ignored the fatigue of the march and fought a battle with the Spartan army. Who knew that this was a conspiracy!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Damn the Taegians!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   They colluded with Sparta, set a trap, and sent troops to sneak attack our army's rear during the battle, causing the army to pay a heavy price of more than 3,000 casualties!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Moreover, General Adoris, the son of our great Majesty Davos, also died in battle!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Tegeans collectively betrayed the covenant and violated the sacred oath, and of course they will be severely punished!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is not even clear whether this punishment can calm His Majesty's anger caused by grief.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Anyone who knows the past history of Theonia should know that our Holy Kingdom of Theonia keeps its promises, but we also hate betrayers!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now that Tegea betrayed you at the critical moment, we have to express deep doubts about whether your city-state can still fulfill its covenant!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors' appearance of launching an attack to accuse the Arcadian Alliance members was surprised. They did not expect that Tegea's betrayal would have such serious consequences: more than 3,000 casualties, equivalent to one of their city-states. The number of casualties among the young and middle-aged Theonian soldiers! Even the son of the Theonian king died in battle!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now, the Theonian army defeated the Spartan coalition in the battle, which has demonstrated to them the Theonian The Arcadian councilors who were so powerful that they began to fear its force were really worried that the King of Theonia would be angry with their city-state, and they all began to express their opinions: "We Mantinians and Sparta are mortal enemies, and we are still The initiators of this covenant will never betray you Theonia like Tegea!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The same goes for us Furios. Spartan mercenaries destroyed our villages and destroyed our fields. Our people hate the Spartans to the core and will never cooperate with the Spartans!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Since we Okomenus have sworn in the name of the gods and signed an alliance agreement with Theonia, we will definitely abide by this agreement within the time limit and will never go back on it!" ...
  </font>

   of Arcadia They were eager to defend themselves and prove their innocence, completely forgetting the purpose of their trip. Only the Tegeans were pleading loudly: "General, we admit that the Tegeans made a big mistake, but many of them may Not voluntarily, but under the coercion of the Spartans and the pro-Spartan nobles of Tegea, it has to be like this! I hope you can forgive their sins. The Tegeans will definitely be grateful and will do so in the future Fully assist the Theonian allies!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors looked at these Tegea members with an unusually pitiful look, and said softly: "You don't know, right? Our army hasn't arrived yet. Before arriving at Tegea, the pro-Spartans in Tegea colluded with the Spartans and incited the people to massacre all anti-Spartan factions and their relatives in the city. After we broke through the city of Tegea, only a handful of them were found. The survivors, they are the only ones who have not been punished, and are currently receiving treatment in the city. I hope Hades will bless you, and among them are your relatives..."
