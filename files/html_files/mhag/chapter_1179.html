   Chapter 1179 The Battle of Tegea (5)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Muklu rushed to the vicinity on horseback, he saw this scene, and his heart suddenly sank to the bottom: Oh no, the Tegea people have indeed rebelled!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Mantinian guide Calicenos next to him was also dumbfounded: "This...this...the Tegeans betrayed the Arcadian Alliance?!...General Mukru, I can swear to Zeus, We in Mandinia don't know about this!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Muklu's face was gloomy, and he didn't understand Calicenos's excuse. He immediately turned the horse's head, clamped the horse's belly hard, and galloped towards the army command center. The commander must be informed of this terrible turn of events immediately.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Kalisenos glanced angrily in the direction of Tegea City and followed Muklu.

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a squad leader, when the fifty soldiers under his command were excitedly chasing the enemy, he had to try his best to control them. The whole detachment, don't let the soldiers get scattered.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is a requirement of the "Theonia Military Law". The First Legion is one of the most combat-effective legions in the Theonia army, not only because of the soldiers' strong combat skills, but also because of their strong execution of military law. , but today it is becoming more difficult to control the formation of the unit during the pursuit. This is because the enemies in front are not slow to escape even if they are wearing armor and holding shield guns. Except for the soldiers in the initial rout. Taking some advantage, and soon after the distance between the two sides widened, the soldiers were never able to catch up with the defeated troops. This made the proud soldiers of the First Legion very unconvinced: In the annual Theonian army competition, The First Legion has never fallen into the top three in the armed race event, and now it can't outrun a group of mercenaries!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldiers tried their best to catch up, but naturally they couldn't listen to the orders of the team officers. Max's voice was almost hoarse from shouting, and he could only watch helplessly as the entire team was about to completely disperse.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just then, he heard the sound of a military bugle coming from behind.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He instinctively looked back, and in the dust and mist he saw those colorful military flags flying high one after another beginning to wave rapidly from front to back.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He didn't think too much, and immediately shouted loudly: "Stop advancing, this is the order of the legion! Stop advancing!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldiers beside him also shouted with him, one by one, and soon the soldiers in front of Max were all The pursuit stopped. Although everyone was breathing heavily, they all looked at the fleeing enemies in front of them unwillingly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Gather! Gather quickly!!..." Max shouted in a hoarse voice.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, there was no need for him to exert so much effort, and the soldiers around him automatically moved closer to him. Some were not even soldiers from his unit, but the white tassel on the crown of Max's helmet gave them a choice. This was an instinct after countless trainings.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just as the soldiers of the First Legion were moving closer to the squad leader and company captain, the defeated soldiers in front also stopped running away one after another, then roared, turned back and fought back.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Damn it! They are faking defeat!..." Max, who was at the front of the legion, was shocked when he saw the scene in front of him. Once again, regardless of the stinging of his throat, he shouted with all his strength: "Assemble!!" and at the same time raised his spear. In the air, it kept waving.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dolios, a former member of the Spartan King's Guard and the former military governor of Messenia, abandoned Messenia without a fight because of the attack of the Theonian army. He was almost captured by the Council of Elders and the Overseers. He was expelled from his mother country.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although he was eventually convicted and made meritorious service, his life in Sparta was not easy. The Spartan people who had lost their land in Messenia looked at him angrily and even shouted loudly. He was insulted, but he could only swallow it. He who had always been regarded as an honor by his parents, wife and children had never been insulted like this. He didn't know how he got through those days, but all his patience was for today.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He is almost 50 years old and is fighting on the front line today as an ordinary soldier. In the previous battle, he had been defending and trying to save his energy. However, the fast running after that made him feel a little uncomfortable wearing heavy armor. Out of breath, after all, time is not forgiving, and the Theonian soldiers are still chasing closely. This is the first time he has encountered it in the battles he has experienced in the past. He finally decided to give up running, stopped, and wanted to take advantage of the opportunity. He still had some physical strength and could kill one by one, but he saw that the pursuers behind him stopped one after another.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is something Dolios has never seen in previous battles. When they used this tactic before, the enemies ran more and more scattered during the pursuit. In the end, they were completely scattered. Many people even threw away their helmets. shield, so once they counterattack, they can easily defeat the enemy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But what he sees now through the eyeholes of the Corinthian helmet is: all the Theonian soldiers have intact weapons and armor, and they are still actively retracting in an attempt to reorganize their formation...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dolios is anxious. , he could never allow the hard work of the soldiers to go to waste in the end, so he lightly bumped the surrounding soldiers with his copper shield, shouted: "Attack!!" Then, holding the shield gun, he accelerated and rushed back.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The enemies must not be allowed to reunite!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ...With this belief, he jumped up, struggled to swing out the stabbing gun in his hand, and stabbed the Theonian soldier closest to him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldier quickly lifted the long shield upwards, and with a crisp "Cang!" sound, the gun tip pierced the corner of the long shield.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dolios followed the inertia of the forward movement and slammed forward with his copper shield. The two shields collided and made a "bang!" sound. The Theonian soldier was knocked backward by the strong momentum.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dolios thrust out the spear again, and the spear stuck to the upper edge of the opponent's long shield, stabbing the enemy's exposed throat like lightning.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldier quickly tilted his head, and the spear knocked off his helmet, leaving a horrific bloody mark on his face, which made him scream in pain.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dolios did not wield the bayonet again. He used a round shield to push away the injured Theonian soldier and continued to rush forward. He believed that his comrades would completely eliminate the enemy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just after running a few steps, a force suddenly hit my back, followed by severe pain. Under the severe pain, the accumulated strength was rapidly lost.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He staggered a few steps and looked back in shock, only to see the Theonian wounded soldier looking at him resolutely. The hand originally holding the bayonet was empty, and was immediately overwhelmed by the swarming Spartan warriors.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dolios slowly fell to the ground. He was still very unwilling to die: he failed to kill a Theonian soldier to clear his name.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the Spartan warriors who fell behind during the escape turned to attack, the soldiers in the front would also turn to attack immediately. It took a very short time for the whole army to switch from rout to attack, and there was no need to use bugles to direct it. , this is the tacit understanding they have cultivated through long-term training since childhood.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldiers at the forefront of the Theonian First Legion had dispersed. Facing the surging Spartan warriors, they could not return to the team in time. However, even though they knew they were outnumbered, they did not turn around and escape, but were brave Blocking the enemy in place and buying some time for the comrades behind them is the result of long-term training by the soldiers of the Theonia Legion in accordance with military law.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Max's detachment numbered less than 50 people, but the situation was critical. He could no longer wait and immediately loudly ordered: "Turtle shell formation!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The entire detachment quickly formed a square formation of five people across the line, facing the incoming Spartans. In the column, the outermost soldiers raised their long shields to their chests to form a shield wall. The soldiers inside put their long shields on their heads. Then everyone threw away their bayonet and drew out their short swords, because they were sealed by the long shield. In the small space, the stabbing spear could no longer be used.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Almost all the team officers gave the same order, because the hastily formed phalanxes were far apart, and without friendly support for the time being, the turtle shell formation was undoubtedly the strongest in defense when faced with encirclement.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as Max's temporary team formed a formation, the Spartans rushed forward. Although the Theonian formation was strange to them, they did not stop attacking: shield tops, gun pokes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two most commonly used attack methods obviously have no effect on Theonia's strange formation. Some Spartan warriors simply hit it with their bodies. As a result, the Theonia soldier's dagger sprang out from the gap in the shield like a poisonous snake. , stabbing it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Spartan warriors who were charging at the front were unable to use the turtle shell formation for a while, but the soldiers who kept coming from behind forced them not to stay longer and continued to charge forward.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It didn't take long for the entire Max squadron to be surrounded by Spartan soldiers. The Theonian soldiers in the small and crowded space could not see the situation outside clearly, but they could hear the enemy's ear-splitting roar. Each one of them nervously resisted the impact from the long shield, and at the same time carefully dodged the spear that came late from the gap, and the short sword in their hands was also constantly thrust out to stab those who were too close to the shield formation. The enemy...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   these small Theonian phalanxes at the forefront are like small boats in the rough waves, swaying left and right, and may capsize at any time. Every minute and every second, they are attacking the Theonian soldiers in the tortoise shell array. It seems so long.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For the team officers at the center of each array, the only thing they can do is to constantly encourage the soldiers with hoarse voices: "Brothers, hold on! Our reinforcements will be here soon!... "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ever since the right wing of the Spartan army began to fake defeat, Agesilaus had been in a state of tension, and he sent out troops from time to time. The guard rushed to the front and carefully explored the fighting situation in the middle. When he learned that the mercenaries on the right end of the middle began to retreat and there was some chaos, he was so angry that he cursed and even wanted to rush over in person to boost morale, but was dissuaded by the guards.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not long after, when he learned that the Spartan warriors had stopped retreating, started to counterattack, and disrupted the Theonian array, he was excited again, tightened his right fist, and waved it vigorously: " Well done!"
