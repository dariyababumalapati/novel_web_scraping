   Chapter 1296 The Price of Victory
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There were several bloody wounds on Sekerian's broad back. What caught Midorades' attention the most was that his dark skin, which had been exposed to wind and sun for many years, was now extremely white. Heart-stopping.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "How is his condition?" Midorades worriedly asked the doctor next to him who was dispensing medicine.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The doctor looked up at him, hesitated for a moment, and then whispered seriously: "...It's not good. He has many arrows in his body, he bleeds too much, and he has been soaked in sea water for too long..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Midorades thought in his heart Startled, he wanted to ask again, but he heard a weak voice ringing in his ear: "...Mido...you are here...how is the battle going?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Midorades looked for the voice, but saw Sekerian, who had been motionless before, turned to look at him with his eyes wide open.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Doctor, he...he's awake!" Midorades said happily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Not long after he was brought here, he woke up and kept asking about the situation of the naval battle..." The doctor sighed and said, "Go tell him quickly, lest he worry about this all the time and affect his recovery."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Midora Des walked to the head of the bed, squatted down, thought for a moment, and then knelt half on the ground again, so that both himself and Sekerian could save effort when talking.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But before he could speak, Sekerian smiled: "...It's not easy. Being able to make the proud commander of the Second Fleet kneel down, it seems that I will have to get hurt more in the future..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Midorad Si looked at his unusually dry lips and said in a deep voice: "If I were you, I would calm down and listen carefully now, so that my body can recover faster."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sekerian rolled his eyelids and stopped talking.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Midorades then said in a deep voice: "According to rough statistics after the war, we sank more than 160 warships and captured nearly 350. The Persian fleet suffered heavy losses. Of course, we also paid a high price. , a total of 218 warships were sunk...Thanks to you leading that small number of warships to hold on offshore, which bought us time and also weakened the enemy's physical strength and morale, so we could win more easily. Now Persia The fleet has been completely defeated, and the dominance of the entire Near East Sea will be controlled by us!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Secorian showed a look of relief: "... We finally lived up to His Majesty's expectations... It's really a pity that I couldn't Seeing the result of this great naval battle with my own eyes... Hey, I, Sekolian, have always been accustomed to attacking... I suffered a failure in my first defensive battle... I am still not as good as you in this regard... "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Meidolades said seriously: "As I said just now, it was precisely because you chose to persevere in the face of a Persian fleet that was several times larger than ours that we won a great victory. This glorious victory was It was completed under your command! Due to this victory, the powerful Theonia fleet will never have any chance of defensive operations from now on!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sekerian looked at his colleagues blankly, after a while After a while, a look of fear actually appeared on his pale face: "...Mido, am I getting old?... During the battle with the Syracuse Navy... my ship was also sunk... I I fell into the sea and was also hit by an arrow in my shoulder... but I only rested for more than ten days and it was fine... But now... But now... I can't move except for my neck... I... I... can't feel anything at all To the existence of his own hands and feet..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Midorades heard this, he wanted to comfort him, but he was anxious but didn't know how to speak, but he heard the doctor behind him remind him: "This general, I It's time to give medicine to the patient. In order not to affect the treatment, please go back first and come to visit him later."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Have a good rest and you will get better!" Midorades had no choice but to stand up and grab Sekerian. He squeezed his hand hard, trying to encourage him, but the coldness of the other's palm frightened him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sekerian couldn't raise his head to look at him, so he could only say softly: "Mido... I leave the fleet to you... take care of the brothers..." "Don't
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   worry, I will!" Midorades solemnly said respond.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When he left the hospital bed and saw doctors and nurses surrounding him, completely covering Sekerian's figure, he couldn't help but feel an unspeakable sadness in his heart
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ... ………………………………

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The vast majority of the Theonian army that landed in Egypt has moved to the territories of Peramses and Daphne. Only the First Army is still stationed in Memphis, because King Davos remains here.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As the commander-in-chief of the entire army, Davos should have stayed with the large army. He has done so in the past, but this time it is different. The Kingdom of Theonia has just annexed Egypt, although Asistes has been appointed to govern Egypt, but having King Theonia sitting here will undoubtedly make the handling of various government affairs smoother and more conducive to the smooth transition of Egypt. Therefore, Davos seizes the intermission time of this period of war to help Asistes solved some difficult problems. At the same time, he appointed Alexis to Daphne to temporarily take charge of the army for him. He also asked Philisius, Epithenes and others to assist him in managing military affairs, planning and preparing raids. With the implementation of the Cyprus Island, this group of old people who had retired and originally only followed him to Persia were once again given important responsibilities by him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the military operation to raid Cyprus began, waiting for the results was an arduous process, especially for such a major military operation, so Davos did not sleep well these days.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On this day, at the strong request of Henipolis, Davos took a walk in the garden to relax after dinner.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The garden of the Pharaoh's Palace in Talib is vast, and a large artificial lake was dug in the center, with water from the Nile River introduced. Various aquatic plants such as lotus and lotus were planted in the lake, and various kinds of clipped wings were also stocked. There are wild ducks, wild geese, and even a rare hippopotamus... Various rare trees, flowers and plants are planted around the artificial lake, and some ostriches are even released.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is spring at this time, and the garden is full of flowers, colorful, birds and insects, and it is extremely lively.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Walking on the flat road by the lake, breathing in the moist air with the fragrance of grass and trees, makes people feel relaxed and happy, and their worries are gone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos couldn't help but sigh: "This is such a good place! Christoya and Agnes should be allowed to stay here for a while!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, General Prosaus is not Have you led the Greek coalition to completely defeat the Persian Army of Asia Minor? I believe that Miletus can be forced to surrender soon. You can let the two princesses come to Memphis for a while before going to Miletus..." As Davos's palace secretary The official and his personally authorized biographer, Hernipolis, was relatively familiar with the Davos family affairs.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos shook his head: "We haven't defeated the Persian fleet yet, and we haven't completely taken control of the Eastern Mediterranean. They can't come yet, it's not safe."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Henipolis secretly hated himself for talking too much, and unintentionally reminded His Majesty the King again. After hearing about the ongoing war, he was thinking of ways to divert the king's attention, but he heard Davos shout: "Don't stop it, let it come!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It turned out that there was an ostrich, probably out of curiosity, that was so bold It was walking towards Davos. The guards stepped forward to drive it away, but Davos stopped it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The ostrich was still just a baby bird, but its height was already similar to that of an adult. It walked straight to Davos with its long slender legs, its big eyes flickering, and it curiously looked at the new appointee. The king of Upper and Lower Egypt looked cute, but made the surrounding guards and followers nervous.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos couldn't help but stretched out his hand to it, and it immediately stepped back alertly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos smiled and said softly: "Don't be afraid."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The ostrich seemed to understand, stopped retreating, blinked its big eyes, tilted its head to the left, tilted its head to the right, and then walked up cautiously, using The long beak gently pecked the palm of Davos's hand. Seeing that Davos didn't respond, he pecked it several times harder.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The guards immediately shouted loudly. The ostrich felt scared and immediately turned and ran away.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's just a bird. What's there to worry about? It just made my hand itch with its peck." Davos complained without saying anything.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, would you like the guards to catch an ostrich for you?" Henipolis asked quickly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos waved his hand: "Don't do that, just watch them play and run freely in this garden, that would be interesting! Thanks to your suggestion, it is really interesting to walk around in this garden! -" Dai Voss waved his hand
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   . As Firth was talking, the smile suddenly froze on his face because he saw guards running hurriedly from the direction of the palace.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, the battle report was urgently sent from Naukratis!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos immediately took the papyrus roll tied with a black rope and couldn't wait to open it. After reading it, his face was uncertain.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, this is—" Henipolis felt nervous.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Our fleet defeated the Persian fleet, and the army successfully landed on Cyprus."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This is a great news! But... Your Majesty, you don't seem to be happy..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The battle report said that Sekerian was seriously injured. , has been paralyzed and unable to move..." Davos said in a low tone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldiers and followers who originally cheered upon hearing the news of victory immediately fell silent, and everyone silently followed Davos on the path by the lake.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a long time, Davos stopped and said, "Herni, get ready to record."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes!" The entourage immediately gave Henipolis paper and pen, and brought wooden stools, and then the guards led With the followers retreating to a far distance, a cordon was set up.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Inform Midorades that after Sekerian's condition stabilizes, he will be sent back to Turiyi safely as soon as possible, and all the doctors in Turiyi Hospital will do their best to treat him. I hope... he can recover! "Davos sighed softly: "At the same time, he wrote to the Ministry of Military Affairs and asked Olivers and Printols to discuss erecting a statue of Sekolian in front of the Ministry of Military Affairs building and naming the First Fleet Sekolian. The possibility of a fleet."
