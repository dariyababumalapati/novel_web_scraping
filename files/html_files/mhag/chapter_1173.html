   Chapter 1173: Forced by Situation:
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When was the last time most Greek city-states formed a coalition?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Greco-Persian War a hundred years ago!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is to treat Theonia as an enemy like Persia!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This was very uncomfortable for Clotokatax and Printoles, who had Greek blood and Greek complexes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, when the messenger left, both of them looked very solemn.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors first broke the silence and comforted Crotokatax: "Your Highness, you don't have to worry too much! The Thebans have already said that it will not take long to form such an alliance that includes most of the Greek city-states. Time can do it. We still have enough time to conquer Sparta first.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Once Sparta is conquered, Messenia will be ours again, the Arcadian League will still be our ally, and Ellis will also be ours. We have expressed goodwill, so that we have stabilized most of the Peloponnese, and Thebes also supports us. Even if other city-states form a coalition to fight against us, their strength has been greatly weakened. With some power, we can defeat them and dominate the situation in mainland Greece!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax thought for a while and said cautiously: "Our arrival is like poking a hornet's nest. Unexpectedly, Delphi, Olympia and Corinth will hate us so much, which may complicate the situation in Greece, and many things may become uncertain... Indeed, the most important thing for us now is to seize the time to defeat the Spartan army. Let's get rid of this powerful enemy first. Moreover, defeating Sparta will help increase our prestige and will also be a deterrent to other Greek city-states." "Your
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Highness is right!" Printors nodded in agreement: "I think We can-"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Report!" The voice of the palace guard captain suddenly sounded outside the tent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What's the matter?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "An urgent message from Messenia!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax opened the letter and gradually frowned, lost in thought.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Printols was curious, he couldn't take the initiative to ask.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a while, Clotokatax put down the letter and said: "Senator Tisias wrote to say that Nafpaktos sent an envoy, hoping to allow some of their people to return to their motherland of Messenae. Sub-life".
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Nafpaktos?" Printors thought for a while and then said with some confusion: "I remember that this city-state seems to be located on the north shore of the Gulf of Corinth, near the exit of the bay. During the Peloponnesian War , it is not only an ally of Athens, but also the naval base of Athens in the Gulf of Corinth. The Athenian naval admiral Formio once won a naval battle with a small number and the Athenian army general Demosthenes once used it as a military base. , almost conquered the Acarnania, Ambunakia, Aetolia, and Locris regions... But why did this city-state make such a request?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lord Printors is worthy of being the chief of staff, I am very familiar with the military battles that have taken place." Crotocathax praised, and then explained in detail: "Before the Peloponnesian War, there was a large-scale battle in Sparta. Sparta was unable to extinguish the rebellion dominated by Messenians with the help of Athenian reinforcements. Finally, it reached a compromise with these helots and allowed them to leave Spartan territory.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Athens helped some of the Messenians who escaped. The Nians established Nafpaktos, which is said to have come from the suggestion of Pericles. This famous Athenian chief general did have a long-term vision, so Nafpaktos has always been the leader during the Peloponnesian War. A staunch ally of Athens, it played an important role.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the war, Nafpaktos was forced to dissolve the alliance with Athens. However, in recent years, Sparta was tired of wars and its strength was greatly weakened. Nafpaktos once again Closely related to Athens..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors was born as a commoner in Thurii. He was talented and intelligent, but because of his poverty, he did not receive much education when he was young. Later, when Theonia was established, he was the first to respond to Davos's call and participate in Study in the adult class of Thurii School.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After he escaped from illiteracy, he has not stopped studying to this day, but after all, he is old, so he mainly focuses on studying military affairs.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The new generation of Theonian citizens have received a relatively comprehensive education since childhood, with rich knowledge and wider exposure. As a prince, Crotokatax not only has to receive school education, but also complete the tasks given to him by Davos. The learning tasks assigned, the amount of knowledge possessed is relatively extensive, and cannot be compared with ordinary peers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The people of Nafpaktos requested to join Messenia on the grounds that they are descendants of Messenia..." Printors carefully savored what Clotokatax had just said, and was very surprised. He quickly reacted and said in a deep voice: "But they have close contact with Athens. I'm afraid there is secret instigation from Athens... Now the First Fleet's patrol in the Aegean Sea has made Athens dissatisfied, and now there are priests from Delphi and Olympia secretly Activities...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Once Messenia becomes unstable due to their participation, not only will the kingdom's efforts in Messenia be undermined, but it will also cause problems for the army's back path, and we have to guard against it!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lord Tisias is also aware of this problem, so he wrote to ask for instructions." Clotokatax raised the papyrus roll in his hand, but there was some hesitation on his face: "But we have already issued a call to the whole of Greece. , 'Welcome Messenian immigrants back to their motherland', these words have just been said not long ago, how can we regret it now?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Highness, we don't need to regret it." Printors suggested: "We just need to Pushing this matter back, it was said that "Messenia agreed in principle to their return to their motherland, but because there were too many people returning, Messenia temporarily did not have enough houses and land for resettlement, etc." Messenia will take the initiative to tell them to return after they are fully prepared.'"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax thoughtfully said: "You mean...when we defeat Sparta and stabilize Boro After the situation in Pennesa, do you agree to the demands of the Nafpaktos?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even after we dominate the situation in Greece, we can inform Nafpaktos again. After all, Messenia is under our control. Of course the time is up to us, and we haven't broken our promise anyway."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax nodded, picked up a pen and paper, thought about it for a while, and prepared to write a reply.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, the guard outside the tent came to report again: "Your Highness, the officer responsible for patrolling the Xiying Gate has brought a man, saying he is from Ellis and has very important news to tell you."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ellis?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ... Crotokatax was curious and confused, put down his pen, and said: "Let him come in."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Under the supervision of two palace guards, a Greek man dressed as a shepherd walked into the tent nervously. When he saw Crotocathax sitting at the top, he immediately shouted: "My lord! My lord! I The owner was Ionicus of Elis. He wrote a letter and asked me to deliver it to the commander of the Theonian army. I took the letter and ran away because I was afraid of being discovered and did not dare to take the main road. I didn't eat much during the two days of mountain walking, so I'm so tired—"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Stop talking nonsense, take out the letter quickly!" Printors said in a deep voice.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The man was struck by Printors' sharp eyes, and immediately trembled in fright, and quickly took out the letter from his arms.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The guard immediately presented the letter.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax opened the letter, and the content in the letter made his heart suddenly sink. He stared at the letter for a long time. After his mind calmed down, he raised his head and said to the guard: "Take him down first. After you have a good meal, tell the treasurer and give him 5 silver coins as a reward!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Thank you, sir! Thank you, sir!..." The man was so happy that he bent down and saluted again and again. Then he remembered something again and was busy. Said: "Please write a reply, so that my master can rest assured!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax nodded. After the guards and messengers exited, Printors immediately asked: "Your Highness, are you out of trouble?" What's the big deal?" Although Clotokatax concealed it well, Printols still saw some clues.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Krotokartak handed him the letter silently.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors quickly read the letter and his expression became solemn: "Your Highness, the letter said, 'The Olympian priests and the Pisa people persuaded the Council of Elys to join the Greek Alliance and fight against us on the pretext of surrendering to Elys. 'The letter also said, 'At the Council of Elys, the Olympian priests declared that their people would soon convince the Okomenians to rebel against the Arcadian League...' If the situation is true as stated in the letter Yes, the situation will be very unfavorable to us!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax clasped his hands tightly. Although he seemed a little nervous, he still analyzed seriously: "I heard Lord Tisias say when I was in Messenia. However, the father of the Elisian senator named Ionicus was a Messenian. He had witnessed our army retaking Messenia from the Spartans, and he was still in Messenia. Ya stayed for a while, liberated the Helots with Tisias and the others, and had a certain fondness for the Kingdom of Theonia, so he wrote to us immediately after learning the news.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He is probably also worried that if we Suffering a defeat, the newly independent Messenia will be occupied by the Spartans again...so he should not lie to us." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If Ellis turns us into an enemy, Okomenus or more Ah The city-state of Cardia also rebels, then our retreat will be threatened, and Messenia is likely to be attacked, making the battle with Sparta difficult to fight!" Printors said calmly. said the voice.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax rubbed his hands and asked hesitantly: "Should we... lead the army back to Messenia first, see how the situation changes, and then re-determine the next military action?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
