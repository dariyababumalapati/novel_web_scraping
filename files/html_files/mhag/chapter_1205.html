   Chapter 1205 The Theonian Army's New Action
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since it was difficult to break through from the front, the coalition generals decided to find another way after discussion.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   They left the main force to continue attacking in the north to confuse and contain the Theonians, and divided more than 10,000 soldiers to go around Argos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This army was mainly drawn from the Thessaly and Athenian armies, mainly composed of Illyrian peltasts and Thracian peltasts, and was personally led by Iphicrates, preparing to march from the northeastern border of Sparta. Cross the mountains, then raid Taetia (not Taigea). After capturing it, it can be used as a relay base for the coalition forces. From here, they can continue to attack south. The situation will undoubtedly be much better.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the secret mobilization of the Greek coalition forces did not escape the eyes of the mountain reconnaissance soldiers. After receiving the news, Printors immediately guessed the Greeks' intentions. He suggested that Clotokatax quickly adjust the military deployment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Iphicrates led the light shield soldiers across the mountains and arrived panting at Taetia, they were surprised to find that the Theonian army had already been lined up here.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Iphicrates decisively ordered a retreat, but the Theonian army quickly launched a pursuit. Although the mountain people of Illyria and Thrace were good at running in the mountains, there were still many of them who were exhausted. They were overtaken by the recharged Theonian light armor. As a result, nearly 1,000 Greek coalition forces were captured before the battle was fought. Even Iphicrates himself felt frustrated.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Greek coalition generals had to discuss again, and finally decided to shift the direction of the attack and concentrate their efforts on attacking Messenia, because the terrain in its north is relatively flat and wide compared to the northern border of Sparta.

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Sparta was conquered, the Theonian 1st Fleet quickly received an order from the Ministry of Military Affairs: Stop in the Aegean Sea In addition to some warships doing a good job in defending the waters south of the Peloponnese, its main force will work with the 3rd Fleet and the already assembled Ninth Army and Tenth Army to attack the four islands on the west coast of mainland Greece. The islands launched an attack. From north to south, they were Kercyra, Leucas, Keralonia, and Zakynthus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not long after Kercyra became an ally of Athens, Leucas, Keralonia, and Zakynthus all belongs to the Peloponnesian League. After the Theonian army raided Messenia, in order not to arouse the common hatred of the Greek city-states, although there were fleets carrying supplies every day, these three islands, and did not take any military action against them. It only dispatched the 3rd Fleet to patrol its surroundings from time to time to deter them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the people of these four islands learned that the Theonia army had captured Messenia and declared war on Sparta, they were frightened every day and did not dare to take any hostile actions against Theonia, but they did not expect that What they worry about most still happens.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Corcyra has suffered many wars in the past two or three years, and like a grassroots, it fell to Sparta and Athens. Facing the attack of the more powerful Theonian army, the Corcyra people He chose to surrender directly.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Theonia landing force immediately seized its few remaining dozen warships and strictly controlled the entry and exit of ships in several ports on the island.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Later, the weak Leukas and Keralonia also chose to surrender, and only the people of Zakynsu put up some resistance.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the two Theonian legions plus nearly 10,000 fleet infantry attacked a small island. They were killing chickens with a knife. In less than four days, Zakynsu was completely conquered.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The surrender of the four islands of Kercyra, Leucas, Keralonia, and Zakynsus means that the west coast of mainland Greece can be completely blocked by the Theonian fleet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   During this period, the Ellis people opposite Zakynsu were very nervous. They hurriedly transferred the troops attacking Messenia back and deployed them on the coast to defend against the possible landing of the Theonian army, which was relieved. Messenia's defensive pressure.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Also during this time, Leoticides led the army and boarded the fleet provided by the Phoenician allies headed by Carthage. Under the escort of the second fleet, he sailed eastward along the coast of Africa. They encountered two storms on the way. Fortunately, the Phoenicians had been traveling on this channel all year round and were very familiar with the sea conditions. They came ashore to take shelter in time, so that the entire fleet and fleet did not suffer major losses.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seven or eight days later, the huge fleet entered the waters near Egypt. In order to prevent accidents, Leoticides led his army to quickly land on the beaches near the western part of the Nile Delta.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, there was no need for him to be so nervous. King Artaxerxes of Persia had just arrived in Phenicia with his undead army. At this time, although there were already thousands of Persian warships gathered in Tire, they came from various regions ( Including the Phrygian fleet led by Timotheus), lacked unified command, and the appointment of its wartime naval commander would be decided after Artaxerxes personally met with the naval admirals.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, during this period, some Persian naval admirals were busy running relationships and gathering information in Tire, and did not have much energy to manage the fleet. Hundreds of thousands of sailors from various regions crowded the various ports of Tire with nothing to do. Avoid conflicts and contradictions.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Tyrians and the fleet generals were already having a headache just to maintain order. How could they have the energy to actively carry out combat missions?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Only Timotheus insisted on leading the Phrygian fleet to patrol the waters near Egypt once every four days, not only to detect the enemy's situation, but also to familiarize himself with the sea conditions. Even though the task was relatively easy, the Phrygian crew still had a lot of resentment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On this day, the Phrygian fleet did not go on patrol. In fact, even if it went on patrol, it would be impossible for the Phrygian fleet, which only had dozens of warships, to face the Theonian 2nd Fleet, which was responsible for guarding the fleet. Fight against it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hundreds of thousands of Persian troops gathered in Phenicia, and their momentum was so huge. Egypt was only separated from it by a small Jerusalem area, and the sea route was even closer. Therefore, the news that "the Persian army was about to invade" had spread throughout Egypt. At this time, nearly four The arrival of the Vandionian army undoubtedly gave the panicked Egyptian people a shot in the arm.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Theonian reinforcements were first warmly welcomed by the people of the city of Naukratis, which has a Greek colonial tradition. The Persian officials in the city did their best to meet any request made by Leoticides.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Moreover, after Pharaoh Tanis received the news, he was overjoyed and personally took a boat to greet them. This was an unprecedented honor for the Theonian reinforcements.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For this reason, Leotychides agreed to the Pharaoh's request and asked all the soldiers to be fully armed, line up in neat columns, and walk to Memphis along the banks of the Nile, which was equivalent to an armed parade.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing the news, the Egyptian people lined up to welcome them. The majestic image of the Theonian army greatly enhanced their confidence in fighting the Persians.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After completing the transportation mission, the 2nd Fleet and the Phoenician fleet began to return westward. However, when they reached the waters of Cyrenaica, the 2nd Fleet did not continue westward, but turned around and headed north, passing through Crete. , entered the Gulf of Lagnia and joined the First Fleet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the end of July, just when the Greek coalition forces had been unable to break through the defense lines established by the Theonian army on the northern border of Messenia and Sparta, all the ports of the Theonian Holy Kingdom on the east coast and south coast of the Italian peninsula The town suddenly became lively. Hundreds of cargo ships gathered at various ports. The people in the town also gathered at the port, old and young. While welcoming the army composed of their relatives onto the cargo ship, they prayed for Hadi. Si bless them and return with great honors.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On this day, from Riminium in the north, to Sipentum in the east-central part, to Brindisi and Odrum in the southeast, to Locri, Silitium, and Crotone in the south. , Thurii, Tarantum... Ships full of soldiers sailed out from these port towns one after another, gradually forming long sea dragons. They crossed the Adriatic Sea and passed through Kerkyra and Leuca. Sri Lanka, Cephalonia, Zakynsu, etc.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   These islands are now completely controlled by Theonia, and the fleet can stop at any island to rest and replenish water.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Moreover, several fleets of Theonia also made full use of these islands to conduct a relatively tight blockade on the west coast of mainland Greece, making the Greek people, especially the Ayles, unaware that there were thousands of ships full of Orian soldiers. Ships were passing by the waters near them continuously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   These troop transport ships converged on the Gulf of Messenia and the Gulf of Lagnia respectively, entered the port one after another, and landed ashore.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Due to the approach of the Greek coalition forces, the Spartans were once again restricted. Their adult males were restricted to temporarily live in the port of Hilles, and the females and The children were forced back to life in warrior training camps, and were looked after by thousands of heavily armed helots who had been allocated land.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus was very angry about this and once protested to Clotokatax, but the prince gave a very good reason: the Greek coalition declared war on Theonia, and one of the important reasons was to save Sparta. For the safety of the Theonian army and to prevent some Spartans from doing wrong things and putting the entire Spartan people into an extremely bad predicament, such measures had to be taken.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Nowadays, everyone is a sword and I am a fish. Even though Agesilaus was angry, he was powerless and had to retreat in anger.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Once they became masters, the helots took very serious and strict care of their former masters, which made the Spartans feel very aggrieved and a fire burned in their hearts.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, today, they were surprised to see that the Lagnia Bay was filled with densely packed ships. Heavily armed Theonian soldiers continued to get off the ships. The entire coast of Sparta was crowded with people. How many people were there? Soldier?
