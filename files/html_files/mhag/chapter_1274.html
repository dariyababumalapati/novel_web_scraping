   Chapter 1274: Mobilization to declare war on Persia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the marathon race, nearly half of the runners failed to finish the race. Many runners even fell to the ground and passed out midway and were sent to the hospital for emergency treatment, which made the audience sigh.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   That night, the celebration banquet held at the Palace of Theonia was the final arrangement for the games, and it also followed the traditions of various Greek games. However, Theonia made it extra grand, not only inviting the champions of all competitions to attend and also invited important envoys from all friendly city-states participating in the games.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   King Davos personally hosted the banquet, and the atmosphere was very warm.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the banquet, he clinked glasses with Kalalistratus, Iphicrates, Epamilondas, Agesilaus and others.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now, being aloof and holding the authority over the entire Greek world, he treats these historical celebrities from previous lives just like he treats other people. He does not have much curiosity and does not talk too much with them to avoid causing misunderstandings by envoys from other city-states. This made Agesilaus's idea of ​​making some requests to King Davos, whom he finally met, come to nothing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the end of the banquet, Davos announced two things: First, in view of the success of this sports meeting, the Holy Kingdom of Theonia will hold a sports meeting every four years in the summer, and will try its best to make it the center of the entire Mediterranean world. The grandest celebration; secondly, tomorrow the Greek Parliament will hold an important enlarged meeting, not only inviting envoys from the Greek city-states participating in the games, but also envoys from other allied states to discuss important matters with them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Something important?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ...The envoys returned to the hotel where they were staying with all kinds of speculations. Some of them didn't even sleep well all night.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the Greek League meeting on the second day, Davos also attended in person and presided over the meeting.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Facing the envoys and parliamentarians from various city-states gathered together, he solemnly proposed the suggestion of "declaring war on Persia and forming a coalition to attack Asia Minor", which really surprised all participants.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, King Davos was not the first person to make this suggestion in front of envoys from various Greek city-states. As early as ten years ago, the Athenian orator Isocrates had repeatedly declared at Greek games and other public occasions that "the various Greek cities" The city-states should stop all conflicts and internal strife, unite, and while defending against the threat of Theonia in the west, bravely launch an attack on the mortal enemy Persia in the east, and completely eliminate the culprit that has caused the civil strife in Greece to continue. The Greeks obtained enough land to support a larger population..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Isocrates' speech was scorned by the top leaders of the Greek city-states, it had a certain impact on the Greek people.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the Greek War, this initiator, because of rumors in the city of Athens, said, "Without Isocrates' continued incitement, Athens would not have joined the anti-Theonian alliance, which ultimately led to today's predicament"... Therefore A few years earlier he had been banished by the citizens with pottery tablets and fled into exile in Asia Minor.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now after King Davos made this suggestion, he immediately announced: Regardless of whether the Greek Conference agrees or not, the Holy Kingdom of Theonia will dispatch more than 100,000 troops to attack Persia!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This gave the messengers a great shock.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, Davos made a suggestion: As long as the allies send troops to form a coalition, after each victory in the battle, Theonia will share the spoils equally with them, and after defeating Persia, it will also be based on the contribution of each alliance in the entire war. A part of the conquered Persian territory was divided as the overseas territories of the allies in Asia Minor...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As we all know, Persia is a wealthy kingdom, and the king of Persia is even richer in the world. For the Greek city-states with small country, poor land and financial distress, they can It is of course a good thing to earn wealth from Persia and nourish oneself.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For Greek powers such as Athens and Thebes, Theonia's control of the Greek Alliance has left them with no room to expand their power. If they can defeat Persia and gain possession of Asia Minor, it will give them another development The path to national strength... So most of the Theonian allies were moved by Davos' proposal, not to mention that Theonia has some unswerving supporters in the Greek Parliament, such as Messenia, A Cardia, Zakynsus... So the resolution to "declare war on Persia" was finally passed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The next step is to carefully discuss the formation of the Greek coalition and formulate a plan to attack Persia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A few days later, the news that "Theonia declared war on Persia" spread throughout the kingdom, and the people's enthusiasm that had not completely faded because of the kingdom's successful hosting of the sports games was rekindled.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When people were discussing this important kingdom event in the streets of various towns, Davos summoned Leoticides in the palace office.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Have you watched all of this sports meeting?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Because many competitions were held at the same time, I only watched part of it."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What do you think?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Although Greek city-states have achieved some good results in traditional sports events, In all competitions closely related to military affairs, the championship, second and third place are almost all won by athletes from our kingdom. This shows that the military quality of the citizens of Theonia is far better than that of other allies." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You! You! !" Davos laughed dumbly: "Three words, military."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, you came to me this time, don't you just want to chat with me?" Leoticides asked calmly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I can tell that there is resentment in your words. Isn't it because you are still dissatisfied with me for transferring you from the First Army to Camp Turiyi to serve as the chief instructor of the reserve army commanders?" Davos half-joked, right? , said semi-seriously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leotychides was silent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the year before last, Davos issued new instructions to the Ministry of Military Affairs: to establish the position of commander above the corps commander. As the highest level of front-line officers, corps commanders who have commanded multiple corps or joint forces and won many victories are appointed by Military Affairs. This position can be promoted after passing the ministry inspection. It is not only a big improvement in salary and position for the officers of the Kingdom of Theonia, but also has the honor of entering the Senate directly without being elected. In the event of war, the kingdom can These commanders were directly appointed as commanders-in-chief of the armies.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is a great incentive for all the kingdom's officers, but Davos knows that transferring those generals with outstanding military exploits and high prestige out of the army during peacetime and taking up some idle positions will definitely make people like Leotic Generals like Des who don't care much about their positions and devote themselves to the army are dissatisfied. However, in order to maintain the stability of the royal family and the kingdom in the future, he must try his best to improve the kingdom's army system while he is still in office and reduce the burden of Crotoka Tower. A burden for future generations.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, Davos would not express these secret thoughts at this time. He just coughed a few times and then said in a gentle tone: "Have you heard the news that the kingdom has officially declared war on Persia?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I already know. Your Majesty's visit to me this time may have something to do with it." Leoticides said calmly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos said slowly: "After discussing with the Ministry of Military Affairs, I think you are the best candidate to commander the coalition forces that are about to be formed, but I don't know what your wishes are?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides' dull face suddenly showed a trace of emotion. After seeing the change, he immediately said: "Your Majesty, I am willing to take on this important task!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A smile flashed at the corner of Davos's mouth. He picked up a booklet on the table and said: "In this case, the commander-in-chief of the Greek coalition forces The candidate is you! These are some matters that have been preliminarily determined at the Greek League meeting in the past few days. You take a look first."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides immediately took it and looked through it carefully. Suddenly his face changed slightly and asked : "Your Majesty, why is there a separate line after the line that Sparta sent 3,500 troops and 40 tons of wheat... Agesilaus sent 500 Spartan soldiers?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos looked at him, He said meaningfully: "That was added after Agesilaus came to discuss with me alone. Agesilaus will personally lead all the Spartan warriors on the Laconia land to participate in this military operation. He I hope that after the complete defeat of Persia, the kingdom can give the real Spartans a good separate territory in the west of Asia Minor..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus wants all the Spartan people to move out of Laconia and to Asia Minor. Colonization?!" Leoticides, who was always calm, showed a bit of surprise.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes." Davos nodded and said softly: "After Laconia formed a new government, the political situation was relatively stable at first, but when the original helots gradually got used to the new citizenship and eliminated After being afraid of the Spartans, their hatred of Spartans is also growing day by day...Hey, this is what I didn't consider very carefully at the beginning! After all, those who have been persecuted by the Spartans for so many years and died at their hands There are countless helots, and this kind of hatred cannot be eliminated easily!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the helots do not dare to openly conflict due to the regulations of the kingdom, they can suppress Spar through citizen meetings or other political means. Master, after all, their citizens account for more than half of Lagnia, and the Pilians also have a grudge against the Spartans, so for more than a year, the Spartans have had a hard time going to Asia Minor. Colonization may be a better choice for them..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In recent years, Leoticides deliberately blocked news from Sparta. He did not know that the people of Sparta were living in distress. After hearing this, Dai After Firth's words, he couldn't help feeling a little guilty, but at the same time he was also very sad: After all, Laconia was the homeland where the Spartans had lived for hundreds of years, and they just left like this?
  </font>

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a moment, he returned his attention to the roster and raised his own question: "The Spartans are very powerful in combat. I have no objection to them sending out troops alone, but why should Agesilaus be the leader?" Soldier? He is almost 80 years old, can he fight?"
