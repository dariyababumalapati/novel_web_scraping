   Chapter 1252 The Treatment of Athletes in Thurii
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Megakides is young, he has a firm mind and is not a person who can be easily persuaded, but at this moment he also hesitated.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, a shout came from behind him: "Megacides, we should go back!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The shout was from an official of the Cretan delegation and the leader of their archery team. It is also interesting to say that in the past, the ceremony was held in mainland Greece. In various sports games, contestants basically go to the competition venue on their own, and few city-states organize special teams to participate.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But this time when Theonia sent out an invitation, he required in the letter that each participating city-state and region must have officials lead athletes to form delegations and participate collectively, so as to facilitate management.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, Theonia will also make a special medal list based on the number of awards won by the participating regions and city-state delegations, which will be posted at the entrances and exits of each sports venue. It will be updated every day. By the end of the games, Theonia will Generous rewards will be given to the top three regions and city-states in total medal count.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is not only a matter of money, but also involves the honor of the city-state and the region. Therefore, it greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of the officials of the Cretan city-states to participate in the games. These Cretan nobles who had never cared much about local Greek affairs have Sign up to join the athlete delegation and go to Turii. Because there were so many people who signed up, a running race was actually held to select the team leaders. The person who made this suggestion had a good reason: to lead the team to Turii. Yi's Cretan officials are role models for athletes, and of course they must have a good body that is good at competition.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   These selected officials could not perform their duties very well at first. They only cared about themselves and did not take care of the daily diet and daily life of the athletes. After arriving at the training ground, they even participated in training themselves and sometimes had conflicts with the athletes... But , whether at the training ground or in the athletes' hotel, players and officials from other regions and city-states can be seen everywhere. Competition is everywhere. Under pressure, Cretan officials gradually completed the transformation of their identities and began to devote themselves to serving the athletes. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You must know that the leader of the team who is shouting is also from the motherland of Megakides. As a nobleman, he initially ignored Megakides, a commoner, but now he is able to teach Megakides on the training ground. After some care and help from the Cretan archery players, it was already a very big change. Of course, Megakides would not be unappreciative, and he reluctantly returned the bow and arrow to the target shooter.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   According to the regulations of the Games, for the sake of fairness, bows and arrows will be provided by the Games during the competition. This is the set they used in training. The quality is obviously much better than that of McGakis's own bows. He is now more and more powerful. The easier it becomes to use, the more I wish I could take a set home.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But he knew that a bow and arrow with exquisite workmanship and high quality was definitely expensive, and he couldn't afford it unless he could win the championship and get the generous reward.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "May Hades bless you and help you get a good ranking in the competition!" The target reporter smiled and expressed his blessing to him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Thank you!" Megakides felt warm in his heart. Since he arrived in Thurii, the Theonians he met have been friendly to him, which made him feel very kind, and even treated Dionysius for this reason. Hades, the patron saint of the Kingdom of Asia, had a good impression, so he responded: "May Hades bless you with a safe life!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When he returned to the team of Cretan players, the team leader Flax was already a little unhappy. He said patiently: "We have to go back to the hotel quickly! I just heard from the management here that in order to ensure the smooth holding of tomorrow's sports meeting, the Turiyi City Hall will implement a curfew in the entire city starting from this evening. In order to avoid trouble, we have to Hurry back to the hotel!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Under his urging, the Cretan players quickly packed their packages, left the archery range, and hurried eastward.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the archery range is a newly built venue to host the archery competition of this sports meeting, it does not cost as much money and time as the swimming pool and racecourse, because archery is an open-air competition and only needs to be built around the archery range. For the fence, just place long wooden benches in the form of steps for spectators to sit and watch behind the players.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is built to the west of Turiyi, next to the Turiyi Military Camp. Logically speaking, it is a bit remote from the city, but the roads nearby are busy and lively every day, and many people often enter the archery range to watch training. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But when the Cretan Archery Team embarked on the return journey, they clearly felt that there were fewer pedestrians on the road, and after entering the outer city, they frequently encountered patrol teams, which delayed a lot of time.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   By the time they returned to the Sportsman's Hotel, it was already dark and candles were lit in the lobby of the hotel.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Already dripping with sweat, Megakides and the others did not go to dinner immediately, but went to the hotel's bathhouse.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This athletes' hotel in the western outer city is built next to the Ramallah-Sewanee Arena. It consists of four large 6-story "Hui" buildings. In the middle of these "Hui" buildings is the bathhouse.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When they first moved in and took a bath in the bathhouse for the first time, they were confused by the cumbersome procedures, but now they have fully adapted to it and enjoy it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   By the time Megakides came out of the bath, he felt refreshed and exhausted. Even the pain in his arms had disappeared without a trace.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If only there were such a bathhouse in Heracleion!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ...McGacides had such an idea in his mind, but then he thought: If that's the case, there must be many people going to take a bath, and the cost will definitely not be low, unlike here where it is free!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hey, the Theonians are so happy!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This envy lasted until they entered the restaurant.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is a row of tables neatly arranged on one side of the restaurant. On each table is a large wide-mouthed clay pot, which contains steaming food: stewed chicken, egg custard, roast beef, fried fish, grilled food. Legs of lamb, haggis soup, honey bread, sweet wheat porridge...even wine, beer and fruit juice.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The dinner at the hotel every day was so rich and delicious, and they could eat and drink at will without any restrictions. When the dishes in the clay pot were finished, the waiters in the restaurant would add more at any time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Many civilian contestants like Megakides have never enjoyed such food and treatment in their lives. When they walked into the restaurant for the first time and heard the waiter say that they could eat and drink for free, they thought I had heard it wrong, and until I confirmed it was true, some people started eating and drinking so much that their stomachs became bloated, and they had to call a doctor urgently for treatment, which made it a joke.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Some players have speculated: This is a welcome banquet, which is why it is so special, and they will not be so generous in the future.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Unexpectedly, every breakfast and dinner after that would be like this (the athletes' restaurant does not provide lunch, but athletes are allowed to take a little breakfast out from the restaurant to eat during training at noon), which made all the players shocked and almost doubtful. I have arrived at the Elysee Paradise, which is often mentioned by Theonians.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Theonia is so powerful and rich! You should be very happy to be a citizen of this kingdom! How lucky you are to be able to participate in this sports meeting!..." After seeing the prosperity of the giant city of Turii and enjoying Turii After the various benefits provided by Yi to the athletes, the athletes recalled the bitterness they experienced in participating in other sports games, and felt even more valuable about the Theonian Games, especially when they learned from the waiter of the athletes hotel that the Thurii Municipal Government The Hall did not do this intentionally to please them. In fact, the athletes who come to Thurii to participate in the rugby and football finals every year also enjoy such treatment, so they are even more certain that Theonia is a paradise for athletes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before the games were held, Theonia had captured the hearts of almost all the athletes. All that Thurii had done was already worthwhile, because it had achieved one of the purposes of Davos holding the games.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Athletes continued to enter the restaurant, and by the time Megakides was carrying a wooden plate filled with the food he wanted to eat, the restaurant was almost full of people.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Here, Megakides!" Someone waved to him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Megakides hurriedly walked over: "Silitaeos, you came back very early!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Silitaos is also a young noble from Heracleion City in Crete, and he signed up to participate in this sports meeting. Running competition, after more than 20 days of getting along, the two people from the same city-state have become friends.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I didn't do much training today. I just wore the shorts they provided and tried running a few times. I felt okay. Starting, swinging my arms, stepping, and sprinting were all unaffected." Silitaos just finished speaking. Another Cretan runner next to him immediately complained: "I feel very affected. The fabric rubs against my thighs when I run, which is very uncomfortable! Sports games have always been naked, but Theonia insists on changing it." Tradition, letting everyone wear this thing is a blasphemy to the gods!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Silitaos glanced at him: "Since you are dissatisfied with this sports meeting, you can withdraw and not participate."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The man said naa: "The competition starts tomorrow. It's not good to quit at this time..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Come on, I see you can't bear to part with the free food and comfortable services here." Silitaos directly revealed his thoughts, Then he said half-jokingly and half-seriously: "Theonia is now the overlord of the entire Greek world. It is much more powerful than Sparta back then. Even Olympia and Delphi had to surrender to it, let alone wear it. Shorts, even if everyone is allowed to wear Bolton in the game, I don't think any city-state dares to object openly!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Moreover, think about it, Theonia allows women to watch the game. It is said that there will be Theonia at the stadium ceremony tomorrow. The princess and princess of Nia are sitting in the audience, so it is understandable that we wear shorts to compete."
