   Chapter 1186 Athens declares war
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I have long heard that the Kingdom of Theonia is very powerful in the Western Mediterranean, and some city-states have to succumb to your force. I don't quite believe it, but today on our own land in Athens, in the sacred At the Citizens' Assembly, our respected Eleusinian Mystery Torch Bearer Callias was actually threatened in public by a Theonian envoy, which made me truly believe in Theonian arrogance!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Iphicrates Standing up, pointing his finger at Karias, he said indignantly: "Citizens, do you still remember the first sentence of his speech? - 'I send my greetings to you on behalf of the two million citizens of Theonia' - this is Words of greeting! No, this is a threat! He is not only threatening Kallias, but also threatening every citizen of Athens! He is threatening us that if we do not agree to Theonia's request, they will send A powerful army to conquer Athens!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But what I want to tell you on behalf of the citizens of Athens is that Persia, which was more populous than Theonia decades ago, also sent envoys here to issue similar threats to us, but in the end we Won that war, so we Athenians are not afraid of any threats!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Iphicrates is right, we Athens are not afraid of any country, whether it is Persia or Theonia! Don't look at Dai There are many people in Onia, and they are afraid of war with Athens, otherwise they would not send an envoy to talk here!..." Under the influence of Iphicrates, some Athenian citizens waved their arms and loudly expressed their dissatisfaction. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Karias remained calm, and after the noise subsided slightly, he said confidently: "More than 10 years ago, Athens made a promise to Theonia, 'No more performances of 'The Theonia'" "This play." But when I walked into the city, I found that multiple theaters were repeatedly performing this play that humiliated the Theonians. Many Athenians learned that I was from Theonia. After Asia, not only will they look at you with contempt, but they will also call you a barbarian... The
  </font>

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   reason why I specially added the phrase "two million citizens" in my speech is to solemnly remind you that Dioni Asia is a big country and a powerful country in the Western Mediterranean. Regardless of whether you have a good or bad opinion of Theonia, you should first show respect for Theonia!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Think about Spain, which has caused you great harm. Da, how did you treat their envoys every time they came to Athens? Even when their troops plundered the villages near Piraeus, you still did not trouble their envoys and returned them safely. Every time you have a war with Sparta, whether you are at an advantage or a disadvantage, you finally choose to have a peaceful truce with Sparta...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Isn't the reason why you do this because Sparta is the most powerful in Greece? City-state, you must carefully consider the consequences of a war with it. Now, the Sparta that you have been cautious about is struggling to support itself in the face of the attack of the Theonian army. Therefore, facing a city more powerful than Sparta, The powerful Holy Kingdom of Theonia, should Athens show your respect and treat all issues related to Theonia carefully!!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Karias's words were deafening and made some citizens think deeply.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "When your Theonian fleet is showing off its power in the waters of Athens and its allies, intercepting merchant ships and threatening Athens' maritime security, you still want us to show respect to Theonia. It would be too difficult for others!" Another The general Cabrias suddenly stood up and attacked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Karias finally showed a hint of nervousness: The Athenians indeed mentioned this headache for him. Indeed, the arrogant behavior of the 1st Fleet was undoubtedly exacerbating the tension between the two countries. He also wrote to the expeditionary force commander Cronus. Tocatachus expressed his views, hoping that the prince could persuade Cyril to suspend patrols in the Aegean Sea at this stage to avoid further irritating the Athenians.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But judging from the current situation, Clotokatax failed to persuade Sekerian, who regarded himself as a man of great merit and acted unruly, so he had to rack his brains to answer this troublesome question.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, just as he was preparing his words and wanting to better appease the dissatisfied citizens of Athens, Callistratus spoke again: "Citizens, we all know the reason why this barren land of Attica can To nurture such a large population and prosper to this day, Athens relies not on the abundant products on the ground, but on maritime trade.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Through sea trade, we can buy enough cheap food to meet the needs of the people; through sea trade, we can earn With enough money, you can live a prosperous life and pay enough taxes. Therefore, the prosperity of maritime trade is related to the life and death of Athens!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But in recent years, Athens' maritime trade has shrunk, and the income of merchants has increased. Many workshops have begun to reduce production or even close down. The number of unemployed people in Athens and the port is increasing, but the price of food is gradually rising... Do you know the reason?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus' words were Like a burning torch thrown into an oil pot, the entire venue suddenly boiled.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "That's because Theonian merchants sell cheap olive oil in large quantities in various city-states. As a result, few people buy my goods. They pile up in the cargo station and eventually become rotten. That's all money!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A beautiful pair of The price of the ear pottery bottle has never been lower than 6 drachmas, but the Theonian merchants can sell it for four drachmas. They are malicious business competition against our Athens, let them do this again If this goes on, my pottery shop will collapse!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I am an excellent accountant. I have worked as an accountant for the big businessman Parsons for decades and I have been working hard. But a few days ago, he suddenly told me that because he was overseas Many of his shops have been in recession and their income has dropped sharply. He had to resign me. I left with several old people who had worked for many years. I was very dissatisfied with him, but now I know that all this turned out to be true. It's the fault of the Theonian merchants!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Wave after wave of condemnation continued to hit Karias in the center of the venue, making him feel great pressure. He frowned and his thoughts changed rapidly. , quickly thinking of ways to resolve the anger of Athenian citizens.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But at this moment, he heard the strong and deep voice of Callistratus: "Thank you for your speech to the citizens of Athens! We all know Theonia's ideas and requirements, and then we will 'Should we continue to be friendly to Theonia? Or help Sparta?' This important issue will be put to a vote, so please-" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Please wait, I have something else to say!" Caria Si felt strongly uneasy, so he requested urgently.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Please abide by the order of our conference and leave the venue immediately!" Callistratus looked at him indifferently and said firmly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Karias hesitated to speak, and finally sighed helplessly. Before the guards came, he took the initiative to leave the center of the venue. Although he was a little disappointed, he still faced the insults of the Athenian citizens with his head held high and walked out. He came to this Athenian Citizens' Assembly that he had longed for...

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the afternoon, he was invited to the city hall of Athens, where the executive committee of generals headed by Callistratus was welcoming him. arrival.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus said to him solemnly: "On behalf of all the citizens of Athens, we officially inform you that Athens has decided to join the Greek Alliance to help Sparta resist the invasion of Theonia!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Callias Already mentally prepared, but still resentful in his heart, he mocked in a cold voice: "Your efforts in manipulating the entire Citizens' Assembly were not in vain. Congratulations on finally achieving your goal."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus looked very calm. He said calmly: "You are indeed very eloquent, but there will definitely be a war between Athens and Theonia. This is inevitable, and choosing to start the war at this time is the best time for Athens." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Look. Come on, you are very confident that Athens will win!" Karias sneered again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I know Theonia is very powerful." Callistratus looked at Carias with deep eyes and powerful words: "But has Theonia always been powerful? When you resisted Dionysius When Sri Lanka's army invaded, when you learned that Carthage declared war on you... Didn't the relatively weak Theonia have the same feelings as Athens today! The capital of Theonia, which was founded only a few decades ago, Dare to take risks again and again. Doesn't Athens, which has a glorious history, have the courage?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He paused and then said meaningfully: "In the morning at the Citizens' Assembly, you used Sparta many times to incite the emotions of the citizens of Athens. , but let me tell you the truth, the facts of the past few decades have proved that no matter how tyrannical Sparta is, it will not do much damage to the fundamental interests of Athens. However, the power of Theonia has not yet fully entered the Greek mainland. Athens has been greatly affected. For the independence, freedom and prosperity of Athens, the citizens of Athens have the same courage as they did during the Greco-Persian War!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Karias was silent for a while, then stared at him and said with a little respect. : "Then let us decide the outcome on the battlefield. I hope I can sit down with you to discuss the future of Athens after the war!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After saying that, he bowed slightly and saluted, and then strode out of the city hall.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratos looked at Karias's leaving back, his face suddenly became solemn, he turned to the others and said: "Next, we have to talk to the Persians quickly!"
