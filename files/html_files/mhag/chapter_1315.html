 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos squinted his eyes and looked sharply through the soldiers fighting in front, through the dust and fog, and saw the flags of the King of Persia waving in the wind gradually getting larger in his field of vision. , couldn't help laughing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Artaxerxes ordered all the reserve troops to press forward, his chariot had to follow the large troops and move forward slowly. If he still stayed where he was, the only royal guards left to protect him would be only Thousands of dollars, it was too eye-catching and made him feel very unsafe.

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The driver carefully controlled the four "Nicean horses" carrying the royal carriage (this kind of white horse is produced from the Nicean plain, the most fertile land in the Zagros Valley, and is regarded by the Medes as the finest and tallest horse. The horse was once presented to Assyria as a tribute. The Persian royal family even sanctified it, claiming that the white horse of Nicea was a sacred object given to the Achaemenid royal family by the gods. It could not be used by anyone except Persian officials authorized by the king. Not allowed to be owned privately) followed the reserve troops and headed towards the battlefield where the fierce fighting was taking place.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A somewhat anxious Artaxerxes felt that the advance of the reserve troops was too slow. He was about to give an order to Tribasus to urge the troops in front to speed up the advance, but saw the counselor suddenly restrain him. The war horse put his hands on his forehead and looked up at the sky, while the royal guards beside him also did the same thing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Artaxerxes subconsciously looked at the sky ahead.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, the sun was already heading to the west. Artaxerxes hurriedly raised his eyes. Even with the dust and fog blocking him, he felt that the sun was particularly dazzling. He quickly closed his eyes and was about to open them when he heard Trebasus' panicked voice. Shouted: "Ballista! It's the stone fired by Theonia's ballista!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Artaxerxes was startled, ignoring the stinging eyes, hurriedly opened his eyes and saw a dozen round black The shadow passed quickly above the head, and then there was a roar from behind.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Artaxerxes looked back and saw dust flying about ten meters away from him, and dozens of round stones the size of coconuts had made a dent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Artaxerxes suddenly broke into a cold sweat.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, the Theonians are trying to attack you with ballistae! Hurry! Retreat!" Trebasus urgently asked the carriage to turn around and retreat without the consent of the King of Persia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The king of Persia's luxurious carriage was pulled by "four Nicean horses". It was not only larger than ordinary carriages, but also much heavier. It was not easy to turn quickly, let alone turn around. The carriage was surrounded by royal guards, and it was difficult to clear enough space in a short time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, behind the Theonia infantry formation, a simple three-meter-high sentry tower had been erected at some point. Under the control of the laborers of the engineering battalion, the experienced crossbowmen of the ballista unit were watching. Standing on the sentry tower, looking ahead, and based on the impact point of the first round of stone bullets and the position of the King of Persia's carriage, he quickly corrected the firing data of the ballista, and loudly reported to the ballista unit next to the sentry.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The gunners quickly adjusted the elevation angle of the ballista and the strength of the string pull... Soon, the second round of stone bullets was ejected.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, the carriage Artaxerxes was riding in was still turning around, but he saw dozens of stone bullets roaring down in mid-air.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The first one landed next to the carriage, smashing a royal guard to pieces. Brains and blood even splashed on Artaxerxes' face.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For a moment, Artaxerxes' mind went blank, and he stood blankly, without any reaction to the panicked shouts of the guards.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Boom!" Another stone bullet hit in front of the white horses of Nicea, and the splashed dust hit them. The fertilized white horses realized the danger, struggled to break free from the yoke of the carriage, and did not listen to the driver at all. command.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The carriage shook violently and actually threw the absent-minded Artaxerxes out.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty!!!..." The royal guards rushed to the rescue in panic. At this moment, a stone bullet hit the carriage. Suddenly sawdust flew everywhere and screams were heard everywhere.

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Senior Persian generals all know that ballistae is a siege weapon made by the Theonians, and the siege equipment is very They were rarely used in field battles between armies, so they fell into a blind spot in their thinking. They never expected that the Theonian army would actually use crossbows to attack themselves during the battle, so they entered the range of the crossbows completely unprepared. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, before the war started, Davos ordered 30 ballistas to be deployed behind the center. Although he was lucky enough to use the decapitation tactic, he did not have much hope that it could be realized, because according to Davos As we know, in previous battles, King Artaxerxes of Persia rarely visited the front lines of the battle.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The focus of the ballistae's attack was not on the center, but on the Persian right wing and the reserve army behind Dukiya's troops, to prevent them from providing timely relief to the front.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   According to the Theonian military system, a legion is equipped with 10 ballistas. Therefore, there are nearly 200 ballistas in the army commanded by Davos, 170 of which are concentrated at the rear left wing of the Theonian army. , facing the Dukiya troops, while the Xokant tribe faked defeat, the ballista troops here also erected a sentry tower in time to closely observe the movements of the enemy's reserve troops.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just as the ballistae in the center was aiming at the Persian king's carriage, some of the reserve troops on the right wing had already been bombarded by stone bullets. Because they were anxious for rescue, they entered the range of the ballistae early.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The stone bullets fired by a single ballista actually do not cause much damage, but the concentrated firing of 170 ballistas is not only shocking, but also the killing effect is very terrifying. As long as it falls within a rough range, it can create A small bloody scene of blood and flesh.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The front-line troops deployed by Artaxerxes in the battle were either the elite of the Persian army or the subordinate racial troops with fierce combat effectiveness, while most of the reserve troops had average combat effectiveness, and the Caspian Sea states located behind the Dukiya troops The troops were even reluctant to contribute to Persia. They came here just to take care of some errands, but they were asked by the Persians to come forward urgently for rescue. After being attacked by several rounds of stone bombs, their low morale was gone. , many people fled in panic
  </font>

 <br/>

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While the Persian right-wing messengers went to ask for help from the King of Persia Here, after the soldiers of the Theonian Legion who were fully prepared in advance poured into the gap in the Persian line, they would join the warriors of the Xokant tribe and launch a fierce attack on the Persian archers who rushed to block the gap.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the Persian reserve troops were dispatched, the Persian archers who suffered a large number of casualties had been forced to retreat. Taking advantage of the Persian reinforcements being attacked by crossbows midway and falling into chaos, countless Theonian legionnaires continued to rush through the Persian front. gap, and turned to attack the flanks and rear of Dukiya's army on both sides of the gap.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The already demoralized Dukiya soldiers were attacked from both sides and quickly collapsed.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Some even responded to the Xokant tribe warriors and joined the Theonia side.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the messenger reported the battle situation on the left wing to the command center, there was a burst of laughter. Both the veteran generals and the young staff officers had excited faces, because they knew that the victory was determined.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos also had a smile on his face and asked: "How is the cavalry on both wings doing?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Felicius replied in a loud voice: "Your Majesty, the Persian cavalry has begun to retreat. Our cavalry is reorganizing its formation and preparing to attack the two wings. The enemy's flank launched an attack."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Very good! Very good! Very good!" Davos praised three times in succession, with an even bigger smile on his face. He felt completely relaxed and looked back at these old comrades who were also chatting and laughing. : "The weather is very hot. Are you all thirsty? Heni, give everyone the syrup you brought to drink." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty, drinking syrup is boring. We want to go to the palace of Babylon to drink wine!" Mintas said loudly, jokingly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Hahaha..." Everyone laughed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the soldiers of the Theonian Legion continued to defeat the enemy on the left wing and expand the gap in the enemy's formation, even though the Theonians After defeating the Persian cavalry, the cavalry and light armor soldiers turned to attack the enemy's flanks... The Theonian army has mastered the key to victory, but for a huge battlefield that stretches for more than ten miles, a comprehensive victory will not be easy. Coming soon.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was almost dusk when the Persian army completely collapsed. The last ones fighting to the end were the Persian undead army and the Greek mercenaries in the middle. As a result, they were heavily surrounded and unable to escape.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This great battle caused the elite Persian troops to suffer heavy losses. Senior Persian generals such as Mardonius, Harpurgus, and Pesitidai were either captured or died in battle. The only regret was that Artaxerx The Sith fled the battlefield.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, Davos, who won the battle, issued an order: the cavalry troops continued to pursue the defeated army, and each legion also had to shorten their rest time and speed up their march to Babylon.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, the fastest pursuit was the Numibian light cavalry. They did not have much advantage in the battle with the Scythian cavalry and other light cavalry in the Persian mixed cavalry force. However, because the main force of the Persian cavalry was defeated, The opponents were not interested in fighting and fled one after another, so they began to rest and recuperate in the second half of the battle, so they had more physical strength than other troops.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The furious advance of the Numibian cavalry left the city of Nicephonia, which was not far from the battlefield, lacking adequate defenses. It was forced into the city while containing the defeated troops, and eventually had to surrender.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before entering the city to rest, Davos sent a messenger to the west to tell Leoticides, who was in a hurry: The Theonian army had completely defeated the Persian army, so that he no longer had to lead his army to join them. , but returned to Asia Minor and completely conquered the area.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Early the next morning, the Theonian cavalry troops continued their pursuit eastward and caught up with Artaxerxes and the royal escort by a tributary on the north bank of the Euphrates River.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The king of Persia at this time was completely different from the high-spirited man he had led the mighty army to leave Babylon before. After the army was defeated, the soldiers fled in all directions, and the king's prestige was gone. Even the royal family he trusted most Many soldiers in the escort also took advantage of the darkness to escape, and there were less than 500 people guarding him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After he himself was attacked by a ballista and fell off the carriage, the 60-year-old suffered such a strong impact that he immediately fell into a coma and has not yet regained consciousness. This also slowed down their escape speed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After being overtaken by the Theonian cavalry, Trebassus, who was still following the King of Persia, led the remaining guards and simply chose to surrender, and at the same time demanded that Artaxerxes should be given the courtesy of a king.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos, who arrived later, readily agreed and sent the best medical staff in the army to treat him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   With the King of Persia in hand, the Theonian army's eastward attack went more smoothly. Corsoti, Talmand and other important towns on the banks of the Lati River opened their doors to surrender. In early

  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Davos's army passed through a small village, the veterans in the army became excited because the name of the village was Kunasak.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "We camped here back then! I still remember that the tent I lived in seemed to be in this position!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Over there! Over there is the battlefield! We defeated the King of Persia's left wing with one charge. What a pity, little Cyrus was too reckless, otherwise we should have won that battle..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What a pity! Fortunately he failed, Your Majesty will stand out, lead us to create Theonia, and let Today we can return here as conquerors!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "That's right, we all have to thank Your Majesty! Your Majesty is victorious!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty is victorious!!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the veterans were moved by the scene and sincerely expressed their gratitude to Diver When Si cheered to express his gratitude, Davos, the king of Theonia and the new overlord of the entire Mediterranean, sat motionless on his war horse, like a clay sculpture. He stared at the patch of land in front of where Georgris stood. The empty space was full of emotions: it was there that he was reborn from a Chinese citizen in the 21st century to a lowly mercenary in the ancient Greek era. From the initial struggle to survive to the creation of Theonia, in this He has struggled hard in a strange world for more than 30 years...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, scenes of the past flashed through his mind quickly, like a dream.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Report! Your Majesty, Babylon has opened the city to surrender. Commander Cuchius has led the forward troops into the city!" The shout of the messenger woke up Davos, who was in a daze. He looked around at the soldiers who had begun to cheer, with a look on his face. Slowly a smile bloomed: No, this is not a dream!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is the turbulent ancient Mediterranean world!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And I, Hades Davos, am now the most powerful person in the world!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He waved his right hand vigorously: "Let's go! Let's go to Babylon!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Your Majesty!" Everyone responded in unison. Thousands of soldiers excitedly surrounded the great king and galloped towards the great eastern city that had opened its arms to them...
