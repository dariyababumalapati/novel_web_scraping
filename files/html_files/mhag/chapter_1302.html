   Chapter 1302 Izam's Suggestion
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "…In July, the King of Persia ordered us to break camp and march westward. Because the team was too large and the marching speed was slow, it took us two months to reach Taposakus. At this time, Your Majesty, you have led the army to conquer the Syrian area, so the Persians ordered us to set up camp near Taposakus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to facilitate my quiet departure and future contact, the Xokant tribe army chose Taposakus The northern outskirts serve as a base, not far from Mount Amanus, so one evening half a month ago, I secretly left the camp and headed north into the mountains without being noticed along the way. Afterwards, I made a big circle and finally Come back here..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Izam, this time you risked your life and went deep into the heart of Persia, successfully contacted the Xokant tribe, and persuaded them to support Theonia and make great contributions to the kingdom. On my behalf All the officers and soldiers in the army would like to express their gratitude to you!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos saluted him solemnly, which made Yizam stand up quickly, waved his hands repeatedly, and did not dare to accept the salute: "Your Majesty, as a citizen of Theonia and a senator of the Senate, , this is my duty! And although I have retired, as a member of the former mountain reconnaissance brigade, this is my duty! I cannot deserve the gratitude of your majesty and the entire army!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   These words It was very appropriate, Mariji blinked: You must know that when Izam first started to follow Davos, he was a barbarian who did not understand the etiquette of dignity. After decades of edification in Theonia, especially after retirement, The next few years of life completely changed his character.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Okay, since you still regard yourself as a Theonian soldier, then I will give you a major credit according to the army's reward and punishment system, and then reward you after the war is over." Davos was satisfied with Iza Seeing Mu's performance, a smile appeared on his face, and then asked: "You have been there for so long, do you know how many people there are in the Persian army? What is the composition of their army? How is their combat effectiveness?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a front man of the mountain reconnaissance brigade, Captain, detecting the enemy's situation is what Izam is best at, so he thought for a moment and immediately replied: "Your Majesty, according to my observations during this period, the Persian army stationed in Taposakus is about There are about 350,000 people, of which the Persian army has about 200,000 people, and the rest...like the Dukiya army has 30,000 people, the Tauchia army has about 10,000 people, the Amelia army has about 30,000 people, and the Arabian army has 10,000 people. There were about 5,000 people in Scythia, 10,000 in Kaldan, and more than 10,000 in India... Oh, and they also had more than 20,000 Greek mercenaries.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Among so many armies, there were about 10,000 soldiers guarding the Persian king. The 50,000 to 60,000 Persian troops should be the most capable. Except for the immortal army stationed in Babylon, the others are from the Susa and Persepolis areas in the east..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Artaxerxes personally led The army is out?!" Davos interrupted him and asked a little surprised.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Izam responded quickly: "I'm sorry, Your Majesty! I forgot to mention just now that the Persian king was Taposakus who led the undead army to arrive at the end of last month. Since arriving, he has been staying in the city and has not shown up."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Well..." Davos nodded: "You continue."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "In addition to the 50,000 to 60,000 Persian troops, the Persian army has an advantage over us. It has a huge cavalry, which will separate the cavalry in the affiliated areas. Including all, there are about 30,000 people. In addition, it has more than 50,000 archers. But they do not have powerful heavy infantry! This is the biggest weakness of the Persian army, but the Dukea tribe army, Karl The Danes, Greek mercenaries...the infantry combat effectiveness of these troops is not bad, and they will probably be placed on the first line by the Persians during the battle to confront our legionnaires.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, there are some special units in the Persian army that need to be triggered Let's pay attention. One is the sickle chariot. It is said that the reason why Artaxerxes arrived at Taposacus so late was to prepare more than 200 chariots. I have seen this thing from a distance, and its axle The upper part is equipped with a long and sharp double-sided blade. When the chariot is driving, the blade will keep rotating with the wheels. It is very scary to use it to charge into the battle.

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, there are war elephants, brought by the Indians. There are more than 50 elephants in total. Although I have watched elephants many times at Thurii Zoo, this is the first time I have seen someone using it for combat. The Indians placed a small wooden tower on the back of the elephant, and two people can sit on the tower. , one is a mahout, and the other is an archer. The elephant is huge, and using it to charge into the formation should pose a certain threat to our infantry array. The other

   is the Arab camel soldier. The camel is tall but slow. At first, the Arabs The Arabs' camp was very close to the Amelias, but the Amelias' horses were restless because of the camels. The Persians let the Arabs stay away from the large army and built a camp of their own, but their camels Not many, probably more than 500..."

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Izam paused. Seeing that Davos was silent, he hurriedly said in a more serious tone: "Your Majesty, although the Persian army is huge in number, its origins are too complicated. Apart from the tens of thousands of main troops, I found that most of the other troops were undisciplined, lacked fighting spirit, and lacked effective organization. The various troops did not even understand the language, making it difficult to cooperate well.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I followed Dukya The tribal army's march from Opis to Taposacus was deeply aware of this. In less than an hour after the various troops marched according to the marching route prescribed by the Persians, they lost control and mixed with each other. Scattered across the entire plain... So every day in the afternoon, the entire Persian army had to stop advancing, and then each unit regrouped its soldiers. This took at least two hours, including the Dukea tribe army, and As a result, they often clashed with other troops...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Such a Persian army with no fighting spirit, no discipline, and no unity could not compete with our army, even if we were at a numerical disadvantage. But the Persians also realized this, After all the troops arrived at Taposakus, they began to reorganize all the troops—" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   How did the Persians reorganize?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Davos asked seriously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "For some troops with a small number, such as the Cardans and Arabs, they merged them into the Persian army; for the troops with a larger number, such as the Dukes and Ameri... Ya, they stationed some Persian generals in their army. On the one hand, they were responsible for conveying the orders of the Persian king, and on the other hand, they were responsible for supervising the execution of the orders by the troops. At the same time, these generals were also responsible for training these troops to cooperate with the Persian army... So these days, Persia The army has been seizing the time to train on the plains near Taposakus. Before I left, I felt that the Persian army was in better condition than when it first arrived in Taposakus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty, if we let the Persians continue like this, even if we can win in the end, we will have to pay a heavy price, so -" Izam asked loudly and solemnly: "Your Majesty, we should take advantage of this opportunity. When the Persian army is still relatively loose and not kneaded together, attack it as soon as possible!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos pondered, but did not express his position immediately.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing this, Mariji immediately changed the subject: "Izam, you have spent so much time in the plains of Mesopotamia. What do you think of the attitude of the people there towards the entire Persian army?" "Of
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   course not too much. Okay!" Izam replied with a look of disdain: "The Persian army is not our Theonian army. It is bound by strict military laws. Their affiliated troops come from different regions and different races. Not only are their military disciplines lax, but they also have Some of them also had grudges against the Persians. For example, the Dukea tribe army came to a rich place like Mesopotamia. They looted, destroyed, even raped women and killed people every day. The Persians also organized a group for this purpose. A large number of military law teams came to deal with these disciplinary incidents, and even had several minor conflicts with the affiliated troops.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But even the Persian soldiers themselves were doing these disgusting things, so the towns along the way As soon as they heard that an army was coming, they closed the city gates and refused to let the soldiers enter, even to the Persian army... I heard some rumors that some Mesopotamian nobles intercepted the Persian king on the road several times. He drove the car and complained to the Persian army, but the Persian king did not seem to impose any punishment..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hearing this, Davos asked Mariji with interest: "The residents of the Mesopotamian plains have nothing to do with the Persians. The rule seems a little dissatisfied?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty!" Mariji replied slightly excitedly: "Although Persia has ruled the Mesopotamian plain for more than a hundred years and has always operated it as a core area, so far the Persian residents There is still not a majority in the Mesopotamian plain. The main ethnic groups on this plain are still the Babylonians and Medes, but they have always been submissive to Persia, and Persia treats them almost as equals. Outsiders also regard them as real Persia. part.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But in fact there is a difference between the two! Especially the Babylonians, because they have been ruled by multiple foreign races for hundreds of years, they have become accustomed to being indifferent to wars between countries, as long as they do not infringe on their interests. They would accept whoever would rule the Mesopotamian plains. Therefore, when Cyrus the Younger led his army from Asia Minor into the Mesopotamian plains, almost approaching Babylon, without any obstruction along the way, this may be is an important reason.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I don't know whether Artaxerxes had any resentment about this, but the information obtained from Mazayas shows that he obviously had great support for Susa and Persia during that turbulent period. The Persian nobles in Polis trusted them more and later gave them more power and preferential treatment. They even gave them some land on the Mesopotamian plains. These Persian nobles were in Mesopota. Mia's wanton expansion of territory once caused tension between the nobles and residents of Mesopotamia and the Persians. Although Artaxerxes later realized this problem and mediated, the Mesopotamians were still The dissatisfaction of the Persians will certainly not go away.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty, as long as our army does not harm the people of Mesopotamia after defeating the Persian army, and promises them some benefits, they will definitely regard us as the people of this land. The owners of the land opened their city gates to welcome us!
