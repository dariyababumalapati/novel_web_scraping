   Chapter 883 Special Arrangements for the Third Fleet
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Only a while later, Hernepolis wrote the letter to the Senate and gave it to Davos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After reading it, Davos was satisfied. Without changing a word, he signed his name at the end, stamped it, and returned it to Henepolis: "Send to the Senate in accordance with the highest level of confidentiality."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Your Majesty." Henipolis immediately rolled up the letter skillfully, tied the two ends and the middle of the roll with three red ropes, and then continued to write the second letter.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Martius, the captain of the palace guard, walked into the big tent: "Your Majesty, Midorades, the naval commander of the Third Fleet, is waiting for your summons outside the tent."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Oh, Midorades is here.” Davos hurriedly waved and said, “Let him come in quickly.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After entering the tent, Midorades first performed a military salute, and then said loudly: "Your Majesty, I am late to come back."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “You came at the right time!” Davos said with a pun: “Your fleet and fleet infantry are about to be put to great use!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Midorades heard this, he became excited. As soon as he led the fleet back to Latium, he had already heard that during the short period of his absence, the army led by King Davos, centered on Rome, went north to conquer Viai and Caislera; He conquered Fidenae and Crustaium to the east; he captured Gabi to the south, and forced many Latin city-states to surrender. He drove the Roman army to these small cities near the sea to the west, and was intensifying its attack on them. Siege...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   These news gave him a bad feeling that the Third Fleet was outside this war and completely irrelevant, so when he heard Davos's words, he immediately brightened up.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Have you recruited all your fleet infantry?” Davos asked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Everyone has been recruited, but..." Midorades said cautiously: "As soon as the recruitment order was issued, not only Trina, but also the citizens of towns such as Siliting and Hibernian actively I rushed to the naval base, signed up enthusiastically, and found many acquaintances to intercede... so... so I recruited 2,000 more people..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos looked at him seriously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Methodorad suddenly felt nervous.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos said slowly: "The more recruits, the more recruits will be needed. However, including the newly added fleet infantry establishment this time, the total fleet infantry establishment of the Third Fleet should be 4,000. This is already an exception made by the Ministry of Military Affairs. More Those who come out must be disbanded after the war, remember this will not happen again!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Midorades hurriedly expressed his position: "Your Majesty, please rest assured that as soon as the war is over, I will immediately disband all the extra fleet soldiers!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos smiled slightly: "You... you are competing with the Sixth Army for troops. Be careful that Trotilus (the commander of the Sixth Army) knows about it and will fight you to the death!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Midorades heard the joke made by Davos, he finally breathed a sigh of relief and said jokingly: "In order to calm down Trotilas, I will hold a few more banquets for him and get him drunk. ." The military camp of the Sixth Army is to the west of Silitium, and the naval base of the Third Fleet is in the bay near Trina. The two are not far apart, and they often have frequent exchanges. Midorades and Trotilas The relationship with him is not bad, so he is not worried that the other party will blame him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Midolades." Tormid suddenly said: "The current establishment of the fleet infantry of the Third Fleet is 4,000 people. We will prepare rations and other material supplements for your subordinate fleet infantry according to this establishment. The extra With 2,000 people, you have to figure it out on your own.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What? ! Midorades thought Tormid was joking, but when he saw his serious face, he didn't know what to say. After all, when he recruited soldiers this time, he did have selfish motives. Thormid was accepting this. After receiving a hint from Davos, Midorades was given a small warning.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But for Midorades, it was simply impossible for him to come up with the baggage to supply 2,000 people. He could only look at Davos for help.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos took advantage of the situation and took over the conversation, and said seriously: "If you want to provide for the two thousand extra people you have, then you can only do your best to complete the next task given to you."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Your Majesty, my brothers in the Third Fleet and I are fully prepared, and no matter how difficult the task is, we will successfully complete it!” Midorades immediately expressed his position loudly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since Henepolis was writing a letter, Crotocataxus took over his job. He knew Davos's plan, so he found the map from the bookshelf and spread it out on the table.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos led Midorades to the table.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Medorades looked down: before him was a map of Corsica and Sardinia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “How much do you know about Corsica?” Davers asked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Midorades had already made a calculation in his mind. He thought about it carefully and then said: "Corsica is called a giant mountain in the sea by sailors. The island is almost entirely made up of towering mountains and is not suitable for living at all. There are only two small coastal flats on the east side of the island, with two towns built on them. The northern town Mariana belongs to the Etruscans, and the southern town Alenia belongs to the Philippines. Nike. In addition, there are some small Phoenician villages on the west coast. However, the offshore reefs on the west coast are densely covered with rocks and the coast is tortuous. It will be more difficult for warships to land... Your Majesty, you want the third fleet to attack Kota Kinabalu. Signia?”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos nodded, looked at the map and said: "To be precise, let the third fleet attack the Phoenician towns and settlements on Corsica. The reason why Carthage can become the most prosperous and prosperous in the Western Mediterranean The richest city-state, the most important reason is that it controls most of the precious metal resources and trade in the entire Western Mediterranean, including the Iberian Peninsula, Gaul, Etruria, Sardinia and Corsi. Carthage, especially Sardinia and Corsica, is completely controlled by Carthage. Since Carthage dares to declare war on our Dionia, then we will destroy this important source of trade one by one. Its treasury is no longer full and cannot support a long-term war with us.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hence, the next first attack goal of the Third Fleet is to destroy all Phoenician settlements on Corsica. Don’t underestimate the small size and population of these settlements, but the silver, iron, copper and other metal minerals on Corsica were excavated, smelted, manufactured and finally transported to Carthage through them. The entire west coast The Phoenician settlements have formed a complete metal smelting system among themselves. So your third fleet is going to occupy these settlements and capture all the Phoenicians..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Also, try not to damage the Phoenician metal mines and smelting facilities!” Davers emphasized.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing this, Midorades immediately said solemnly: "Your Majesty, the Third Fleet will overcome all difficulties and complete this mission."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Not only must it be completed, but it must be completed as soon as possible! Of course, we must also be careful of attacks from Carthage’s warships stationed in Sardinia and Corsica. Don’t be careless!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes!" Davos's stern words made Midorades feel shocked. As the naval commander responsible for defending the west coast of Dionia, he certainly had some knowledge of the situation in Sardinia and Corsica to the west of the west coast. A more detailed understanding: Before the war, Carthage stationed no more than 30 tri-propeller warships on these two islands, and they were mainly scattered in several towns and ports in Sardinia. It may be precisely because of its excessive strength. Weak, during the Dionian army's expedition to Rome, they did not come out to cause trouble, so Midorades did not take them to heart, but Daves' warning forced him to pay attention.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos pressed the icon of Alenia on the map with his hand and asked again: "Although Alenia is a Phoenician town, do you feel that this name does not match Phoenicia or Carcass?" The Taiki custom of naming towns?”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Could it have been a town belonging to the Greeks?" Midorades repeatedly chanted the name of the town silently, and then asked a question with a slight surprise. In fact, this was just an expression deliberately displayed to respond to Davos, As a Dionian general who traveled across the sea, he didn't care about the past history of this town.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You are right, but Alenia was not just a Greek city-state. Logically speaking, it should be a town belonging to Dionia!" Henipolis interjected, and he had already finished writing to The letter between Alexis and Xantiparis happened to hear this conversation, and the disciple of the historian Ansitanus immediately became interested in being a teacher.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Alenia should belong to Dionia?!” Midorades was really surprised now.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “During the great colonial era, we Greeks colonized the Western Mediterranean, not only establishing Agrigento and Syracuse in Sicily; we established Tarantum and Sybari in Magna Graecia; we also established in Gaul Masseria was established; Naples and Cumae were established in Campania; Alenia was also established on the island of Corsica...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But the Etruscans, the masters of northern Italy at that time, were frightened by the surging Greeks. They may have thought that if they did not stop the crazy colonial behavior of the Greeks, the Etruscans would probably be in the same position as our Greeks. Surrounded by the colonial city. As a result, they united with Carthage, which had already established a foothold in Sardinia, and went to war with the Greek city-states of Alenia, Masselia, and Campania.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The most important battle was a naval battle that took place near Alenia. As a result, the Greeks suffered a disastrous defeat. Not only did Alenia be captured by the Carthaginians, but they also did not dare to colonize northern Italy for hundreds of years. …”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hinepolis was talking incessantly. Not only Midorades was listening carefully, but Thormedes and Clotocathax were also listening with interest.
