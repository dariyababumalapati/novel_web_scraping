   Chapter 859 Counter-siege
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Usibik is right, this is our mountainous area. At night, we are the hunting wolves, and the Dionians will only become our prey!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “That’s right, let’s do it!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The leaders agreed one after another and finally reached a consensus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   50 meters away from the Dionian army formation, nearly 7,000 Samoni warriors began to line up in an extremely loose formation around its west and north sides. Some warriors even lay down in the grass. middle.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alexis saw this situation in the formation, and had no urge to let the soldiers launch an assault, because he knew that once the soldiers started to charge, these seemingly lazy Samnites would run as fast as rabbits, Lure the soldiers into the mountains and it would be a disaster.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a result, the two sides were facing each other face to face with a distance of tens of meters apart, and time was passing by little by little.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Samnite people are confident, but the Dionysian soldiers are getting more and more panicked as they move back. After all, this is a strange land for them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Each captain asked Alexis for instructions: Do you want to retreat?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He was firmly rejected by Alexis.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The adjutant Umattheus was standing aside and couldn't help but said: "Your Majesty Commander, this is the first time we are fighting together with the Abenirum people. I feel-"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I don't trust the Abenirum people very much." Alexis interrupted him and said in a deep voice: "But I trust Polet more, and what reassures me the most is that Zantiparis is here. Since he has agreed to this plan, he will definitely implement it with all his strength!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Umattheus stopped talking. He knew why Alexis said these words, because Alexis fought side by side with Pollet in the South Italian War. More importantly, Alexis and Zanti Paris was a mercenary who went on an expedition to Persia. They had a deep friendship and trust in each other.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, as the sun in the sky gradually shifted to the west, the surroundings were still calm, and the expression on Alexis's face gradually became solemn...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Finally, he couldn't help but said to Umattheus: "Go and call those Abenirumites quickly!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Dionian army always stayed in place, which confused the Samnite leaders.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Aren’t these Dionians worried that they will have no place to sleep when the night comes?” Usibik couldn’t help but muttered.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Perhaps the Dionysians thought we would retreat before night came, so they were competing with us to see who could be more patient." A leader laughed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I think they are waiting for reinforcements from their military camp in the River Bend, but no matter how many Dionians come, it will be dark when they get here, and they will all become our prey by then." Another leader said confidently said.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Reinforcements? Usibik's heart moved and he quickly asked the leaders of Shirpini: "What's unusual about Abenirum these days?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Abnormal? As usual, they sent a group of soldiers to stand on the border to threaten us as soon as they saw our people driving cattle and sheep near their territory. But once our soldiers rushed over, these cowards would Ran away... If we weren't at war with Dionia, we really wanted Chief Lesguk to lead us in the fight!" A leader from Beneventum said disdainfully.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Another Shirpini leader understood Usibik's words and said: "Are you suspecting that Abenirum has defected to Dionia? Don't worry, even if Gairni is a bastard, It is impossible for him to throw javelins at his own people, and he also swore an oath in the name of Savoni in front of the high priest, and it is impossible to break it! Besides, the big leader Lesguk specially sent spies to be in Abe every day. Nirom is keeping an eye on the outside of the territory. If there is any abnormality, I’m afraid he would have come and informed us by now.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, don't worry, Usibik. Even if the Shirpini tribe has conflicts again, they will not kill each other." Several Shirpini leaders immediately agreed, and one leader even He said sympathetically: "To be honest, the big leader was too harsh on Abenirum. It is indeed not easy for Garni these years."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The leader of Beneventum looked a little ugly, and Usibik's expression became a little gloomy. He was suspicious: These Shirpini leaders were secretly mocking the great leader of Kawutini, Ser. Govani used a trick to trap Quinduk and conquer Naconia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The atmosphere suddenly became a little quiet. The leaders of the other two tribes saw Usibik's ugly face and were about to say something to resolve the embarrassment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Suddenly, a spy hurried down from the mountains to the west: "Everyone... Leaders, it's not good!... An army appeared in the south... There are many, many soldiers, and they are rushing here. Come!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The leaders were shocked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Where did the army come from?!" Usibik asked urgently, because the south the spy pointed to did not point to the direction of the Reach, but to the west of the Reach, southwest of this mountain range. , as far as he knew, there were no tribes or towns there.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I...I don't know, because what they wear is neither red (the Samonite people often wear red singlets) nor black, but black and yellow." The spy said a little guilty. He was just walking on the mountain. When he saw it from a distance, he hurried over to report it, but did not rush over to investigate carefully.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Black and yellow?..." A Shirpini leader suddenly said: "Could they be Potentians?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone was shocked when they heard this. They all knew that there was a plant in the Lucania area that could produce yellow dye, so in the past Lucania warriors mostly wore yellow uniforms to fight. Could it be them?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the South Italian War, the Potentians have not participated in any battles. The Samnite leaders still have the impression that they plundered the territory of Potentia more than ten years ago and almost killed them. Genocide. Since the Lucania region has been merged into the Kingdom of Dionia, after the war began, not only the leaders of each tribe, but even they subconsciously regarded Potentia as part of Dionia and ignored it. It actually exists independently as a free city.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Urgent situation! Usibik didn't have time to find out where this army came from. He only knew that it could never be the army of the Samonai Tribal Alliance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now how to do? ! Retreat immediately? ! The anxious Usibik looked at the panicked leaders, then looked at the surrounded Dionian army in front, and realized that he had to make a decision quickly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But before he could make up his mind, a loud bugle sounded from the southwest, and then a powerful bugle sounded from the northwest.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "...General, with such a large-scale army dispatch, it is impossible for them to hide it from our spies. The leader of Garni will definitely unite with the Potentians to attack here -" Ah, who was wearing Dionysian clothes. Guide Benilum was trying hard to explain to Alexis when he suddenly heard the sound of a military bugle from the west, and then heard the sound of a bugle again. His face was filled with joy: "Here they come! Our soldiers are here! ... "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, Alexis, who heard the sound of the bugle, did not listen to him anymore. Instead, he immediately said to Eumattheus: "Quickly order the light armored soldiers to attack! The other groups will attack later!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Umattheus was startled: "Commander, our reinforcements have not arrived yet. Should we wait a little longer?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “If you wait any longer, the enemy will run away!” Alexis said without hesitation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   By the time the bugle sounded, the leaders of Samonei had already understood that they had been fooled by the Dionysians. Retreat was an undoubted problem, but such a large army must retreat in unison, otherwise it would be easy to retreat. It turned into a rout, and which direction to retreat is also a question: there are Dionian troops in the east, and large groups of enemies are coming from the northwest and southwest. Since the mountains to the north are steep and difficult to climb, it seems that only the south is still alive. It is safer, but the south leads to the Ofanto River. Who knows if the Dionians have an ambush there?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The situation was urgent, and the leaders quickly reached an agreement: before the enemy's reinforcements had fully arrived, they should immediately forcefully retreat due west.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the leaders were about to quickly run back to their own teams, Dionia's shield formation suddenly opened many gaps, and 2,000 light armored soldiers rushed out, holding leather shield daggers, and killed the Samonite warriors. Come.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The confrontation between the two sides lasted for more than three hours, especially the Dionians' stance of holding on, which gradually eroded the fighting spirit of the Samoni warriors. Many Samoni warriors were already lying on the ground basking in the sun. , only because he heard the bugle sound from the west, he was called out by his companions. Before he could stretch his body, he saw the Dionian soldiers on the opposite side rushing towards them like hungry beasts, with ferocious faces. The distance of more than 50 meters was too short. Many Samnite soldiers who had been relaxing for a long time had no time to retreat before the Dionian soldiers rushed in front of them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Until this time, Alexis asked the trumpeter to blow the attack bugle.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The assault of the Dionian light armor disrupted the already loose formation of the Samnite coalition. Some warriors were retreating, while others were fighting with the Dionian soldiers. The whole scene became a bit chaotic.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Originally, Usibik wanted to wait for the leaders to organize their troops and retreat together. Now he had no choice but to order the horn to sound the retreat.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as the horn sounded, the remaining fighting spirit of the Samnite warriors was gone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Run west! Follow me and run west!..." The leaders shouted hysterically, leading the surrounding warriors to retreat towards the mountains behind them. They wanted to take advantage of the fact that the Dionian soldiers were not good at climbing in the mountains. shortcomings to throw off the enemy's pursuit.
