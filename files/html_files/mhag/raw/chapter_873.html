   Chapter 873 Attacking Lola (1)
  </font>
 </font>

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, the administrative officials of Enona effectively managed a large team of more than 20,000 elderly people, teenagers, and even women, divided into several groups. Some people neatened the cut trees, carried them down the mountain, and placed them at the place where the military camp engineer planned to build the earth hill; others piled the wood in a criss-cross pattern and gradually extended it upward toward the city wall; In addition, there was a group of people who carried baskets of excavated soil, filled it into a base made of wood, and tamped it down.

   The defenders of Lola saw such a big movement from the enemy on the south wall. They were shocked and a little curious, but soon they discovered that in front of them, a mound about 50 meters wide was rising from the ground. It rose up and quickly approached the city head, and the entire wooden fence was also moving forward.

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is not that the Lola defenders did not launch long-range attacks at the enemies who were making mounds under the city, but the javelins and arrows they threw were either blocked by the wooden fence or blocked by the shields of the heavy infantry behind the wooden fence. Although there were also a few He was injured and fell to the ground, but this did not scare the coalition people. Whether they were Campanians or Naconians, they were deeply poisoned by the Samnites and hated them. The Enona people assisted in the battle. It will be recorded by the household registration official, which will be of great help to the future development of the family in the kingdom, so they devoted themselves to this project with great enthusiasm.

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The defenders of Lola had no choice but to venture out of the city several times for raids in an attempt to destroy the wooden fence and mounds. However, they were repelled by the army led by Zantiparis, who had been prepared for it. Not only did they not succeed, but they also destroyed the few people. The defenders suffered considerable losses.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The defenders of Lola could only watch helplessly as the mound got closer and higher. Not only was it approaching the trench, but its highest height was almost as high as the city head.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Zantiparis no longer needed the wooden fence, but directly sent more than a thousand Dionian heavy infantry and light infantry to stand on the hill and shoot at the defenders from a distance of more than ten meters.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although both sides suffered a lot of casualties, the Lola defenders, whose number of soldiers was only one-tenth of the opponent's, could not bear this kind of consumption. They had to send messengers many times to the big leader Segovani for urgent help.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Regarding Zantiparis's decision to "attack the city of Lola today", Aialos, the general of the Campania League, hesitated. He said: "The earth mountain we built is not close to the city wall yet. At this time, the attack will be difficult." It’s not too hasty, do you want to wait another day?”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Zantiparis patiently explained to him: "Our Majesty Davos once said something to the senior generals of the Kingdom of Dionia. He said, 'When fighting a powerful enemy, don't act rashly. When seeking a decisive battle, we must carefully look for opportunities. However, once we win an important victory or the enemy reveals obvious flaws, we must attack continuously and quickly, not giving the enemy a chance to breathe, and completely disrupting the enemy's entire deployment... …',
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now the main force of the Samnite coalition has been attracted to Beneventum. There are only more than 1,000 enemies stationed in Lola and Sesala. They thought they could defend for a long time with this small number of people, but they obviously underestimated us, Dio. With Leah's siege ability, we should quickly capture Lola City before they can react, making the entire battle situation more favorable to us.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, the situation on the battlefield is rapidly changing. So far we have been blessed by the gods. The weather has been pretty good in the past few days, and it looks like it will be a sunny day today. But if it suddenly rains heavily tomorrow, it is very likely that our mountains will be washed away and the soldiers and people will be almost at risk. All Tian's hard work has been in vain, and the key point is that it has delayed the opportunity to fight, so we should seize the time to attack while Hades is still protecting us! ...Well, and...according to our usual experience in siege training, when Tushan is approaching the city wall, which is also the most difficult time, the enemy's defense will only become tighter. In order to speed up the progress and reduce the casualties of the people, we We must rely on violent attacks to force them to reduce their attack on Tushan so that our siege can be completed faster..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Zantiparis' serious explanation convinced the generals of the Campania League, and everyone agreed to launch an attack on Lola City today. The next step was to discuss the attack plan.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Zantiparis has already considered this: "The southern city wall of Lola is where the earth mountain is located and is the focus of the attack. I suggest using a heavy infantry brigade and a light infantry brigade from Dionia, plus your Campa Niah’s 1,000 light infantry and 1,000 heavy infantry, a total of 4,000 people, focus on attacking here!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Aialos nodded and said: "I agree with General Zantiparis. These two thousand Campanian soldiers are sent by us from Naples."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Zantiparis continued: "I suggest that the siege equipment made in the past few days are used to attack the Lorasi city wall. Since our Dionian soldiers can skillfully use these equipment, a Dionian soldier The heavy infantry brigade is responsible for the main attack, and an additional 1,000 Campania soldiers are added as auxiliary... The east and north walls also need to be arranged with 2,000 soldiers each using long ladders to attack the city, so as to disperse the few in Lola City. The enemy, weakening their defense capabilities... In the end, there is only one Dionysian light infantry group and 1,000 Campanian soldiers left, and I recommend that they be used as reserves for the final assault."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as Zantiparis finished speaking, Aialos said: "I think General Zantiparis's plan is very good. Naples is willing to send 1,000 soldiers to attack the west wall, and another 1,000 Naples soldiers to attack the north. The remaining 1,000 Naples soldiers will be kept as reserves according to what General Xantiparis said, and the remaining vacancies will be filled by soldiers from your city-state." Aialos spoke with respect to Xantiparis, And when he spoke to the other generals of the Campania allies, he had a somewhat commanding tone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Only then did Zantiparis suddenly realize that Naples was the leader of the Campania League. As a military general, he did not think too much about it. Instead, he felt that with Aialos in charge of these Campania city-state generals, the province It saved him a lot of trouble and a lot of time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Once the plan is finalized, implementation begins immediately.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The first to take action were the coalition soldiers outside Lora South City. This is because the people are already prepared. Each of them is carrying sacks filled with soil, preparing to complete the final closing of the soil mountain and the city wall. Of course, this is also the most difficult moment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is said to be an earth mountain, but in fact it is a large sloping causeway. According to the design of Dionia engineers, its starting slope is only about 20 degrees, which is relatively gentle and extends from 40 meters away to the city wall. Due to the use of wood as a The support has rammed earth as flesh and blood. Many soldiers step on it, so it will neither slip nor collapse.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   More than 200 Dionysian heavy infantrymen held a long shield in each hand, climbed the mountain in two rows, and advanced towards the city wall.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The defenders immediately launched long-range attacks against them, mainly javelins.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Dionian soldiers' double-sided shields protected themselves tightly, but even so, some soldiers were still wounded by javelins that penetrated the long shields. Behind them, new heavy infantry moved forward to fill the gaps in the array at any time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The light infantry following the Dionian heavy infantry also attacked the city head. They not only threw javelins, but also threw arrows. After all, the city defenders were not as thick as the Dionian heavy infantry. For protection, although some of their warriors wear armor, at least half are light infantry, and bows and arrows can cause damage to them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The heavy infantrymen reached the top of the mountain, squatted down, and raised their long double-sided shields to form a closely arranged shield wall. Its height was almost the same as the opposite city wall, and the distance between the two sides was less than ten meters. The defenders at the top of the city The attack was naturally more violent, and the Dionian light infantry's counterattack was equally fierce, because they had to suppress the attack on the city head and protect the safety of their comrades.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Within a distance of ten meters, javelins and arrows kept passing by each other, so densely that they occasionally collided in the air. There were constant screams from both sides, and some soldiers fell to the ground injured.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On both sides of the mountain, 1,000 Campanian light infantry took advantage of the defender's attention being attracted by the mountain and quickly approached the ditch. They launched an attack on the enemies at the top of the city to relieve the pressure on the friendly forces on the mountain. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, people carrying earth bags lined up in columns, bent their heads and ran quickly to the top of the mountain, risking being hit by incoming javelins and arrows.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is a gap of one person between each Dionian heavy infantry and heavy infantry, and between light infantry and light infantry on the top of the mountain, thus forming passages that can go directly to the top of the mountain. When the people arrived at the shield wall, the heavy infantrymen on both sides would raise the long shields with both hands higher, exposing a certain gap below, which was just enough for the people to push the earth bags down the mountain, and then the empty-handed people would turn back and run back down the mountain.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Countless earth bags continued to roll down into the "valley" formed between the city wall and the earth mountain. The occasionally injured Dionian soldiers and Lola defenders fell into the valley, and before they had time to climb out, they were quickly covered by the earth bags. Buried, it became a cornerstone of this man-made earth mountain.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not only did the people go up and down the mountain, but the Dionian light infantry and heavy infantry also rotated continuously due to physical strength, injuries, and the replenishment of javelins and arrows. Under the mountain, the medical battalion was rapidly treating the injured people. and soldiers for emergency rescue.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Such a busy but relatively orderly tense scene was reflected in the eyes of Aialos, the Naples commander in the rear. He couldn't help but sigh: The Dionians turned a tragic siege into an orderly one. , Lively and efficient construction projects, this is not something that any Greek city-state can do. The military capabilities of the Kingdom of Dionia are too terrifying!
