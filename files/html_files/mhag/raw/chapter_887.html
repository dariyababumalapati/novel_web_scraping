   Chapter 887 Landing in Sicily (2)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If it was more than 10 years ago, the laborers at Lilibi Port were more Greek free people and there were very few Numibian slaves. However, the Kingdom of Dionia occupied eastern Sicily and absorbed Greek free people and Carthage. The conquest of Numbia changed this situation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Braving the continuous drizzle and the cold and humid sea breeze, the workers rushed to the dock shaking their heads. It was still daybreak, and although the port was open, no ships had come in yet. The workers took the opportunity to squat under the eaves of the warehouse on the shore and seize the time to rest.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not long after, they heard noisy footsteps. Hundreds of Carthaginian soldiers poured into the port, began to drive away the idle people in the port, and strengthened patrols on the dock.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Looking at the dock that suddenly became heavily guarded, the workers felt shocked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Look! The Lord of Imisele City is here!” Someone shouted in surprise, and the surrounding atmosphere became even more tense.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, the official in charge of labor management ran over and cursed angrily: "Get up, lazy guys! Before Lord Mago leads the army to the port, you should immediately clear all the obstacles and garbage at the dock to ensure the smoothness of the road. Smooth and clean! Also take those dilapidated boats docked at the pier away for me immediately! Quick! Quick! If anyone is lazy, I will let them know how powerful I am!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   With the roar of the officials, the supervisors swung their whips and the workers immediately ran towards the dock like frightened rabbits under the leadership of the foreman.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   One of them was a stooped middle-aged laborer, whose dull eyes were now gleaming: The Carthaginian army actually chose to cross the sea and land at Lilibi in such a climate. How bold it was! I wonder if Flarios sent a clipper to detect this enemy action? !
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   About an hour later, the first troop transport ship entered the Port of Lilibi. The sailors on the ship had already furled the sails. They shouted the trumpet, rowed the oars, and sailed to the pier closest to them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then the second and third ships sailed...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Soon, the sea surface of the port was covered with troop transport ships.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing a ship approaching the trestle, the foreman led a dozen workers to run over quickly, hooked the side of the ship with a hand-held iron hook, and made one side of it completely close to the trestle, and then tied the cables on the ship to the wooden piles. Then put up planks and let the soldiers disembark.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This procedure that workers are usually very skilled in helping to dock ships has become a bit difficult under the cold wind and drizzle, because the trestle has become slippery and the ship has to use greater force under the agitation of the waves. It took a lot of strength to pull it. It became a very common phenomenon for workers to keep slipping on the trestle and falling into the sea. It was even not uncommon for ships to collide in the port and soldiers to fall into the water...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Imisele made some preparations for the landing of the army, chaos at the port still inevitably occurred and continued...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, no matter how chaotic the Lilibi Port was, soldiers still boarded the dock one after another, and gathered densely on the shore of the port. Amidst the noise and noise, they lined up in columns and left the port one after another. Entering the city of Lilibi...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the eyes of the stooped middle-aged laborer: the first people to come ashore should be Carthaginian soldiers (actually they are more Phoenicians), but these rumored delicate Carthaginians appear to be very calm. , there was little noise and confusion during the entire process of landing, and they obeyed the command of the team officer very much; there were also many dark-skinned and slender Numibian soldiers (actually some Mauritanians among them) who came ashore later. During the landing process, these rumored free-spirited nomads were actually able to obey orders and assemble relatively quickly ashore; of course, there were also soldiers who acted sloppily. These bare-chested, ferocious-looking natives with strange tattoos were said to be Although the Celts from the Iberian Peninsula were not used to riding in boats, they were tossed and vomited by the rough waves. They were all staggering and pale when they came ashore, but their tall and strong bodies still made him feel nervous. What concerned this worker most was the murderous aura exuded by these soldiers, which only veterans who have been on the battlefield for a long time can possess.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It seems that Carthage’s army is not easy to deal with this time! He looked at the troop transport ships that were still coming in and out of the harbor entrance, hiding his worries in his heart...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In this landing, Mago arranged the landing site of the main Iberian force that had followed him for many years in and around the port of Lilibi. In fact, the entire Carthaginian army-an army of more than 80,000 people The landing sites are all over the entire coast from Mazara to Elyx. There are not only the ports of various towns, but also beaches where ships can dock, because Mago hopes to be able to land soldiers, baggage, horses, etc. in the shortest possible time. After being sent to Sicily to avoid being discovered by the Dionians, he was attacked by their fleet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For this purpose, not only Carthage and Utica dispatched a large number of ships, but also hadrumetum, ruspina, lgilgili... and other ships located on the African coast. The city-states of Feniki also provided ships to help transport soldiers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, the entire sea area from western Sicily to Africa can see a strange scene: countless ships cover the sea surface, as if laying out a huge pontoon bridge connecting the two places. And along the western coast of Sicily, you can see exhausted soldiers gathering on the beach everywhere, frightened horses running around, shouts and horse neighs coming and going, from Mazara to Elyx...

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the palace of the city lord in Selinus, the adjutant Muklu gently opened the door of the study. Sitting alone in the room was Leonticides, the commander of the Kingdom of Dionia in charge of the Sicilian war. He sat motionless on a wooden chair like a puppet, staring attentively at the map of Sicily hanging on the wall.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Having followed Leotizides for some time, Muklu knew some of the commander's weird habits, so he did not speak, but stood quietly behind Leotizides.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I don’t know how long it took, Muklu felt his eyelids were fighting, and suddenly heard Leotizides ask: "Yesterday, the Iberian army of about 20,000 people who had been entrenched in Palermos suddenly attacked. Marching south and entering the city of Lilibi, what do you think is the reason?”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Uh... maybe it has something to do with the fact that Mago, the Iberian governor of Carthage, took office as the military commander, and the conflict between the Iberian army and the Carthaginian army no longer existed..." When asked about this suddenly, Muklu failed to respond. After thinking deeply, I came up with a reason that I thought was reasonable.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leotizides did not look back, still sitting upright, and continued to ask: "It has been a long time since Mago became the military commander of Carthage. Why did the Iberian army in Palermos until yesterday?" Did you just set out to enter Lilibi?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Muklu heard a hint of dissatisfaction in Leotizides's words. This time he thought for a while before cautiously answering: "It may be because we have been sending soldiers to harvest Mazara during this period. , Segesta, Lilibi, and even the half-ripe wheat fields outside the city such as Elyx. The Iberian army came from the north coast, probably to strengthen the Carthaginians’ military power here and prevent us from harvesting wheat. Action..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Muklu said these words, seeing that Leotizides did not respond, he thought for a while and added very uncertainly: "It may also be... cooperating with the Carthaginians' military operations..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a while, Leotizides replied faintly: "Carthage's military operation?... In addition to landing in Sicily, what else can they do?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tagru was suddenly shocked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Leotizides stood up, looked at Muklu, and said in a deep voice: "Go and inform the cavalry corps to send me the best scouts. In the past few days, let me carefully explore Lilibi, E Lyx... report any abnormal movements of the enemies in these cities immediately!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes!" Muklu responded in a low voice, because he knew: From now on, compared with the Carthaginian army, the only weakness of the Dionysian army is the cavalry. This order of the commander determines the fourth The cavalry regiment must pay a certain amount of casualties.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "...At the same time, send five reserve brigades to follow these scouts to protect our scouts from being attacked by the Numibian cavalry." Leotizides' next words made Muklu relaxed. At the same time, with the backing of 5,000 legion reserve heavy infantry, the safety of the Dionia reconnaissance cavalry is guaranteed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Also, tell Miltias to send more clippers deeper into the sea further west of Sicily to detect the movements of the Carthaginian army on the other side of the sea.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Leotizides finished speaking, Muklu looked embarrassed and said: "Commander, I came to the study just to tell you that our fleet still did not send any warships like yesterday. Go sailing in the western waters. According to the information I found, Miltias, the commander of the Sicilian fleet, said to his admirals, "They are not familiar with the sea conditions here. If they go to sea in such bad weather, they are likely to encounter them again." Like the previous misfortune, he must be responsible for the lives of the crew of each warship. He cannot let them die in vain without gaining any military merit. And in such weather, the Carthaginians are also worried , there will be no big action...'"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Listening to what Mukru said, Leotizides' face was terrifyingly gloomy. He snorted softly: "This new Sicilian fleet commander has been frightened by the storm. He is more courageous than Szekeli." It’s much worse! You still have to go to the port and tell Miltias personally that it’s my order that he must send clippers to patrol the western waters of Sicily in the next two days!”
