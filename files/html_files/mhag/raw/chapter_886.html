   Therefore, Servius rushed to find Licinius, partly to remedy the situation, and partly to shirk the blame. However, he did not expect that Licinius would not spare any mercy and would accuse him of his mistakes in public. Listing them out one by one, this made Servius extremely angry, but he couldn't find any reason to refute. His face turned red, and he finally yelled: "You despicable civilian! Most of the civilians in the army fled and surrendered. Dionians, are you still here to be a spy? The dictator should have arrested you long ago! You civilians are not trustworthy at all!..."

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as this statement came out, the people around him were in an uproar.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Servius saw that the situation was not good and immediately left quickly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Damn it!” Licinius stared at Servius’s leaving figure, his expression gloomy and terrifying.

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The more than ten-mile stretch of coast from Carthage to Utica has now turned into a huge military camp. Thousands of citizens from Carthage and Phoenician city-states, and indigenous people from the Iberian Peninsula , nomads from Numbia, and even indigenous people from Mauritania and Gaul gradually gathered here. Races with different appearances wore various costumes and spoke completely different words. It was very lively, as if this place had become a the center of the entire Mediterranean world.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But for the senators of the Carthage Senate, this huge military camp next to the city of Carthage is a potentially terrible threat: multiple races gather here, and due to language barriers, poor communication, and customs and habits Different people have different interests and needs, and conflicts occur every day. Carthaginian and Phoenician people living outside the city also go to the Senate to complain from time to time and are harassed by the indigenous people. Fortunately, Mago led his generals around and settled many disputes. In addition, every day such a large army stays here will consume a lot of food and wages...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, the senators wanted to send this terrible army to Sicily immediately to harm the Dionians, so they sent people every day to urge Mago to lead the army to land in Sicily as soon as possible.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For Mago, he didn't want to land in Sicily as soon as possible. After all, he was busy resolving these disputes every day, which also gave him a headache. In the long run, if these unruly mercenaries ruined the image of the Magonides family among the people of Carthage, it would be more than worth the loss. However, since the Carthage fleet was destroyed by the storm, new warships are still under construction, and Dionia's warships often cruise in the waters of western Sicily, attacking merchant ships from Carthage and its allies heading to Sicily, threatening The sea route between Carthage and Sicily was connected, so without the protection of the fleet, how could Mago dare to let the soldiers take cargo ships, cross the ocean, and land in Sicily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The African coast, which has always been sunny and hot, finally started to rain continuously on this day, and there was also a strong sea breeze. The temperature finally dropped. The soldiers who had been enduring the scorching heat ran out of their tents one after another, enjoying this rare opportunity. It was so cool that even the natives from Iberia took off their clothes one after another, washed their whole bodies with the rain, and yelled excitedly. Their sturdy bodies and ferocious looks made no one dare to cast a shadow on them. A look of contempt.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Mago also walked out of the Chinese army's tent. He looked at the big flag standing in front of the tent and was in a daze: blown by the sea breeze, the flag was fluttering toward the northeast.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Annobas came towards me.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   During the battle with the Dionian fleet, the storm also destroyed the two-headed dragon ship on which the Carthaginian naval commander was riding. He was pushed to the coast of Mazara by the rough waves and was finally rescued. But he was soon ordered to return to Carthage to be questioned by the Senate, who wanted to hold him accountable for causing the annihilation of the Carthaginian fleet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Fortunately, Hanno secretly instigated Taipan Laco, Okriton and other senators to excuse him, claiming that the Dionian fleet had more warships and was more powerful. Although Annobas caused heavy losses to his own warships, But he also used the storm to destroy the opponent's fleet and ensure the safety of Carthage and the western waters of Sicily. His merits outweighed his faults! …
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, instead of being punished, he continued to serve as the commander of the Carthaginian navy, but now he was in name only.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, this resolution of the Carthage Senate occurred within a few days after the naval battle. If it were now, the senators would never easily spare Annobas. After all, the Dionian warships continued to attack Carthage. The show of force in the waters of western Sicily that Carthage once controlled caused heavy damage to Carthage's sea trade, making Annobas' previous statement that "the Dionian fleet was also completely destroyed" become a lie.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, the Senate and Mago later reached a consensus: Annobas and the Carthaginian fleet led by Mago would be under the direct command of Mago. This was originally in line with Hanno's "Army under Mago's command and the navy under Mago's command." The proposal of "Commander Nobas" is very different, which shows the anger of the Carthaginian people towards Annobus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Lord Mago!” Annobas walked closer and saluted respectfully. The huge criticism and accusations he received during this period made him cautious.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “What did the Tyrians say?” Mago asked directly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The Tyrians...refuse to provide escort for our landing fleet..." Annobas said softly: "They also said...they will not accept our command and will decide the timing and sea areas of their own attack..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "We in Carthage have worked hard for decades to transport gold and silver to them so that they can live comfortably under Persian rule, but what we got in return was this answer! They brought warships to the Western Mediterranean just to Are you just trying to show off! What use does such a motherland have to us!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Marco got angry, and Annobus stood aside quietly and listened.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Does Hanno know about this?” Mago suddenly asked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I have informed the Senate, and the Senate has asked Lord Hanno to send people to negotiate with the Tyrians..." Annobas answered carefully.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It seems that the Phoenician combined fleet cannot be counted on for the time being!" Mago's face did not show frustration. He had obviously obtained the information in advance and expected such a result, so he glanced at Anno Bass glanced at him and said, "I called you here to tell you that I have decided to lead my army to land in Sicily tomorrow!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Tomorrow?!” Annobas was really startled, and he looked at Mago with wide eyes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mago also looked at Annobas, with an unusually determined expression. Then he raised his head and pointed at the big flag flying in front: "Did you see it, Southwest Wind! I asked many people in Carthage and Utica Experienced old sailors, they are all unanimously sure that the same wind will blow and the same rain will fall tomorrow! The clippers I sent out to detect the enemy's situation and the merchant ships returning to the port told me that no Dionysius was found on the route today. If there are traces of the Asian warships, then there is a high chance that they will not show up tomorrow!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "But... if the weather is still like this tomorrow, the sea will be very windy and rough, which will cause great difficulties for landing! What's more, the weather at sea is unpredictable. If we encounter it again..." Annobas stopped talking. But the fear on his face made it clear what he was trying to say.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Storm." Mago softly spat out the word Annobas wanted to say, and then said resolutely: "Since you think so, the Dionians must also have such fear, so they If no warships were sent today, they will definitely be huddled in the port tomorrow. This is a good opportunity for us to land! Without the help of the Tyrians, our army can also be more powerful without the threat of the Dionian fleet. Easily landed in Sicily...and then surprised the Dionians and launched a sudden attack! If we really encounter another storm, it means that Bar Harmon no longer protects Carthage. No matter how much we do, Our efforts are in vain... But this is impossible, because we in Carthage have been blessed by Bar Hamon and Tanit and have survived here for hundreds of years, and we will continue to survive here!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "But -" Annobas still wanted to persuade, but Mago impatiently waved his hand to stop him: "I asked you to come, not to listen to your nagging, but to ask you to discuss and formulate a landing plan with me as soon as possible. , and then notify Carthage and Utica as soon as possible to make all preparations."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Okay, Master Mago, I am opposed to such a risk, but since you insist, I can only obey your orders." Annobas knew Mago and knew that no more persuasion would be of any use. He said in such a tone What he said was actually the plan of "if the login fails, this can be used as an excuse."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the second day, it really started to drizzle on the coast where Carthage was located, and a southwesterly wind blew, which also affected western Sicily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Generally, in such a climate, the workers at Lilibi Port will be relatively leisurely, because few merchant ships will go to sea for trade in such weather. However, due to the raging of the Dionian warships, only in such weather , the Carthaginian and Phoenician merchant ships would be safe. Yesterday, Lilibi Port was quite busy, and it seems that the situation will not be bad today, so the port managers rushed the workers to the dock early in the morning.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There are no Carthaginians among the laborers in Lilibi. After all, almost all Carthaginians are from wealthy families, and no one will engage in such backbreaking and menial work. More than half of them are Numibian slaves, but these people have lived in the interior since childhood. The Numibians are only suitable for some hard work and heavy work. Some more demanding port jobs such as how to guide ships to docks, secure ships, better load and unload cargo... need to be completed by other races with navigation experience. , so there are also some Greek slaves, mixed Phoenician and Greek free people, and even Greek free people among the laborers at Lilibi. This is because Phoenicians and Greeks have lived together on this small island for hundreds of years. the result of.
