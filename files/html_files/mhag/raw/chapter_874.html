   Chapter 874 Attacking Lola (2)
  </font>

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, Aialos also noticed that the attacks of the defenders at the top of the city were weakening. Obviously, the Lola warriors defending at the top of the city had never suffered such a siege method. Although in the long-range attacks from both sides, they relied on the battlements. Although they still had a slight advantage in terms of protection, the increase in the number of injured people also made them feel a lot of pressure.

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “The enemy is in some confusion!” He said with a joyful face to Xantiparis, who was also at the rear and observing the enemy's situation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “This is a good thing, it can reduce the casualties of soldiers and people, but the hardest battle has yet to come.” Zantiparis said calmly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Aiaros understood what Xantiparis said was the hardest battle—that is, the face-to-face fight after the mountains and city walls were closed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Compared to the bustle of the battlefield in the south city, it is much quieter outside the west city wall.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   First, hundreds of Campania light infantry carried arrow shields made by Dionysian carpenters and withstood the long-range attacks of the city defenders. They came to the trench, opened the brackets behind the arrow shields, and let It stood up diagonally to provide shelter for the light infantry. At the same time, they would occasionally launch javelins and arrows from the gaps between the arrow shields to attack the defenders at the top of the city.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While the defenders were restrained, the Dionian heavy infantry pushed out the siege wagons one after another. (The Dionian Army engineers instructed the carpenters of Enona and Campania to use soldiers from the mountain forest The felled wood was used to make this kind of hollow wooden cart), just like what the soldiers of the Second Legion did when Davos led his army to storm Rome, the wooden carts were spliced ​​together while pushing towards the city wall. Straight to the trench.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not only were the Allied soldiers surprised, but the defenders at the head of the city were also dumbfounded. There was no one in the wooden cart, and the rockets fired could not ignite it. The soldiers of Dionysia quickly passed around the carriages filled with soil. With sacks, the narrow ditch in front of him was quickly filled up.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then, the wooden carts continued to push forward one after another until they hit the city wall, thus forming two hollow passages from the city wall to forty meters away, formed by the siege carriages. The soldiers at the rear immediately carried a large A log with an iron cone-shaped ram inlaid on the front end of the wood. The battering ram was passed by the soldiers and reached the bottom of the city wall. Six soldiers carried it and hit the city wall hard.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The hard hammer head violently hit the old stone wall that was in disrepair. The stones shattered, the soil fell off, and the stone wall cracked...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The shaking of the city wall panicked the defenders at the top of the city. They increased the intensity of their attacks, violently smashed rocks and wood blocks down, poured thin oil on them, and launched rockets...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Unexpectedly, the vans closest to the city wall were specially made to be extremely strong. The craftsmen not only reinforced the entire frame, but also adopted a herringbone structure on the roof to facilitate load relief, and they were tied with bags soaked in water. The soil is not easily ignited, so soldiers can safely hit the city wall hard inside.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the siege ram broke through the outer stone wall and exposed the rammed earth layer inside, the soldiers picked up pickaxes and shovels and began to remove the stones around the gap, expand the hole in the wall, and then continuously dig out the rammed earth inside. Soil...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just the defense of the west and south walls has put a lot of pressure on the small Lola defenders, not to mention that the coalition forces also launched attacks on the east and north sides. In order to defend the city, the Lola people mobilized all the tribesmen in the city who could fight, including women, to go to the city to defend it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The most intense battlefield in Nancheng lasted for half an hour. The arms of the Dionysian light infantry were so sore that they could not lift them up. Their fingers were injured and bleeding from pulling the bow. The heavy infantrymen who formed the shield wall suffered 300 casualties. There were many people, and the casualties among the people were also not small.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But a turning point finally appeared, and the Lola defenders ran out of javelins. In just half an hour, they threw thousands of javelins. In addition to the javelins thrown a few days ago to prevent the Dionians from building earth mountains, all the javelins in the city have been used up, and the arrows have also been used up. Almost consumed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As for the javelin thrown by the Dionian light infantry, it has a specially made tip. The iron rod connecting the tip is very thin. After hitting a hard object, it will bend and cannot be thrown again. However, the front end of the javelin can be quickly disassembled. The iron spear tip can be used again by putting the new spear tip on the wooden pole at the rear end, but it is obviously impossible for the Lola defenders to do this.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, the defenders can only throw stones and wood at their opponents. Since Dionia's shield wall is ten meters away from the city head, stones that are too heavy cannot be thrown, and those that can be thrown are easier to be blocked by long shields. The threat of the Dionian heavy infantry is much smaller. If the shield wall can continue to stabilize, it will be faster for the people to drop earth bags.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing that the valley was gradually being filled, the earthbags had risen to the feet of the Dionian heavy infantry. They began to move forward carefully with their shields, so that the people who followed could fill in the depressions further ahead.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Aialos at the foot of the mountain was already gathering the 1,000 Campanian heavy infantry, preparing to replace the army on the top of the mountain.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The bugle sounded, and the Dionian light infantry quickly retreated down the mountain. According to Zantiparis' plan, Aialos led the Campanian heavy infantry into more than a dozen columns, widened the distance, and slowly marched towards the mountain to facilitate the evacuation of the people and the Dionian heavy infantry downwards. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Campania heavy infantry wore Corinthian helmets and held large copper bucklers. They had narrow vision and clumsy movements. Climbing the mountain was difficult for them. Fortunately, the slope of the hillside was gentle, which did not cause much damage to their march. Influence.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Dionian heavy infantry who formed a shield formation on the top of the mountain, without the assistance of light infantry, moved towards the city wall, and the attacks became more fierce. Some Lola warriors even climbed over the wall and over the battlements, jumping to the city wall. The almost filled earth mountain, armed with spears, directly attacked the Dionia heavy infantry.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   During this long-term battle to defend the city, the Lola defenders had clearly seen that these Dionian soldiers held shields with both hands and did not carry spears at all, so the Lola soldiers were one foot deep and one foot shallow. He stepped on the uneven earth bag with one foot, knocked away the long shield with his body, even knocked down the enemy, and then stabbed the spear in his hand.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The shield wall formed by two rows of Dionysian heavy infantry became fragmented. When the people fled downwards in panic, the Dionysian officers shouted: "No retreat! Throw away a long Shield, replace it with a dagger!!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, without them shouting, the soldiers were already doing this. These reserve soldiers from the Lucania Mountains had previously withstood the enemy's long-range attacks and watched hundreds of comrades casualties, but the enemy's sudden direct attack just now Causing dozens more casualties... They were all Lucanians who grew up after the establishment of the Kingdom of Dionia. Although the cultural integration of the kingdom weakened their wildness, military training taught them about teamwork and comrades-in-arms. With friendship and the anger of revenge for their comrades in arms, they held short swords and long shields and fought fiercely with the Lola defenders.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the bugle of Dionysia's retreat was sounded at this time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the soldiers were reluctant, they had to obey the order.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Lola soldiers did not continue to pursue them, because they saw those "tin cans" coming up, so they ran backwards and climbed into the city wall.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On this hill of more than 50 meters wide, the Campania heavy infantry slowly approached the defenders at the head of the city, gradually forming a dense formation. They were only one battlement away from the defenders, although the spears could easily stab them. The enemy, however, was unable to use the charge and impact that heavy infantry was good at, and its power was greatly weakened. The bugles of the attack below the city continued to sound, and the Campanian heavy infantry on the mountain, led by Aialos, began to fight fiercely with the enemy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   To be honest, in these years of war between the Campanians and the Samnites, there were few good opportunities for such face-to-face fighting, because the Samnites warriors always used javelin throws to kill and injure the Campanian soldiers, and then retreated and lured them away. They pursued, taking advantage of the opponent's slow movement during the retreat, and repeatedly attacked with javelins until the opponent's formation was completely chaotic, and then sent armored infantry to break in and completely defeat the opponent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This set of tactics has been tried and tested repeatedly. The successive failures have made the Campanian people so frightened that they even dare not go out of the city for field battles. Today, they finally have a chance to avenge their humiliation. The Campanian soldiers roared loudly and shouted one by one. The spear stabs the enemy powerfully.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As the defender of the city, of course, the Lola defenders could not adopt the guerrilla tactics that had been effective in the past, and could only face the enemy head-on. They had soldiers in armor block the battlements, followed by light infantry, which also formed a dense formation in the corridors above the city. formation to counter the Campanian heavy infantry. In order to be able to compete with the enemy, they also mobilized some of the defenders of the western city wall, because they believed that the fighting in the west was calmer, and even if the number of defenders was small, it would be enough to cope with it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But shortly after the defenders of the western city wall were transferred, bad news came: the western city wall collapsed in two places.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is all the credit of the Dionian soldiers in the siege van. They removed the stone walls and rammed earth at the lower end of the city wall, destroying the foundation of the wall, causing the already weak city wall to collapse due to gravity, and scattered The rocks even injured several Dionian soldiers who had no time to retreat.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The loud "rumbling" sound and the rising morning fog not only shocked the Lola defenders, but also dumbfounded the Campania soldiers. Originally, they saw the unique and slow behavior of the Dionysian soldiers. Teng Teng's siege method has not seen any movement for so long, and he can't help but feel a little contempt in his heart. He feels that it is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Some soldiers even said disdainfully: "They say that the Dionians are brave in battle. It seems that they are too. Those who are afraid of death only know how to hide in wooden boxes!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And now the tragic experience of the city wall gave them a resounding slap in the face. Of course they don't know: in the various military camps in the Kingdom of Dionia, not only will the soldiers actually build a section of the city wall during training to exercise their city-building abilities, but they will also practice how to break this section in the next training. The city wall, so the Dionian soldiers did not dig randomly, but destroyed the structure of the city wall purposefully and efficiently.
