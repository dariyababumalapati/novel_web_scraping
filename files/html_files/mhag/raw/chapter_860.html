   Chapter 860 The Great Victory of Aquilonia
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Those Samnite warriors who were at the end were naturally easily overtaken and stabbed by the Dionian light armored soldiers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing the Samnite army retreating across the board, the Dionian light infantry, which was originally the second line of attack, also took the initiative to break away from the protection of the heavy infantry, spread their legs, ran forward, and soon caught up with the light armored soldiers. At the same time, they also gradually expanded the pursuit net to the east.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pollet, who was leading his troops to the foot of the mountains to the west, heard the sound of the attack bugle coming from the east. He felt anxious and loudly issued an order: "Stop forming formations. Get up the mountain immediately and rush over. Surround the Samnites!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After giving the order, Pollet remembered Xantiparis beside him, and then asked apologetically: "General Xantiparis, what do you think?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The 60-year-old Zantiparis followed this non-stop mountain march. By now, his legs were so tired that he was weak. He was supported by two guards. He was panting next to him and forced a smile: "Mr. Polet." ...I completely agree with...your decision!...However, we have to hurry up...don't lose to them!" As he spoke, he pointed forward with his finger.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A few hundred meters away, there was a black and red troop climbing up the mountain.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Polet's expression immediately changed: "You're right, we can't lose to the Samnites!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He immediately ordered the buglers to continue to blow the attack bugle, and asked his subordinates to urge the soldiers to climb over the mountains quickly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Potentians are also a mountain race, and their ability to cross mountains and ridges is also not weak. The soldiers drew out the Dionian daggers they wore (this was after they received Dionian military training and received permission from the Ministry of Military Affairs, Purchased from the weapons merchant in Dionia), of course, it is not used to kill enemies at this moment, but to cut down various branches and stinging thorns that block the road on the way up the mountain.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While the soldiers were climbing up the mountain quickly, Pollet was also reminded by Zantiparis to let the troops behind extend northward, trying not to leave a large gap with the Abenirum army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the two troops worked hard to climb up as if they were in a competition, it took more than 20 minutes to climb halfway up the mountain. By this time, they could already hear shouts from the other side of the mountain. The sound of fighting became increasingly clear.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldiers immediately cheered up, knowing that the enemy was not far away from them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Polet also hurriedly asked the messenger to inform the soldiers to find a flat place as soon as possible or stop advancing and level the ground in place so that they could stand firm.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not only the Potentians are doing this, but the Abenirum people are also taking the same measures.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   All the soldiers stopped advancing halfway up the mountain. From a distance, it looked like a curved belt lining these continuous mountains.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ten minutes later, the shouts became clearer, mixed with continued exclamations and the sound of branches and leaves rubbing against each other... Although the sight was blocked by the lush woods, the Lucanian soldiers knew that the enemy had turned over. After crossing the ridge, they were rushing towards them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although these mountains look relatively gentle, the slope is actually not small. As the saying goes, "It is easier to go up the mountain than to go down the mountain." But for these mountain races, going down the mountain is much easier than going up the mountain. Before long, Potentia The soldiers saw the enemy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It stands to reason that when fighting in the mountains, the side with lower terrain is inherently at a disadvantage, but don't forget that the Samnite army was in retreat, so these defeated soldiers who were running at the front actually slipped down lying down. Perhaps they slipped because they were pushing each other during the flight, or perhaps they thought this method could help them run faster, but when they saw an enemy in front of them, their bodies were covered in bloodstains and buttocks scraped by weeds and branches, and their buttocks were almost shattered. The Samnite warriors did not even have the strength to stand up, and could only shout in horror: "There are enemies! There are enemies!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a result, he was either stabbed to death by Potentian soldiers or automatically became a prisoner.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then a large group of defeated soldiers appeared. The Samnite soldiers who ran in front adopted the method of running downright. In order to restrain the inertia and prevent falling, they had to hug the trees from time to time, so they often held the trees in their hands. The weapon could not be saved, either the shield was lost or the spear was thrown away.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And the last wave of defeated troops ran sideways down. Although the speed was slow, they were steady. They also became the main force in attacking Potentia's defense line.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the Abenirum side, when they saw their compatriots all over the mountains fleeing in panic from the top of the mountain, the soldiers had mixed emotions, and the same was true for Gairni. But he knew that since the war between Samoni and Dionia, they had lost consecutive battles. Coupled with today's failure, the final defeat of the entire Samoni tribe alliance was inevitable. Abenirum could only follow Dionia closely. Only then could they be reborn after this war, so Gairni only hesitated a little before giving the order to attack.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The heavy javelins thrown by the warriors knocked down the Samnite troops descending the mountain one by one.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Oh my God, it’s an Abenirumite!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “How dare you collude with outsiders and kill your own compatriots, Savoni will definitely punish you!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Abenirum people, we all belong to the Shirpini tribe. For the sake of our fellow tribesmen, please let us go!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Angry curses, curses, and pleadings came from the mouths of the defeated soldiers. The expressions of the Abenirum warriors did not change, and they did not stop waving their weapons. The Samnite tribal alliance has blocked, suppressed, and discriminated against Abenirum for more than ten years. Today it bore bad consequences, and the Abenirum people had a deep hatred for the other Samnites, and it was not something that could be dissolved with just a few words.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The defeated Samnite troops eventually fought with the Abenirum and Potentia people who intercepted them. In order to escape, they were inspired by the bloody courage and relied on the terrain to suppress the opponent's line and retreat continuously. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the Potentia-Abenirum front was not broken. After all, Pollet summoned 12,000 soldiers this time, and Guerni also brought 3,000 soldiers, with a total strength of twice that of the opponent. Half.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What's more, the defeated soldiers were disorganized, poorly equipped, and disorganized. After a fierce attack failed to work, some of the defeated soldiers retreated. After all, although they took advantage of their ability to climb mountains, they left the Dionian pursuers behind. Behind them, but now they are intercepted here by another group of enemies. Once the Dionia pursuers arrive and attack from the front and back, they will have no way to escape, so some defeated soldiers gave up breaking through from the front and turned to the north and south. Escape sideways, trying to bypass the enemy's interception.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not long after, the collective retreat of the Samnite coalition completely turned into a rout...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The three armies of Dionia, Potentia, and Abenirum launched a pursuit at the same time...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the end, the Samnite coalition suffered more than 1,500 casualties, more than 3,000 were captured, and more than 1,000 fled, while the Dionian coalition suffered less than 400 casualties.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the atmosphere of joy of victory, Zantiparis, Pollet, and Garni met Alexis who was still in the valley.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Zantiparis, it's not too late for you to come." Alexis tactfully expressed his dissatisfaction. You must know that after a long wait, he not only had doubts about whether the reinforcements could arrive, I even feared whether I could successfully bring the troops back to the camp. Looking back now, I am still a little scared.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "On the way here, we encountered some problems. We did arrive a little late, but it did not affect our final victory -" Zantiparis laughed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Gairni took the initiative to take over the conversation and said apologetically: "The reason why we are late is mainly because of me..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It turned out that after Abenirum fell to Dionia, the Ministry of Military Affairs originally approved Alexis's attack plan and pulled out the nail against the waists of Pucetti and Daoni - Aquiloni Asia, let Abernirum, Copsa, and Aquilonia be connected together, so that the entire southern area of ​​​​Shirpini can be owned by Dionia, which also reduces the pressure on the northern border of the kingdom. Defensive pressure.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, during the communication with Gairni, the details about the Samnite tribal alliance that Gairni revealed attracted the attention of the Ministry of Military Affairs. According to the information provided by Gairni and the Samnite coalition forces in the first three battles, (including the previous battle with Cavutini), the staff made detailed calculations and speculated that the number of existing Samnite coalition forces may be more than the more than 10,000 Samnite coalition soldiers who are besieging Naples. Then Where would those thousands of extra Samnite warriors be? Are the Samnites hiding some conspiracy? ...Military Minister Hilos had to think seriously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, after communicating with Alexis through letters, a new attack plan was formed: Alexis still led the eastern troops into the mountains to attack Aquilonia. If the Samnites were indeed unable to reinforce, Then capture Aquilonia directly; if the Samnites really hid thousands of warriors and prepared to lure the Dionysian army to fight in the mountains, then Dionysia also prepared a backup plan.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This back-up team is Alnirum and Potentia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Polet, the leader of Potentia, responded positively to the joint attack on the Samnite Mountains. He had already summoned 12,000 soldiers. As for Garni, if it were in the past, he might still hesitate, but the news that the leader of Naconia, Quinduk, was trapped and killed, and that the entire Naconia region was occupied by the Samnite coalition forces, has spread to Azerbaijan. The territory of Benirum, because to the north of Abenirum is Beneventum ruled by Lesguk, to the west it is partially adjacent to the Naconian territory, and to the south it is bordered by the territory of Dionysia (especially (closely adjacent to Copsa), so the Samoni Tribe Alliance's bloody approach to breaking the tradition made him highly vigilant and fearful, and also made him determined to follow Dionia against the Samoni Tribe Alliance.
