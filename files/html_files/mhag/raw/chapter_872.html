 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, Kontruk did not intend to lead the team to leave. He decided to follow the ancient tradition of the Samnite tribe alliance and defend Beneventum with the Shirpini tribe, advancing and retreating together.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the mountains in early summer, the soil is still moist, the trees are already lush, the weeds are growing wildly, and the summer cicadas have already started chirping incessantly. The hot sunlight passes through the dense branches and leaves, casting wisps of mottled light on the mountain grass.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Three Abenirum spies were lying on the ground, swatting away the biting mosquitoes on their bodies while closely looking down at the winding mountain road down the mountain.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Brother, look!” A spy pointed forward and shouted in surprise.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I saw many birds flying between the mountains to the east, chirping and circling in the air.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Let’s go and take a look!” The spy named Big Brother also showed joy on his face. He stood up, stretched his aching thighs, and then led the two of them and ran eastward along the ridge.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not long after, they lay down on the mountain ridge again and looked down: the mountain road more than a hundred meters apart was crowded with densely packed Samnite warriors. They lined up in a long queue, stretching eastward...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the uniforms of the warriors from the four major tribes are roughly the same, and they are too far apart to see the flags clearly, the experienced Abenirum spies were still able to tell that this was Cavutini's army, because under the sunlight This long dragon has a lot of reflections, which shows that the rate of armor in the team is not low, and among the four major tribes, only the Cavutini can do it, because they own the eastern plains of Campania and are the richest tribe. What's more, the direction this army is heading towards is Kautim.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Chief Garni is right. The Kautini people have indeed evacuated from Beneventum. We have not waited for this day in vain!" The leading spy could not hide the joy on his face.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “But we haven’t discovered where the Narconians are yet?”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Of course it's not clear from this mountain, but I can roughly guess their location." The leading spy said confidently: "We haven't seen Naconia since their army entered the city of Beneventom. People went out to fight in the city, and they were not even sent to patrol the city. This shows that the Kawutini people were prepared for them. I think they must be walking in the middle of the team... There are 3,000 people there, and they can be found easily. Watching them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You rush back immediately and tell Chief Gairni that I, Seduni, have begun to implement the plan... And you, rush to the Dionia camp in Lola and tell their commander that we have been contacted The Naconian army..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Brother, you have to be careful!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Don’t worry, it’s easy for me to sneak in alone.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What Seduni said was not a word of comfort, because the Samoni army did not always walk on the mountain road like the Dionian army when marching in the mountains. When the mountains on both sides slowed down, the Samoni army would Separating some soldiers to march on the mountainside on both sides, this not only shortened the length of the marching column, but also reduced the possibility of being ambushed, but it made it easy for Seduni to sneak into the army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After sending away the two spies, he dusted himself off, carried a few javelins, and sneaked down the mountain under the cover of trees, and then hid in the weeds.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a short period of carefully listening to the conversation of the soldiers marching at a close distance, he stood up decisively, pretended to have just finished urinating, and approached the team walking on the hillside. Since he was wearing the same yellow short-sleeved singlet, plus The marching column of Kautini was not as rigorous as the Dionians, but rather scattered, so he easily blended into the team.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then, through silent conversations with several Naconian warriors around him, he decided to go to the leader of the Afangum, the second largest tribe in Naconia (the reason why he did not go to Quinduque's tribe , because this tribe has been completely separated by Segovani, and its people have also been forcibly merged into the tribes of Lola and Sesala).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You said you are from Abenirum?" Wasonk looked at the man with a straight face, warily looking at the man who tried to approach him quietly but was stopped by the guards, but there was a hint of excitement in his tone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seduni also noticed his youth. Judging from his appearance, he should be just over 20 years old. According to Samnite tradition, it is impossible to lead an army of tribes in battle, but Segovani imprisoned various tribes in Naconia. The leaders of the tribe let their young children lead the tribe's warriors for better control.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “In order to prevent being seen by some people, we’d better talk while walking.” Seidum suggested in a low voice.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Vasonk looked around subconsciously, then nodded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seduni pretended to be Vasonk's guard, and followed Vasonk forward with other warriors.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Wasonk couldn't wait to whisper and asked: "What's going on in Nakonia?! We heard rumors in the city of Beneventum that the Dionians hated us for killing Hadi in their territory!" After the Si priests and Dionian merchants invaded the Naconian territory, they not only killed the wolves of Segovani, but also...also...killed all of our...our tribesmen...but The familiar Kautini warriors quietly told us that your tribe often shouted outside Beneventum, saying that the Dionians had formed an alliance with the tribesmen we stayed in the territory... and some others. Which rumor is true?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seduni did not speak immediately, but took out something from his arms and quietly handed it to Vasonk.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Vasonk’s eyes widened immediately. He recognized this as a small wooden sculpture that he liked the most when he was a child.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seduni looked at his expression and felt confident: "This is the token that your tribal elder asked me to bring to you. I also have tokens that I brought to several other tribal leaders. The real situation is that Dioni The Asian army drove away the Cavutim people stationed in the city of Naconia, and formed an alliance with the tribal elders of Naconia to jointly fight against the Samnite coalition..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Seduni finished speaking, Wasonk had not yet responded. The guards next to him were already looking excited. The Cavutim people trapped and killed Quinduk, imprisoned the tribal leaders, massacred the tribesmen in the territory, and forced them to go out to fight. , and regardless of their life or death, always let them rush to the front... There was a fire burning in the hearts of these Naconian warriors, but due to the strength of the Samnite coalition and the safety of the territorial tribesmen, they had to endure the humiliation and bear the heavy burden. , now the opportunity has come!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Some people even shouted in a low voice: "Great!" Their eyes burst out with the flames of revenge, staring directly at Vasonk.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Vasonk squeezed the small wooden sculpture in his hand tightly and whispered: "When we get to Kautim, I will quietly send someone to tell the other Naconian generals..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the day that Segovani led the army to retreat from Beneventum, Zantiparis, who was in the military camp outside the city of Lola, had decided to launch an attack on the city of Lola.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Four days have passed since the siege of the city. Why is he so eager to attack the city? On the one hand, it was because he was worried about the return of the Samnite coalition forces, which caused all previous efforts to be in vain; on the other hand, his siege layout was almost completed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When he first arrived at Lola City, Zantiparis carefully observed this plain town in Kautini: Although it is nearly seven meters high and is a stone city, the walls are dilapidated and the gaps in the stone walls are large. Grass has even grown in the place, and the trench outside the city is not too wide. Although there is a simple deer camp outside the trench, no traps are laid out...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Based on this, Zantiparis estimated that this Kautini town had never been attacked, so it had not been well maintained and repaired, which gave him the confidence to break the city in a short period of time (in fact, Kautini last year The Utini invaded Campania and were defeated by the Dionian reinforcements, and the Third Army entered Tessala, which has already made the Kautini towns such as Lola and Sessala, which are closer to Tessala, feel the threat. Due to the danger, they put "strengthening the city's defense" on the agenda, but not long after the all-out war between the Samnites and Dionia broke out, Lola's young and middle-aged people were transferred, and the repair of the city wall was delayed).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Zantiparis considered that there were few defenders in the city of Lola, and except for enemy reinforcements that might come from the north, other areas were controlled by Dionia and its allies, so he and Aialos, the leader of the Campania army, After discussing with others, they decided to build a mountain of earth to approach the city wall.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Building an earth mountain to siege the city is a project of the Dionysian Army's daily military training. Zantiparis and the soldiers are familiar with it. After deciding to build the earth mountain to the south of Lola City and engineers surveying it, the starting point of the construction will be Set 40 meters away from Nancheng.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So Xantiparis ordered most of the soldiers to go to the mountains and cut down trees.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, after Adriancus, the administrator of Enona, received help from Zantiparis, he not only organized thousands of people from Enona, but also sent some administrative officials, who carried three days of rations and passed through The original trade route passed through the Naconian territory and reached outside the city of Lola. After the Naconians learned the news, they also sent thousands of people. Subsequently, the Campania Alliance also sent tens of thousands of people. In less than two days, more than 30,000 people (including 12,000 coalition soldiers) gathered in the Dionia coalition camp.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Zantiparis made this plan for building Tushan: He first left 2,000 Campania heavy infantry to garrison the camp to prevent the enemy from sneaking out of the city to attack. The other soldiers went to the mountains and forests to cut trees, and some of the cut wood was made into five pieces. , six-meter-high wooden fences, and then two hundred soldiers erected rows of wooden fences 30 meters away from the south wall of Lola, with a length of 70 meters, to resist javelins and arrows fired by enemies from the top of the city. At the same time, there are 300 Dionian heavy infantry on both sides and rear of Muzha on standby to prevent the enemy from leaving the city and destroying it.
