   As soon as Alexis led the army into the mountains, he was discovered by Aquilonian spies. The Aquilonians immediately sent their best warriors who were good at long-distance running in the mountains to the northwest, which was more than 100 miles away. Kautim in .

   Hidden in the territory of Kautini is the remaining military force of the Samonei Tribal Alliance - 7,000 warriors. Its general is none other than Usibik, the leader of the large tribe of Kautini. Yesterday afternoon, he learned that After this news, I was overjoyed, thinking that this was my chance to take revenge.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Moreover, the Aquilonian messenger anxiously urged again and again, because there were only more than 200 warriors in Aquilonia, and even with the dangerous terrain, they might not be able to resist for long, so Usibik quickly summoned these 7,000 soldiers. A warrior rushed to rescue Aquilolia.
  </font>

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was not until noon today that they arrived near the Aquilonian territory.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The warriors led by Usibik came from each of the four major tribes. They were each led by their own leaders. During the march, the marching formation gradually became scattered, with more than three miles between the head and the tail. By the time the middle part of Usibik's team climbed up the mountain, its front warriors had already rushed down the valley and directly attacked the Dionian army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing this situation, Usibik knew that he could not stop it, so he simply let it attack. While ordering the team in the middle to slow down, waiting for the soldiers from the rear to arrive, he paid attention to the battle situation ahead.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The main attack on the Dionian army was more than 1,000 Hilpini warriors, most of whom were javeliners. The Shirpini tribe suffered the heaviest losses in this war. These warriors hated the Dionysians, but were also somewhat afraid of them, so after rushing down the hillside, they not only slowed down their advance, And completely dispersed the team, taking advantage of the ups and downs of the hills and the cover of the trees, like a hunting lynx, slowly approaching the Dionian army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, the Dionian army occupied a higher place in the valley. 1,500 heavy infantry spread out in a semi-circle, all squatting down and forming a shield formation; behind them were two light infantry The 1,000 archers in the brigade bent their bows and set arrows, watching the approaching enemy; behind the archers, there were 1,000 harpooneers; 1,000 light armored soldiers joined the heavy infantry array to form the eastern defense line. Being wary of enemies who might come down from Aquilonia also made the entire military formation form an oval; the remaining 1,000 light armored soldiers were scattered in the open space in the middle of this oval formation.

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alexis stood on a rock and could see the approaching enemy through the soldiers arrayed in front. The sight in front of him made him frown slightly, because at this time most of the Samnite warriors had already entered the range of the archers, but they were scattered in twos and threes in a one-mile radius 50 meters away from the front of the military formation. Relying on the cover of mounds, rocks, and trees, the Dionian archers did not dare to fire volleys easily, because the killing effect would only be very low.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Notify the two light infantry captains and advise them to let the soldiers attack on their own, but be careful to save arrows and javelins... because today's battle may last for a long time." Alexis issued in an uncertain tone Ordered.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the two light infantry captains passed on the order, the archers who had gained autonomy became more focused. They also picked up the bows and arrows hanging under their bodies and pointed them at the area directly in front of them, but they hid. The enemy made them unsure of hitting, so they kept holding back their arrows.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Samnite warriors did not continue to approach, because the Dionysian soldiers cleared the area 30 to 40 meters in front of the formation, cut down the overly tall grass and cut down the miscellaneous trees. Due to limited time, some were still retained. There are big trees and large rocks, but the entire field of view has been much wider. In addition, the Dionians are condescending, and further advancement may increase the risk of being shot.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two sides suddenly fell into a state of stillness, and the atmosphere became increasingly tense.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Captain, why don’t they attack yet?” A heavy infantryman turned around and asked in a low voice Rakelesis behind him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Calm down!" Rachaelesis reminded in a low voice: "Concentrate! Hide your body and hold on to your shield tightly!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The attacks in the previous two nights made Alexis and the team officers aware of the power of the Samnite heavy javelin. After discussion, everyone decided: When defending in a shield formation, the soldiers can insert the lower end of the long shield on the ground and push forward with both hands. Tighten the arm straps on the inside of the long shield, squat sideways, and try not to contact the shield with your body. This is to reduce the damage caused to the soldiers after the heavy javelin penetrates the long shield.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I know, I know, captain, you have said it many times before." The soldier replied impatiently.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Attention! The enemy is coming!” Rachaelesis said seriously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldier hurriedly turned around, poked his head out from above the long shield, and looked out: he saw those small red dots dotted in a green field gradually starting to move in the direction of the military formation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Every time the Dionian Legion soldiers participate in military camp training, almost every first event is to stand in formation on the playground and remain silent for at least half an hour. The Samonite warriors obviously did not have any special training in this area. The two sides competed statically for only ten minutes. Some warriors could not bear the pressure. Some warriors left the shelter and began to move forward (because the range of the heavy javelin was Within 30 meters), it naturally attracted other soldiers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Immediately afterwards, the Dionysian archers began to shoot at the targets they aimed at.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Samoni warrior held a small round wooden shield in his left hand to block his head, and held a javelin in his right hand. His bare feet stepped on the uneven grass ground, but he could quickly run out of the zigzag route. , want to get close to the enemy quickly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the continuous firing of arrows by the Dionysian archers caused a great obstacle to the advancement of the Samnite warriors. Their wooden shields were too small and they had almost no protection. When avoiding the arrows, they only needed a moment to If you stop, there may be several arrows shot from several directions at the same time, making it impossible to avoid.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In a short period of time, many Samnite warriors fell in the area between 50 meters and 30 meters. When they were about to advance to 30 meters, what greeted them was no longer arrows, but javelins. The thin wooden shield was unable to withstand the astonishingly powerful javelin and was directly shattered.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Some Samnite warriors luckily escaped the arrows and javelins, and then hurriedly threw the javelins in their hands. Most of them were blocked by the shield array, and a few flew into the array, causing a few screams, but compared to the Samnite warriors, The Monet's own casualties were too slight.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, the morale of the Samnites was greatly hit, and the momentum of their attack quickly weakened. At this moment, the horn of the Samnites retreating sounded, and the Samnites warriors whose fighting spirit had been weakened by the groans of their injured companions Quickly retreated 50 meters away from the Dionia army formation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But they did not stay away, but looked fiercely at the Dionian soldiers in front, seeming to be ready to attack again at any time. This made the Dionian team officers dare not give orders to let the soldiers pick up arrows and arrows. javelin.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Usibik came with the troops behind him and joined the leading troops. Since the attack just now caused losses to the Samnites, the leaders of the unified army took the initiative to surround Usibik.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The location where the Dionians are located is too open. We can't attack directly like this, otherwise the losses will be huge!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "No attack? What to do with my dozen or so injured people?! They are still lying in front of the Dionian formation, waiting for our rescue!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “I think we might as well go around to the back of the enemy’s formation and attack from there.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "That won't work! Their light infantry can also move to that side to stop our attack."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The leaders were arguing in a flurry, and Usibik did not stop him. He watched them quietly until everyone was red-faced and unable to come up with a unified opinion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   An old leader of Shirpini finally couldn't help but asked eagerly: "Usibik, you are the commander of the entire team appointed by the big leaders. Can you give me an idea, what should we do?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   His words caused the leaders to temporarily stop arguing and focus on Usibik.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Usibik then said sternly: "Dear leaders, the Dionians have occupied a favorable terrain, lined up their positions, and are waiting for us to attack. Even if we finally defeat the Dionians with a brave attack, military formation, but the casualties suffered by our people will definitely not be small! The war with the Dionians has been going on so far, and each tribe and tribe has suffered a lot of casualties. We can no longer arbitrarily Let our brave warriors suffer casualties!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Usibik is right!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “That’s right, there’s no one who won’t die in battle! Are we bringing our tribe here to see off the Dionians?”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing that the leaders were about to quarrel again, Usibik immediately said loudly: "Of course we have to send the Dionians away! Because as long as the Dionians start to retreat, they must leave the current favorable terrain and cannot Keep the current formation, and we can continue to attack them on their way back, on both sides of the mountain road, and on the mountain ridges, until we finally defeat them! This is the fighting method we are familiar with! Dionia We have finally deceived people into the mountains and are fighting in our familiar homeland. We must not let them go!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "But what if the Dionians don't retreat?" As soon as a leader spoke, he was ridiculed by other leaders: "If they don't retreat, where will they rest at night? With us watching here, they won't be able to do anything at all. Don’t dare build a camp here.”
