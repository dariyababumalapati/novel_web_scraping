   Chapter 861 Marching West
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Taking advantage of the Naconia incident, Guerni claimed to prevent the invasion of the Samnite coalition forces, summoned the people in the territory, and instituted military martial law. However, on the agreed day, only 1,000 soldiers were left to garrison the territory. With 3,000 warriors, he quietly entered the Dionysian territory to the south, but did not enter the city of Copsa, because there were probably spies from the Samnite coalition to the north of the city of Copsa, so Abenirum's army He hid in the Potentia territory south of Copsa City, joined his troops, and sent some men back to the Samonei Mountains to investigate the enemy's situation.

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Kopsa is located at the uppermost reaches of the Ofanto River and to the south of Lake Konsa. The terrain of the upper reaches of the Ofanto River is somewhat special. In addition to the relatively flat terrain around Kopsa and Lake Konsa, mountains stand towering on the north bank to the east. It is difficult to climb, and the terrain on the south coast is relatively gentle. This is why the Samnite coalition forces gathered in the Copsa area during the South Italian War and invaded Potentia.

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Alexis led his army into the mountains and camped in the River Bend, he sent a messenger, walked west along the south bank of the Ofanto River, and finally entered the territory of Potentia, notifying the person responsible for coordinating and commanding Potentia. Xantiparis of the coalition of Asia and Abenirum.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Zantiparis, Pollet, and Garni, who had been carefully observing the enemy's movements, received reports from spies early the next morning: six or seven thousand Samnite warriors appeared in the mountains to the north and were marching southeast .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   They immediately led the 15,000 soldiers northward into the upper reaches of the Ofanto River and advanced eastwards along the south bank.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Copsa is more than 30 miles away from the Reach. More than four hours later, the army arrived at the west of the Reach. The terrain on the north bank here has become relatively gentle. Just as Zantiparis was about to order the army to cross the Ofanto River, As they entered the North Shore area, Gairny made a suggestion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since he was familiar with the terrain of Aquilonia, he believed that the Dionian army would lure the Samnite coalition into the valley, but their armies rushed to Aquilonia from the south together. The movement was too great and would This caused the Samnite coalition forces to escape earlier from the northwest direction of the valley, which was easier to climb, so he suggested that the Abenirum army go north first and quietly make a large circle to the northwest of Aquilonia. Launch an attack and encircle the Samnite coalition forces together with the Potentian army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Polet expressed his objection to this, but he did not explain the reason and just winked quietly at Zantiparis. In fact, he was worried about the Abenirum people acting alone, fearing that they would inform the news.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, Zantiparis agreed to Galni's suggestion after careful consideration. After all, it would be easy for such a large army to defeat the Samnite coalition, but the Ministry of Military Affairs hoped that if the Samnite really If there are troops left in the mountains, it is best to make full use of this large Potentia-Abenirum coalition before they know it, so as to keep the Samonite force in the mountains as much as possible. Encirclement and annihilation are conducive to the next attack of the Dionia army. Although Zantiparis didn't know much about Gharni, Gharni's suggestion was most in line with the requirements of the Ministry of Military Affairs, so he decided to take the risk.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Half an hour after the Abenirum army left, the Potentian troops began to cross the river...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For these reasons, the army arrived nearly an hour late.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing the explanations of the three people, Alexis' face became slightly brighter. After all, the final result did prove that the actions they took were right, so he looked at the sky intentionally, and then said directly: "We will be there soon. It's dusk, we should immediately lead the army back to the military camp in the south to let the soldiers who have been fighting for a day have a good rest."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The three of them all agreed with his opinion. After all, the main force of the Samnites in the mountains has been completely destroyed, but harassment by small groups of enemies and even sneak attacks by wild beasts may still exist. It will be safer for several troops to camp together. , but for such a large army to arrive in the Reach, it is impossible to squeeze it all into the existing military camp. A new camp must be simply built next to it, so time must be seized.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Zantiparis looked at the mountains to the east and asked: "What are the plans for tomorrow? Capture Aquilonia first? It seems that this city is not easy to attack."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The corner of Alexis' lips curled up slightly. Although his voice was not loud, his tone was still full of confidence: "In my opinion, with today's victory, even if we don't occupy Aquilonia, it won't have any big impact on the entire war situation." Influence. My opinion is that tomorrow all troops march directly to Beneventum!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After today's observation of Aquilonia, it has been silent, especially when the Samnite coalition forces arrived and surrounded the Dionian army. The Aquilonian army did not come down the mountain and took the opportunity to attack Dionia. Onia launched a flanking attack, and Alexis judged that there were not many defenders in Aquilonia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I agree with General Alexis' plan!" Polet, who knew something about the Samnites, expressed his support loudly: "We must use this victory to expand our advantages and not give the Samnites a break. Chance, as long as we capture Beneventum, the Shirpinians will be finished! And through Beneventum, we can also directly threaten the central town of the Cavutini - Cavutim!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course Zantiparis also expressed his agreement, only Guerni fell into thinking.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Is Chief Garni regretting that he should not break away from the Samnite Tribal Alliance?!” Pollet said sarcastically upon seeing this.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Garni came back to his senses and hurriedly explained: "I was wondering if I could persuade Aquilonia to surrender, because among the previously captured Shirpinian warriors, there were many tribesmen from Aquilonia (because It is close to Dauni and Pucetti, and naturally contributed the most in the previous attack on Dauni), and now they have once again witnessed the defeat of the Samnite coalition... I know the leader of Aquilonia, he is a The old guy who doesn't care about friendship and only values ​​strength——"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Having said this, Garni gritted his teeth: Before the South-Italian War, the leader of Aquilonia was his father's most loyal supporter. After the South-Italian War, he immediately turned to Lescuq, and was targeting Abe. Full support for Nirum on the issue.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Under the current circumstances, it is very likely that the Aquilonians will choose to surrender.” Gairni finally said.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Being able to persuade Aquilonia to surrender would save a lot of trouble. Of course Alexis would not object. He immediately made a promise: "If Aquilonia is willing to surrender, Dionia can allow it to become a kingdom." Free City.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is not because Alexis is arrogant, but when the Ministry of Military Affairs briefly informed the five rotating presidents of the attack plan, everyone seriously considered "under the force of force, in case a Samnite town asks to surrender." The problem is that in view of the poor environmental conditions and very limited output of most towns in the Samnite Mountains, directly merging them into the kingdom will consume administrative resources. It is better to let them take care of themselves. For example, Aquilonia is located at such a high altitude. On the mountains, transportation is very inconvenient, and they can only rely on grazing to make a living. The vast majority of Dionysian elders and officials will probably refuse to come here to serve as chief executive or hold public office.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I will send people up the mountain now to persuade them to surrender. When we reach the Reach, there will be results." After Gairni finished speaking, he was ready to make arrangements.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Wait a minute!" Pollet stopped him and said, "I suggest it's better to take him with you, so as to convince the Aquilonians!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He waved his hand, and his men carried a body over.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Gairni took a closer look and couldn't help but take a breath. He knew the deceased. Usibik, the leader of the large tribe of Cavutim, had a high reputation among the Cavutini tribe and was once a member of the Cavutini tribe. A strong candidate for the Grand Chief, but he voluntarily gave up the competition with Segovani.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I heard from the prisoners that he was the commander-in-chief of the Samnite coalition. When they broke through, he rushed to the front and was stabbed to death by my warriors! I want to send the envoy out to take him with him, and let Ah The Quelonians understand their current situation better!" Pollet said loudly, not only promoting his achievements, but also secretly warning Gairni.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While Gurney was silent, Alexis said, "I think this is a good idea."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Gairni immediately wiped away a trace of sadness in his heart and said simply: "I will ask my men to carry him up the mountain right away!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the evening, the Dionian coalition soldiers were still resting in the river bend. The envoy sent by Gairni brought back more than a dozen hostages sent by Aquilonia, including one of the leader's sons, Aquilonia. Lonia fell.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alexis was overjoyed, and immediately comforted the people of Aquilonia with good words, and promised: after they go to Thurii, Dionia will soon release the previously captured Aquilonian warriors .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the surrender of Aquilonia made the entire southern territory of Shirpini a safe area, Alexis did not relax his vigilance and still ordered the sentries in the camp to strengthen patrols.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The night was uneventful.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The next day, 20,000 people from the Dionysian coalition broke out of camp and marched westward along the south bank of the Ofanto River, first arriving at Kopsa.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Here, Alexis detached 2,000 soldiers to escort the prisoners and escort the hostages in Aquilonia back to Thurii. He also discussed the supply and transportation of military rations with Copsa Administrator Xima.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Zantiparis also left the coalition at this moment and continued to rush west to Enona, where he once again led half of the reserve legion stationed there, preparing to show off his talents in the next battle.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the afternoon, the Dionian coalition left Copsa, bypassed Lake Kangsa, marched northwest, and entered the territory of Abenirum at dusk.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, outside the city of Naples, in the Samnite coalition camp, the leaders of the four major tribes were sitting in the big tent, all with solemn expressions, because they had just received the news that "the troops staying in the mountains suffered a disastrous defeat." news.
