   Chapter 882 Plan to deal with the Samnites
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax was not surprised. He followed Davos during this period. Davos would ask him questions from time to time when dealing with government affairs. He was used to it, and it also forced him to always pay attention to the battle reports and information coming from him. Information to think about.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, he walked to the table and stared at the map of Samnai and Campania, lost in thought.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   By this time, everyone else in the tent had remained quiet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tormid looked at Clotokatax who was thinking at the table and couldn't help but sigh.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   During his stay in Latium, since he often had to help Davos handle military affairs, he stayed with Davos most of the time. He had been in contact with Clotokatax for a long time. He witnessed this Dio with his own eyes. The prince of Nia went from being passionate and naive at first to being steady and thoughtful. From the beginning, officials, generals and soldiers looked at him with suspicion, and then gradually recognized him. This was due to the teachings of Davos. Fang is also inseparable from his own talents and efforts.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Judging from various signs, if nothing unexpected happens, Crotocathax is likely to be the next king of Dionia! Tormid was thinking in his mind: From now on, he should try his best to create conditions for his children to have more contact with Crotoka Tax! At the beginning, I lacked courage and did not follow Davos to Magna Graecia from the beginning. In addition, my talents were limited, so my current status was almost over, but the next generation...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just as Tormid was thinking about it, Crotokatax had already straightened out his thoughts and said to Davos: "Father, if we have completely defeated the Samnite tribe alliance, my opinion is... …These Cavutini towns in the eastern plains of Campania, except for Naconia, should be incorporated into Dionia, which will not only expand our territory and protect our alliance ( Referring to the Campania League), it can also deter the races in the mountains nearby.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But for these Samnite towns in the mountains, it is better to leave them to the Samnite people themselves. On the one hand, the Samoni people are unruly, and the tribes there rarely have contact with our Dionia. The cultural customs are completely different. It is very difficult to send officials to govern, and it is easy to cause conflicts, which wastes the energy and energy of the kingdom. Financial resources; on the other hand, the land in the mountainous area is barren, the environment is harsh, and the products are not abundant. I am afraid that not many Dionian citizens are willing to move to the Samonite mountainous area, so it is difficult for us to assimilate the Samonite race in the mountain in a short period of time. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Also...the two Samnite tribes, Pentney and Karacheni, are adjacent to other races in the mountains to the north. If we forcibly annex the lands of these two tribes, I am afraid it will arouse the vigilance and hatred of other races, causing unforeseen consequences. s consequence.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So I think... we can dissolve the Samonite Tribe Alliance and allow the four Samonite tribes to become affiliated allies of the kingdom, but we must also retain the positions of the chief leaders of the major tribes, so as to avoid their strength being weakened. It can also defend against their former enemies in the north and reduce our troubles..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax was talking eloquently, but before Davos responded, Tormid praised: "Your Majesty, Prince Clotto is very thoughtful, and I think his suggestions are very reasonable!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hnipolis looked at Thormid, blinked and said nothing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos showed a gratified smile and said affirmatively: "Kloteau, your proposal is very inspiring to me. The Samoni Tribal Alliance should indeed be disbanded. The complete annexation of the Samoni Mountains may not be possible from now on." It is not the time yet, so it seems necessary to retain the original political structures of several tribes and allow the existence of big leaders to facilitate the kingdom's control over them..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crotokatax was excited by Davos's agreement with his suggestion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "But -" Davos changed the subject, looked at him, and said seriously: "You were not careful enough when considering the problem, and your handling of the Samoni people was relatively rough. The situations of the four major tribes are different, and you are not careful enough. The way they are disposed of should also be different.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Silpini, as the largest tribe in Samonai, is also the tribe with the most borders on the kingdom’s territory. Although its territories are all in the mountains, we cannot be too indulgent. Beneventum must be incorporated into the kingdom. This is a rare and fertile lowland in the Samnite Mountains, and it is not small in area. I think the prospective citizens and free people of the kingdom are willing to settle there. And its location is also very important, right in the center of the territories of Shirpini and Cavutini, next to Abenirum and Cavutim. With it, we have a stable mountainous area of ​​​​Samnai. Cornerstone of the South.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, Abenirum has always been friendly to the kingdom, contributed a lot in this war, and has become a free city of the kingdom. We should reward it and allow Gairni to serve as the general of Sirpini. The leader, who rules over other Shirpini tribes and territories except Bereventum, makes it the second Potentia of the kingdom, giving it the strength to compete with the Penteni and Karacheni in the northern part of the mountainous area. , ensuring the security of the northern part of the kingdom.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Chautini, this tribe is quite special. Its territory is either the eastern plains of Campania or the lowlands in the valleys, which are actually very suitable for the people of the kingdom to settle. You just said it right. The towns of Cavutini on the eastern plains of Campania should be merged into Dionia, but this appetite is not big enough. Now that Beneventum is ready to be included in the kingdom's territory, Then Cavutim to the west of it and its surrounding subsidiary towns should also be included in our annexation plan, because only in this way can the connection between Beneventum and the eastern plains of Campania be guaranteed. So that it will not be left alone outside the kingdom's territory.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Don’t forget about Naconia. The people in this territory have been in contact with the kingdom for more than ten years, and they finally joined our side. Logically, we should guarantee their territory. But Naconia's position is more important. Previously, the Samnites attacked the Campanian League and captured Pompeii, Herculaneum and other city-states. Now Zantiparis has recovered Pompeii and Herculane. Nimes, so far, the Campania League has not asked us to return these two small cities. It is said that the Campania League suffered heavy casualties in this war and did not have enough manpower to cultivate these lands. My opinion I sent envoys to negotiate with the Campania Alliance to incorporate these two small cities into Dionia——"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hernepolis's eyes lit up and he interjected: "In this way, Bereventum, Cavutim, the original Cavutini town in the eastern plain of Campania, Pompeii, Herculane Nim can be connected to the Kingdom's Enona City, but...Naconia has become an obstacle..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos said confidently: "We can negotiate with the Naconians and let them move to the north of Capua, where there is the Volturno River and the land is more fertile. We can allow them to own more than they currently have." more territory in Naconia, and at the same time allowed them to elect the great chief of Kautini to rule over the northernmost areas of the original Kautini territory adjacent to Sidi Sini, Olonchi, and Penteni. The Kautini tribe, I believe they will be willing to allow us to completely occupy the land in the central and southern parts of Kautini, and connect it with Enona, completely ensuring the security of our newly occupied land.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For the Pentney and Karacheni tribes, their tribal settlements and towns are in the mountains to the north of Samonai, where the mountains are higher and the roads are more difficult to walk. Especially the Karacheni tribe, it is said that their settlements are in mountains thousands of meters high, so their land is more barren and their population is not large. We do not need to occupy their land, but they must surrender to the kingdom. The leaders of their tribes must hand over their children and send them to Thurii as hostages. The leader they elect must be confirmed by the kingdom before they can serve as …”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After listening to Davos's plan to deal with the Samonite tribal alliance, Clotokatax said with conviction: "Father, your plan is much better than mine! It is indeed better than mine." I think carefully!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "That's because you are too kind to the Samonai tribe, and when you consider the problem, you do not consider it from the standpoint of obtaining greater benefits for the kingdom, weakening our enemies to the greatest extent, and making them unable to rebel. "Davos pointed out pointedly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Father, but——” Clotokatax asked: “Silpini and Cavutini can accept your plan, but Pentney and Karacheni may not accept it.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Then continue fighting until they accept it. Just leave this matter to Alexis and Xantiparis. Since the war with the Samnites has already started, let's use this war, even if it costs more. We must completely solve the problem of the Samnites to prevent them from rebelling in the future!" Daves warned him earnestly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Chlotokatax nodded thoughtfully.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos turned back and said: "Herni, did you hear clearly what I just said about the plan to deal with the four major Samnite tribes?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “You hear me clearly, Your Majesty.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Then write a letter to the Senate according to what I just said, asking them to pre-arrange Samnite affairs on this basis. Then write the same letter to Alexis and Xantiparis each A letter gives them a sense of certainty and how to adjust their strategy next.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Understood, Your Majesty, I will write it now." Henepolis said and took out the papyrus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax and Tormid were still immersed in Davos's series of plans to deal with the Samnites, thinking about what impact it would have on the Samnites. It became quiet inside, so the "rustling" sound of writing could be heard.
