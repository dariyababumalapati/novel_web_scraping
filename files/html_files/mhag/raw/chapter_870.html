   Chapter 870 Time limit for defeating the enemy
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Have Mago ever been treated like this? He was almost startled, and then looked at Pretaku next to him in confusion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Preeta Kuba looked at him and said meaningfully: "Sir, this is not our instruction, but the heartfelt cheers of the people! Since the outbreak of the war, we have suffered a disastrous defeat, and the Dionia army is ravaging In our land in Sicily, Dionian warships attack our merchant ships sailing to the west of Sicily for trade from time to time. The people of the Sicilian colony are displaced, and trade has declined sharply... They are now deeply aware that Carthage needs a Heroes come to defeat powerful enemies and restore prosperity to Carthage!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “I understand, I will let them see it!” Mago looked solemn, raised his right hand, and waved vigorously to the audience around him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The cheers became even more enthusiastic.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Look, the king of Iberia is here, making himself look like a hero!” Okriton said sarcastically as he looked at the troublemaker who was surrounded by the people and walked towards the Senate.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Hero?! Then we have to wait until he defeats the Dionysians!” Tai Panlaco sneered.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "He himself brought more than 20,000 troops, and another 60,000 troops were prepared for him here. There are also 30,000 to 40,000 troops in Sicily, a total of 110,000 to 20,000 strong troops. This is the most powerful force in the history of Carthage. Army! Whoever becomes the commander of this army will probably win easily!" Another elder said disdainfully.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The senators at the door of the Senate were talking quietly. Hanno, who was standing at the front, looked calm. Although he said nothing, there were waves in his heart: He had spent more than ten years of hard work to eliminate Magonid. His family's influence on Carthage, even though he drove his immediate family out of Carthage, he was always wary of Mago. Listen to the cheers of the whole city, doesn’t it mean that the Magonides family still has great influence in Carthage! The reason why the people of Carthage were so vocal was precisely because they were worried about the war in Sicily. If he had a capable general in his hands, how could the situation in the city become like this?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Looking at Mago approaching him, Hanno felt annoyed and jealous, but his expression remained calm because he could not leave a bad impression on the people: he was the culprit who hindered Mago from leading the battle.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Welcome, Lord Mago!" Hannuo praised loudly with a smile on his face: "You are here, and there is hope for our war with Dionia! Therefore, we have gathered enough citizens for you Soldier, I have prepared enough food just to hear the news of your victory as soon as possible!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mago listened to his words of praise and looked at the seemingly sincere smile on his face, but felt sick in his heart. He couldn't help but said: "Carthage is in danger. If it weren't for the obstruction of some people, I would have been there long ago." It’s time to come!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hannuo seemed unaware, his smile remained unchanged, and he made a gesture to invite entry.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mago entered the Senate with his head held high.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Occreton approached Hanno, wanting to say something angrily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hanno stopped him with a look.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the venue, Mago gave a speech to the senators. He briefly described the dangerous situation currently facing Carthage with a serious expression, and thanked the senators for their trust in him. Finally, he made an impassioned promise: He will do his best. , reverse the current unfavorable situation, defeat the Dionia army, drive Dionia's forces out of Sicily, and at the same time force Dionia not to invade Carthage's ally Rome, forcing Dionia to a greater extent Open up its domestic trade to Carthage merchants and force it to reduce the size of its navy that threatens Carthage...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What Mago said was exactly what the senators wanted, so everyone responded with warm applause.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Okriton stood up while applauding, and said coldly: "A very exciting speech! But a few months ago, Monte Adeno also said the same, but what about the result!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A can of cold water was thrown at Margo, who was in the midst of excitement. He was even more angry that the other party actually compared himself with that incompetent person. He was furious and immediately refuted loudly: "That idiot Monte Adeno, He was originally incapable of commanding this war. If it weren't for the persistence of some people, he would never have been able to serve as commander. As a result, he regarded the war as a child's play and suffered a disastrous defeat, causing Carthage to suffer huge losses. Should this accountability be investigated to the end? ?!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hanno raised his eyebrows.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Okriton laughed and said: "Is Monte Adeno an incompetent person?! This is really funny. He has been fighting in Numbia for many years and has never suffered a defeat. He has won a large area of ​​​​land for Carthage. This His achievements are no less than what you did in Iberia, which is why the senators unanimously elected him as commander-in-chief! Even so, after suffering a failure, he was severely punished. If the Senate made If there is a problem with this punishment, then I would like to ask Lord Hanno about the losses Sicily suffered after Hilmicus and you were defeated by Dionysius more than ten years ago, resulting in the death of about half of the citizens of Carthage. A much bigger failure than Monte Adeno, but have you ever been punished like Monte Adeno?! Is that fair?!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “You’re talking nonsense!!” The scars from the past were revealed, and Mago was extremely angry and immediately cursed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hanno had an undetectable smile on his face.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Preta Kuba immediately stood up and shouted: "Master Okriton, now the army has gathered and is about to fight the Dionians, which will determine the fate of our Carthage! But you said these words at this time, I don’t know what it means to disturb the morale of the army?!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Don't scare me, Preta Kubada. I had no other intention. I just wanted to ask Mr. Mago, but before I finished asking, I didn't expect him to react so violently." Okriton shrugged. With an innocent look, he continued: "What I just wanted to say is that everyone can say good things, but to implement it in action, it is not easy for us to summon so many citizens to go out to fight! And to give this huge army It is even more difficult for the army to raise enough military food supplies! Our treasury, our taxes, the gold and silver we mined... are all invested in this war, and we cannot support this war to continue for a long time, so I I would like to ask, Mr. Mago, can you give us a specific deadline to fulfill the promise you just made?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Marco was stunned.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Okriton's words were recognized by many senators. After all, Mago and Hanno had been arguing for more than a month, which could be said to have delayed the opportunity to fight. Now that he has a large army, if he still delays, the senators should Caught blind.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even Esiyaruba took the initiative to stand up and said: "Master Mago, what Okriton said is right. The consumption of hundreds of thousands of troops is huge. We really need a more certain time limit so that the entire Carthage can be here." During this period, we gritted our teeth and persisted, and tried our best to provide supplies for the army."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Preeta Kuba winked fiercely at Mago.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mago originally thought that if he could get the full support of Carthage and set a deadline, it would not be a bad thing, but when he saw Preeta Kuba's eyes, he hesitated.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It seems that Lord Mago is not very confident in his ability to defeat the Dionians." Tai Panlaco said sarcastically.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mago glared at Tai Panlaco, and then glanced at Hanno who was also watching him. He smiled disdainfully and said loudly and seriously: "We all know that Dionia is a powerful country. We and Dionia are The war between Asia and Asia cannot end in a short time, and I know what you mean by saying that, but I am still willing to set a deadline to not only urge myself, but also give hope to the people of Carthage... 1 year! In Within a year, I will do my best to drive the forces of Dionia out of Sicily!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The main force of the Samnite coalition entered Beneventom, and the next day received the news that "Lola was besieged by the enemy".
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as Segovani got the news, he immediately called for a military meeting, and said anxiously during the meeting: "We immediately went to war to repel the Dionian coalition forces in the south, and then led the army back to aid Lola.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course Lesguk did not agree with this proposal. He patiently persuaded: "Chief Segovani, the city of Lola is strong and the defenders are not small. It is impossible for the enemy to capture it in a short time. You don't have to Too impatient. You should know that there are many enemies outside the city of Beneventum, and they have built relatively complete camps. If we attack from the front, our losses will inevitably be huge, and we may not be successful.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, with such a large army from Dionia coming from a long distance, the supply of military food has become a big problem. As long as we send several troops to sneak into the mountains, bypass their camps, and attack Abenirum and their camps. to cut off their food transportation. If the Dionians don't have enough to eat, they must be panicked and confused. Only then will we attack. Once the main force of the Dionian coalition is defeated, our next situation will be much better. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I agree with Lisguk. We have few soldiers now, so we should be cautious!" Badani said. After all, the Dionian soldiers could not threaten Pentney's territory, and he certainly did not want to take risks.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As for Kontruk, he was a little hesitant. Although Karacheni's territory was far away from the threat of Dionia's attack, as an old man who always used a tough attitude to protect the interests of the Samonite race, he adopted a prudent strategy. It was against his nature, but the Karacheni warriors had the smallest number among the four major races. After several battles, they suffered considerable losses, which forced him to pay attention to this issue, so in the end he agreed with Lesguk. suggestions.
