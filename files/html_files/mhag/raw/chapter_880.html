   Chapter 880 The ending of the Samnite coalition (2)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the word "surrender" came out of the mouth of the Beneventom envoy, Alexis was not too surprised, because except for Beneventom, the other Hilpini tribes had surrendered to Dio. After that, he learned that Karacheni's army had left the city of Beneventum, so Beneventum was already a turtle in the urn.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, Alexis said with confidence: "It is a good thing that Beneventom can surrender! However, Beneventom, as one of the initiators of this war, according to other tribes, is still the leader of this war. The main commander has caused great disaster to Dionia and its allies and must be severely punished!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the envoy from Beneventum heard this, he was frightened and said quickly: "Honorable General Alexis, Savoni has already punished Beneventum for his mistakes. The great leader Lesguk committed suicide last night. Apologize!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Lesguk is dead?!” Galni in the big tent asked in surprise.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Chief Gairni." The messenger looked at Gairni with a sad expression and said with a choked voice: "Before the chief died, he very regretted what he had done to Abenirum. He hoped that All the faults will be borne by him alone, and I hope you can spare the tribes of Beneventum!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Lesguk would not say such a thing.” Garni shook his head and sat down again, but he seemed to be in a good mood.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alexis said solemnly: "Lesguk's suicide does not absolve the Beneventum people of their responsibility! Our King Davos once wrote a letter pointing out, 'There are more than ten Beneventum people. He has been malicious towards Dionia for many years, and has been maliciously suppressing and bullying Abenirum, who has friendly relations with Dionia, and is also the main culprit in provoking this war!...'
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because you wantonly tore up the alliance, in order to avoid being provoked by your Beneventum to start another war in the future, King Daves instructed, "Beneventum must be completely integrated into the Kingdom of Dionia. Beneventum's Tribes and peoples can join the Kingdom of Dionia or move to other places in the Samonai Mountains. ’ After this war is over, the mountainous areas will be vast and sparsely populated, and there will be plenty of places that can become your settlements. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the messenger heard this, he became angry, blushed and shouted: "Is Dionia trying to use war as an excuse to take the opportunity to forcibly annex our Beneventum?! If so, we Beneventum The Tum warriors will never give in and will fight to the end! Savoni will protect us. Even if all the Dionians here are killed, they will never be able to attack the city of Beneventum!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the messenger roared angrily, he turned to look at Gairni and scolded: "You see, this is the ambition of the Dionians! Today it is Beneventum, and tomorrow it may be Abenirum, The Dionians probably want to wipe out the entire Samnite people, do you still want to be their accomplice?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Garni turned a blind eye to the envoy's words to alienate him. Alexis had already told him Davos's instructions. Of course, he was very happy with Davos's wish for him to become the leader of the Shirpini tribe. Although the most powerful Beneventum will be separated and completely become part of the Kingdom of Dionia, which is somewhat regrettable, it also means that Beneventum has suppressed Abenelu for decades. Mu's situation will no longer exist. In the future, he will have far fewer constraints on governing the entire tribe, so he can accept this.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He responded calmly: "Abenirum has joined the Kingdom of Dionia."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The messenger was stunned.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alexis said in a strong tone: "Our soldiers have long been prepared to storm the city of Beneventum! Whether to accept this condition or to fight to the end, Beneventum must give me an answer today. , otherwise we will start attacking the city tomorrow!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The messenger hurriedly returned to the city, but he didn't expect that there was a commotion in the city.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It turned out that Lesguk's tribal warriors were instigated by his relatives and believed that the leader's suicide was related to other tribal leaders' fear of death and collective forced abortion. They not only imprisoned the two tribal elders involved in the matter, but also asked other tribal leaders to One must take responsibility for this and, according to tradition, be judged and punished.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The other tribal leaders certainly couldn't accept it, and the angry Lesguk tribe warriors insisted on making them pay, leading to an escalation of the conflict.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lescuq's tribe is the largest tribe in Beneventum's territory. Other tribes can only unite to fight against it. Both sides are at war with each other and will not give in an inch.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The messenger told both parties about Dionia's harsh conditions. Although everyone finally calmed down their anger and sat together to discuss the matter, due to the lack of a leader, they argued for a long time and could not come up with a unified opinion. It was war. Or peace?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lesguk's tribe elected his eldest son to participate in the meeting. Not only did he have a firm attitude during the meeting, he wanted to fight to the death with the Dionysian coalition, but he also continued to verbally attack other leaders who proposed further negotiations. When the meeting ended, The eyes he glared at the other leaders were full of hatred, which frightened the leaders.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since Beneventum did not respond that day, Alexis kept his promise and sent a large army early the next morning to prepare to attack the city.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The morale of the Dionian coalition is very high and they have a strong desire to fight. After learning that the army dominated by the Lucanian reserve legion had defeated the main force of Kautini, the soldiers of the 10th and 11th legions certainly could not allow themselves to be outcompeted by the legion reserve soldiers. They had asked for battle many times. for the Abenirum warriors, capturing the city of Beneventum could finally take revenge and let them vent the oppression and humiliation they had suffered for more than ten years, so they were all extremely excited; for Potentia For the soldiers, capturing the city of Beneventum means that they no longer have to listen to the older generation talking about how terrible the Samnites are. They can proudly tell future generations that they have captured the largest town of the Samnites.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alexis issued a siege deployment: the Potentian army attacked the east wall, the Dionian army attacked the west, and the Abenirum army attacked the south.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alexis also placed the surrendered Shirpini warriors under the command of Garni. He could not allow the whole army to attack the city while there were some Shirpini warriors in the camp who were not sure whether they were loyal or not. Watching.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Faced with the objections of these tribes, Gairni threatened fiercely: "You once swore an oath to Lesguk. Now that Lesguk has committed suicide, naturally you no longer need to abide by this oath. Don't look for it again." Any excuse to escape this battle, I tell you, the tribes participating in this battle are allies of Dionia, and those who do not participate are enemies, you choose it yourself!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Many people secretly cursed Gairni for pretending to be a tiger, but no tribe dared to lead their troops and leave without authorization.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Garni was not polite and directly placed them at the forefront of the siege.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Dionian coalition forces were about to attack the city, but the leaders in Beneventum city did not formulate a defense plan at all because of the inconclusive dispute yesterday. Unexpectedly, the Dionian coalition forces launched an attack at dawn. Suddenly everyone panicked, and they rushed to the city with their soldiers to defend themselves. The arrangement was hasty and chaotic.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Moreover, Beneventom is a big city, and 2,000 warriors cannot cover the entire city. Seeing the tide of enemies under the city, as well as the tall siege equipment that they have never seen before, some leaders are excited and excited. I had other thoughts.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The siege battle had just begun, and several tribes responsible for defending the southern city took the initiative to open the city gates and surrendered to the Dionian coalition.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Abenirum's army took the opportunity to rush into the city, and Beneventum's defense lines collapsed. The Lescuq tribe, which resisted until the end, had to surrender even though most of its casualties were lost and the temporary leader died in the battle.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Dionian coalition captured Beneventum.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The fall of Beneventum meant that the coalition forces led by Alexis could pass through the mountain passes to the east and reach Cavutem.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Cavutini spies who had been paying close attention to the battle in Beneventum immediately conveyed the bad news back to Cavutim.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The people of Kautim were extremely panicked because most of their young and middle-aged people were led by Segovani to resist another Dionian coalition in Abela.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A few days ago, Segovani was angry at the betrayal of the Naconians, so he ordered the Naconian leaders imprisoned in Cautim to be escorted to Abela, where they were all beheaded and their heads hung in the city. head, in order to vent his inner anger and take revenge on the Naconians.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Naconian warriors headed by Vashonk were indeed angered, and they all asked Zantiparis to attack the city of Abella.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xantiparis saw that the Naconians were full of fighting spirit, and through exploration, he found that Abela was not only a small city, but also had poor defense facilities (Abela was located in the hinterland of Cavoutini and had never been threatened by foreign enemies. In addition, Surrounded by mountains that are difficult to climb, the land is barren, and their survival is threatened. The Abella people are busy plundering and have no time to repair the city), so he agreed to the request of the Naconians and transferred the initial attack on Lola to After the siege equipment used in the city was loaded, the order to attack the city was issued.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The attack is based on Naconian soldiers as the main force, Dionian soldiers as auxiliary soldiers, and Campanian Allied soldiers as backup, waving flags and shouting to build momentum.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It turned out that the generals of the Campania League army saw that Cavutini's remnants had been driven out of the Campania plain and no longer posed a threat to them, so they took action to "return to their motherland and rebuild their homes quickly." "Thinking about it, they all asked Xantiparis to resign and left. In the end, even the Naples general Aialos couldn't sit still, but at least he left 1,000 Naples soldiers.
