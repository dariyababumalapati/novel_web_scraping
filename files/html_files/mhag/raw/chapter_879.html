   Chapter 879 The outcome of the Samnite tribe alliance (1)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The center of the Afangum tribe blossomed, and the coalition soldiers killed fiercely in the rear. The Kautini warriors who were unable to defend themselves and were attacked from both sides fled in panic. Some warriors even loudly reminded other tribes: "The Nakonians have rebelled! Nako The Nians have rebelled!!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mixed with the neat and loud shouts of the Avangum people: "Revenge of the Naconians!!..." Even if there are constant fighting and screaming in this area, these sounds can still be transmitted to distant areas. , let other tribal warriors hear it, which not only made the Kautini warriors wary, but also let other Naconian tribal warriors know the situation, forcing them to take immediate action.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a result, one Naconian tribe warrior after another launched rebellions and attacked the surrounding Kautini warriors.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Originally, Segovani dispersed the Naconian tribes throughout the military formation in order to prevent them from rebelling, and at the same time force them to fight with all their strength for their survival in the military formation. Unexpectedly, instead he shot them with stones. The sudden rebellion of warriors from various tribes in Naconia caused the entire military formation of Cavutini's army to become chaotic.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Zantiparis discovered the anomaly in the enemy's formation, and took the opportunity to notify the light armored soldiers at both ends to attack inward. Coupled with the attacks of the pursuing coalition soldiers, the Cavutini army quickly changed from the original planned retreat to a complete retreat. rout.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even some Cavutini warriors who were frightened by the constant news of rebellion became suspicious and stabbed their teammates with spears who had no intention of getting close to them. Under the dim sky, the Kautini warriors had no fighting spirit. They trampled and killed each other on the way to escape, causing countless casualties.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   By nightfall, when the Dionian coalition stopped their pursuit, only nearly 2,000 Kautini warriors were able to escape, including the big leader Segovani, who finally fled into the city of Sessala. The coalition lost less than 500 people and gained support from more than 2,000 Naconian warriors, which strengthened its strength again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Early the next morning, after a night's rest, the Dionysian coalition troops divided into two groups and marched northward, aiming directly at Sessala and Abela.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At noon, the army, mainly Campania League soldiers, arrived at the city of Thessara, only to find that it had become an empty city.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It turned out that after the remnants of Cavoutini's army fled back to Sessala, Segovani, who had calmed down a little, while angrily cursing the rebellious Naconians, also realized that he could no longer stay in this city because that day When the enemy is attacking, they only need to detach part of their troops to surround Sesala, which has only 2,000 soldiers garrisoned. Then they can lead the main force to directly attack Abela, which is in the pass of the mountain pass and is undefended, thereby directly attacking the same defensive void. Cavutim, in that case, Cavutini would be finished.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hence, Segovani mobilized the entire city to relocate that night.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the Thessala people were extremely reluctant to leave, they did not want to make the same mistake as Lola, so everyone carried their belongings, supported the old and the young, and retreated towards Abela and Kautim overnight.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, when the Dionian coalition forces, mainly composed of Dionian and Naconian soldiers, arrived at the mountain pass, Segovani led only 2,000 soldiers to garrison the small town of Abela, blocking the eastward march of the coalition forces. defile.
  </font>

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the same day, some 10,000 soldiers of the 10th and 11th legions led by Cappus captured the small town of Eequium after a day of hard fighting, and fought with Alexis, who was directly west of the Samnite Mountains. The coalition forces responded and threatened to completely surround Shirpini territory.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the troops of the Kautini and Penteni tribes left one after another, the strength of the army in Beneventum was significantly weakened. In order to reduce unnecessary casualties, Lesguk had stopped attacking out of the city. Instead, Dio The Nian coalition soldiers approached the city, but they were not here to attack the city. Instead, Gairni, the leader of Abenirum, led the people to keep shouting under the city.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Gairni counted the defeats Lesguk suffered since he launched a war against Dionia without permission, as well as the specific number of casualties and captured Hilpinian warriors.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He also shouted loudly to the city: "Compatriots of Shilpini, now Aquilonia and Eequium have been captured by the Dionian coalition forces one after another, and the Shilpini territory is already surrounded by the coalition forces, so You should no longer blindly follow Lesguk and continue to fight against the Dionysian coalition, otherwise the coalition will send troops to capture your towns, destroy your settlements, capture your families, and completely destroy your tribe!... "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, he also made a promise: "As long as the tribal leaders and warriors surrender to Dionia, it would be better if Lesguk can be captured. Not only will your previous violation of Dionia be forgiven, but the territory and family will be restored." Preservation, and the originally captured warriors of the tribe will be released home, and the injured warriors will also receive careful treatment from Dr. Dionia..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Gharni's repeated shouting outside the city had a great impact on the leaders and warriors of the Shirpini tribe in the city.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lesguk began to see the leaders of the Shirpini tribes quietly gathering their own warriors and discussing something in secret, which made him secretly frightened.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not long after, the news that "Cautini's army suffered a disastrous defeat in the Campania plain" reached the city of Beneventum, which made people panic even more.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, under the repeated urging of Alexis, the leader of Aquilonia rushed to the coalition camp. He also followed Gairni and shouted outside the city, which finally led to the fact that he was originally sent to Beneventum and followed him. The Aquilonian warriors from Lesguk's expedition were the first to stand up and ask Lesguk: They should respond to the leader's call, leave Beneventum and join Dionia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Aquilonia is the third largest combined tribal town of the Shilpini tribe. After several battles, there are still more than 700 warriors, which occupies a considerable place in the Shilpini army that currently has only more than 4,000 warriors. Large proportions. And closely following Aquilonia were the warriors of Eequium, who also decided to surrender to Dionia in order to save their captured families.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The various tribes within the Shirpini tribe are equal in terms of political status. They elect a chief and obey the orders of the chief. However, this is not a legal requirement, but is based on the long tradition of the tribe, but the tradition is also It is stipulated that they can refuse to execute the orders of the great leader at any time based on their own circumstances, so whether it is the Shirpini tribe or other Samoni tribes, in fact they are still a loose political alliance within them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Perhaps because of the characteristics of the mountain people, the tribes have inconvenient transportation and unified jurisdiction. Therefore, they are more independent and free in political status, but this makes Lesguk unable to use it either politically or militarily. Coercive means were used to force him to stay (the total number of Aquilonian and Eequium warriors was 800, which also made Lesguk avoid the rat weapon).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   With no choice but to make them swear in the name of the Savoni god, Lesguk had no choice but to make them swear that they would not be enemies of all the Samoni tribes after surrendering to Dionia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Aquilonian and Equim warriors did so.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hence, Lesguk could only order: open the city gate and let the warriors of these two tribes leave.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alexis and the top leaders of the coalition welcomed them who came to surrender.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Other tribal leaders who witnessed the whole process at the city head finally no longer hesitated and made requests to Lesguk: leave Beneventum and go back to defend their homes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lesguk knew that what these people told were all lies, and he was afraid that he would really let them out of the city, and in a blink of an eye they all went to Dionia. He had expected this to happen when he let the Aquilonian and Equim warriors leave. The total number of these Hilpini warriors who had united to force the palace to go to the palace was more than 1,000. If he didn't let them leave, what would happen if they were not allowed to leave? Let them cause trouble in the city, but it will cause even greater disasters.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lesguk thought about it again and again, and finally nodded in agreement.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Shirpini tribes left one after another, causing panic in the city of Beneventum, and even affecting Karacheni's army. Their leaders and warriors asked Kontruk to leave Beneventum and return to their own country. home.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Kontruk has a stubborn and conservative character, he also knows that the defeat of the Samnite coalition is now determined. The enemy is outnumbered. It is only a matter of time before Beneventum falls. The Karacheni army continues to stay in the city, and the entire army may be annihilated. danger.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, he used the reason of "being forced by the leaders of the Karacheni tribes" and was embarrassed not to go to see Lesguk in person, so he sent a subordinate to say hello to Lesguk, and he led the team directly from Beicheng. He left the city, crossed the river, and left Beneventum.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reinforcements left one by one, causing the people in the city to fall into complete panic. The leaders of the various tribes in Beneventum came together to meet with Lesguk. Period Aiai's request: The situation is critical now, and Beneventum is unable to support itself. For the sake of all the tribes in the city, For the safety of the tribal people, I hope Lesguk can lead the entire city's army and people to surrender to Dionia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The desolate-looking Lesguk looked even more gloomy when he saw that among the leaders who came to petition were the elders of his own tribe. He was silent for a long time. Under repeated urging from the leaders, he said coldly: "Let me Think about it..." After saying that, he asked the guards to drive everyone away.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Looking at the empty living room, Lisguk's heart was also empty. He remembered what Segovani had scolded him before, "You are not worthy of being a tribal leader. You are not decisive enough in doing things, and your methods are not ruthless enough..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lesguk smiled miserably and whispered to himself: "Segovani, you are right... However, I really want to know how you, with your ruthless methods, will save Cavutim next, but unfortunately... …I can’t see anymore…”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At night, Lesguk committed suicide in the mansion. The people in the city were horrified. The leaders held urgent discussions and sent envoys to the Dionia military camp the next day.
