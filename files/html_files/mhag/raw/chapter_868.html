   Chapter 868 Family Banquet
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Sit down quickly, everyone has been waiting for you for a long time." Davos, who was sitting at the top, looked at him with concern, and then said in a gentle tone: "Now you know the disadvantages of alcoholism, you should drink in moderation in the future. ."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's too uncomfortable to be drunk. I will try not to drink in the future." This was the first time Crotokatakes was drunk. He touched his still dizzy head and responded in a low voice.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You just need to drink less, but it's impossible not to drink, otherwise you won't be able to get along better with the soldiers." A voice sounded next to him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crotokatax turned his head hurriedly and shouted kindly: "Brother! Thank you for the reminder!" Then he turned to the other side and nodded in greeting: "Hello, brother-in-law!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Patroclus smiled and nodded, and gave a friendly suggestion: "I also felt very uncomfortable when I was drunk for the first time. My team officer at that time got me honey water to drink, and I felt much better soon."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Honey water? I'll try it later." Clotokatax expressed his thanks and sat down next to Adoris.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos made a gesture to the servant standing aside, and soon the dinner was placed on the table.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos smiled, his eyes slowly swept over Adoris, Clotokatax, and Patroclus, and said in a calm tone: "There is an old saying in the East called 'Father and son go into battle.' It is said that when fathers and sons go to war at the same time, they are often very united and can win the battle. This time on the expedition to Latium, all the adult men in our family were present... I am very ashamed. It has been almost two months since I arrived here, because During this time, the war is tense and government affairs are busy. In addition, in order to avoid suspicion, I did not pay more attention to you. Today is a rare opportunity, so I asked the three of you to come over tonight. Our family will gather together to have a good meal and drink. ,say something.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I'm very happy. The battles were so frequent and fierce, but none of you were seriously injured. This is the greatest luck! So for this first glass of wine, we want to thank Hades for blessing us! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Speaking, Davos raised his wine glass.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Adoris and Patroclus also raised their glasses one after another, but Clotocathax was a little hesitant.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Cloteau, just drink honey water after you sober up.” Davos said.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   His words made Crotokatax change his mind. He asked his servant to add more water to the wine, and then poured a glass.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The four of them drank the cup after silently praying to Hades.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Your Majesty!” Patroclus put down his glass, filled it up again, and said, “I should——”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Uh!" Davos corrected solemnly: "I said this was a party at our house, why do you still call me that! What should you call me like Cynthia?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Patroclus hesitated for a moment, and then respectfully shouted: "Father!".
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Yeah!” Davos responded with a smile.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I called the wrong one, should I be punished with a drink first?" Adoris looked at Patroclus with bright eyes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Patroclus drank it all in one gulp, and then turned the empty glass to Adoris.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   To be honest, although Patroclus is Adoris's brother-in-law, they have never had dinner together. Patroclus' straightforwardness and forthrightness immediately matched Adoris's temper, and he immediately responded with a drink.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Haha, Paltrow, Cynthia is my eldest daughter. She has helped us take care of other children since she was a child, so they all admire Cynthia. If you marry her, Adoris and the others will all feel a little resentful!" Davos I deliberately said this in a joking tone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Adoris touched his nose in embarrassment, and Clotokatax was slightly shocked. However, more than two years had passed, and he had accepted this fact and forgotten the feelings in his heart.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Patroclus smiled, filled the wine glass again, and said: "Father...Father, what I just wanted to say is...the helmet that Clotho gave me was very protective, and it once saved my life. When I was defending the city of Ostia, I was fighting with the enemy. An arrow hit the side of my helmet. The helmet withstood the impact of the arrow very well. It did not cause me to feel dizzy, but provided opportunities for the enemies in front of me. …”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Patroclus rubbed his head, recalling the dangerous situation at that time, and said with lingering fear: "So, I have to toast you, Clotho, thank you very much! You saved my life!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Patroclus stood up and raised his glass to Clotocathax sincerely.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax stood up in a hurry and said: "What my father just said was wrong. We did not blame you for marrying your sister. Instead, we thanked your sister for bringing us such a good brother-in-law! Now we are a family. , we should help each other! On the contrary, according to the tradition of Dionia, I should toast you brother-in-law first! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos was very satisfied that Clotokatax was able to overcome the previous emotional entanglement and behaved so generously and appropriately. He watched with pleasure as the two clinked glasses and drank, and patted the table happily: "Yes, yes, this They are a family!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then, Davos picked up another glass of wine and said loudly: "This second glass of wine is to thank you for your outstanding performance in this war! Paltrow, as the captain of the First Army, you are rescuing Wolsey , attack the city of Rome, defend Ostia... In these difficult battles, you were calm-headed and commanded well. You took the lead in critical moments and boosted morale. You performed very well. I am proud of you!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Adoris, in the battles to intercept Roman reinforcements and capture Phedena and Gaby, you not only performed very bravely, but also led your squad well, so you were promoted to squad leader, which is not what Matonis expected. I am trying to please you because you are my son, but you have earned it through your own performance. I am proud of you!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotto, you have just turned 18 and it is your first time on the battlefield. I originally just wanted you to feel the atmosphere of the battlefield and did not intend for you to fight the enemy alone. However, you have taken the initiative to fight many times and participated in the blocking. Roman reinforcements, the defense of Ostia, the capture of Fidenae and Gabi, especially when you stormed Gabi. At the most critical moment, you bravely led the palace guards to the city, laying the groundwork for the capture of Gabi. Damn it, you are already an excellent warrior, I am proud of you!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So this glass of wine is dedicated to the three outstanding young people in our family. You have brought glory to the royal family with your outstanding performance. I thank you! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos stood up, raised his glass to the three of them with a sincere expression, and then drank it all.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Chlotocathacus, Adoris, and Patroclus were all in high spirits after hearing what Davos said. After smiling at each other, they all raised their glasses to return the favor to Davos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos filled up the wine again, looked at them, and said seriously: "This last glass of wine... To our relatives! We are fighting in the front, and they are worried in the rear! Adoris, Clotho, you two A mother sends a letter every day, and most of the content in it is about the situation of the two of you in Latium. What did you eat today? Did you participate in the battle? Were you injured in the battle?... For To reassure them, I have to spend energy every day writing nice words to comfort them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The same goes for Paltrow. The letters Cynthia writes to you every day are forwarded by me. I think they must be full of concern for you... So you must remember that the reason why we fight is for our homeland. Please don't be too obsessed with fighting and forget about your loved ones who are worried about you at the rear! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The expressions of the three people who were high-spirited just now turned solemn in an instant. Patroclus thought of his wife who loved him deeply and was still pregnant, and Clotocatacus thought of his doting mother Agnes and her stern appearance. , Krystoya’s mother, who was actually caring, and Adoris thought of Krystoya’s mother, who had always cared for him very much, and his sister who had taken care of him since he was a child. The three of them all silently picked up their wine glasses, and then spoke with emotion. Drink it all in one gulp.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There was silence in the living room for a while, and then Davos said: "Okay, we have finished the three glasses of wine, and then we can eat and chat casually. Clotto, you have a stomachache, so I made some wheat for you." Porridge, drink some first."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The servant had already brought the steaming rice porridge to Crotokatax's desk. He took a spoonful and drank it slowly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The dinner prepared for them in the evening was boiled beef and mutton, because Davos thought it would be more lively for the family to eat this, but Patroclus and Adoris had already eaten a lot at the noon banquet, so their appetites were not very strong. After just a few simple bites, Adoris couldn't help but ask: "Father, should we attack the Roman army hiding in the colonial city southwest of Latium?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes." Davos confirmed his question and said clearly: "Rome is a bad wolf. We should step up our attack while it is injured and never give it a chance to recover to prevent it from biting us again. , so I have decided to personally lead the army tomorrow to attack the Roman colonial cities in the southwest and other Latin city-states that have not yet surrendered."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Will our legion also participate?” Adoris asked hurriedly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The Second Legion will accompany me on the expedition." After Davos finished speaking, he looked at Patroclus: "The First Legion will temporarily stay in the city of Rome and work with the Lucania Reserve Army to help the administrator, Assistor. Here, maintain order and stability in the city of Rome. At the same time, you must send the injured soldiers back to Thurii, and the reserve soldiers of Thurii will also come to Rome to make up for the vacancies in your first legion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the first legion is reorganized, the second legion will rush back to the city of Rome to change defenses with you... In this way, I hope that while destroying the Roman army, the legions can regain their full combat effectiveness as soon as possible, because we have sufficient manpower, and now we have Sufficient military ration reserves. "

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thanks to Sniper No. 11 for the reward! Your support is my motivation to write! !
