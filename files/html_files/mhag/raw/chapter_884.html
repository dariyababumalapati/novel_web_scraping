   Chapter 884 The siege of the remaining Roman army
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But after listening, Midorades was still confused: "It is regrettable that the Greeks were defeated in the end, but what does this have to do with us Dionia?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Henepolis, who had deliberately betrayed himself before, laughed and said: "Because some Alenians fled to Italy and established Aelia with other Greek colonists. This history is engraved in Apollo in Aelia. On the stone tablet in the temple. The Elians are now citizens of Dionia, so the Alenia they once established should also belong to Dionia!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Henepolis's explanation was somewhat unreasonable, but Midorades took it for granted. He immediately expressed his position: "The Third Fleet will recapture Alenia from Carthage and wash away the Greeks' past mistakes." Shame!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos was satisfied with his statement and further encouraged: "Go back and tell the crew of the Third Fleet that recapturing Alenia will not only hit the Carthaginians greatly, but also encourage the Greek city-states in the Western Mediterranean. , deepen the friendly relationship with Masselia, and become the hero praised in their hearts!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And as far as I know, Alenia has a large-scale port with complete facilities. It is a military port and a commercial port combined into one. It can be used as a docking place for all the warships of the Third Fleet, which can avoid you from traveling back and forth. bitter. After taking Alenia, the Third Fleet can use it as a base to harass Sardinia, which is next to Corsica, attack the mining teams on the island, destroy their towns and villages, and attack their cargo ships... …”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Midorades said emotionally: "Your Majesty, please don't worry, I will make it impossible for the Phoenicians on these two islands to transport a piece of metal!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos saw that Midorades was too excited and couldn't help but remind him: "Now I can't spare any troops to support you. The mission of attacking Corsica and Sardinia can only rely on the Third Fleet itself." , so you have to be bold but also cautious at the same time, cherish your soldiers, and don't let them suffer too many casualties, which will make subsequent plans impossible to carry out!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos’ words made Medorad suddenly feel more pressure.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Crotocatacus asked: "Father, will our military action on Corsica make the Etruscans dissatisfied and have other ideas?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, Crotokatax had discussed this issue with Davos in private before, and raising it at this time was just a subtle reminder to Davos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos secretly praised his son's attentiveness and consideration, and then said sternly: "Don't worry about this. Although the Etruscans often have trade relations with Carthage, they are no longer allies, and because of Carthage's powerful We are dissatisfied with supporting Rome, not to mention that the Etruscan city-states in the south have just formed an alliance with us..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then, Davos looked at Midorades again: "However, try not to let your warships appear on the sea belonging to the Corsican land controlled by the Etruscans, and do not let soldiers enter their territory." Territory to avoid excessive stimulation. We are originally afraid of our powerful Etruscans...Other than that, I have no other requirements. How to attack Corsica and Sardinia is up to you. I Don’t interfere.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos said this, which made Midorades feel more pressure. He took a deep breath and said: "Yes... yes, Your Majesty!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thormid looked at Midorades's leaving figure and couldn't help but said: "He is a little nervous."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's a good thing to be nervous, so that he will be cautious when taking actions. Even if the third fleet does not achieve any decent results, as long as the fleet hangs around these two islands, it will cause a lot of trouble to the Carthaginians. What I'm afraid of is that Midorades is overconfident, loses vigilance, and takes risky actions, causing heavy losses to the Third Fleet and weakening our advantage, just like... Alas!" Davos's words stopped suddenly, and then he said seriously He sighed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tormid knew that Davos must have thought of Sekerian and the Sicilian fleet again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Martius walked into the big tent again: "Your Majesty, the commander of the Martonis army sent a messenger to report that Aricia has surrendered!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos had a smile on his face: "Hades bless you, there is so much good news today!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   No wonder he was so happy. Aresia is not far from Tustron, just west of Lake Alba Longa. It is a very ancient Latin city-state. It has been the center of the western Latin region since ancient times, especially in Alba Longa. After the destruction of Balonga. It can be seen from its name that this Latin city-state has a very close relationship with Diana Aresia, the hunting goddess worshiped by the Latins. It is for this reason that it once united with the Latin city-states in the west to tenaciously resist the rise of the Rome, but after many defeats, it had to join the Latin League led by the Romans.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Davos personally led the army out of Rome, he first stationed himself outside Tustron (the original Roman camp) and divided his forces to attack several Latin city-states not far to the west of Tustron, with the focus being Aresia. Under the coercion of the army, other city-states surrendered one after another. Only the proud Aresians refused to surrender to Dionia. So Davers ordered: Martonis led the second and sixth legions to attack Aresia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Several days of continuous attacks finally bore fruit.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Davos's smile disappeared in the blink of an eye, he was followed by a stern tone: "If it were not for the feelings of the Roman civilians, Latin city-states like Aresia that dared to resist us should have suffered like Gabi. But even if it surrenders, you can't let it go lightly! Herni, go and notify Tapirus and ask him to talk to the Aresians immediately. Since Aressia is the sacred grove of the goddess of hunting, I can make Aresia a holy place worshiped by all Latins, replacing Alba Longa. But from now on, Aresia is not allowed to build walls, form armies, have a population of not more than 5,000, and is open to everyone. Open, and its safety is guaranteed by Dionia..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Understood, Your Majesty. Well...it is said that because of this Diana, Aresia is also a famous medical center in the Latin region..." Henipolis reminded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos curled up his lips slightly: "Can Aresia's medical skills be comparable to Dionia's? I think this responsibility should be handed over to Hades!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, it is a good thing that Aresia surrendered, but it is a pity that it failed to lure out the Roman army!" Tormid said with some regret.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos smiled slightly and said nonchalantly: "The Romans have been fooled once, so they will naturally become more cautious. Now their main force is still stationed in Satnicum, and it seems that they are ready to defend it to the death. This It is also a good thing that without the support of the Romans, Aresia also surrendered, and other Latin city-states in the west will soon make their choices."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this point, Davos's eyes became sharp, and he said firmly: "Tormid, you go and inform the whole army to be ready. Leave Tustron tomorrow and march southwest to Satni. Build a camp north of Qom, it’s time to completely deal with the Romans!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos’s words excited everyone in the big tent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, I will notify the legions right away!" Tormid responded excitedly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Also... before we sent envoys to these Latin city-states to persuade them to surrender, Adi had the most determined attitude and beat our envoys severely..." Davos said in a cold tone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It is said that the Roman dictator Camillus lived in Adi for a long time and received strong support from Adi in the battle to expel the Gauls. Therefore, Camillus had a close relationship with Adi. Camillus The Roman Senate often gives Adi a lot of care, so it is not surprising that the Adi people do this. But then, for the survival of their own city-state, the Adi people may have to give up their support for Camillus." Henibo Rhys reassured.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Since the burning of Ostia, Addi will be very important for our attack on the main Roman force entrenched at Satnicum, because it is not far from Antium and not too far from the camp we are going to build, and it is It also has a large port..." Davos squinted his eyes, with light shining in the slits of his eyes: "We need to completely control this town to transfer and transport the army's food supplies, so we cannot accept Adi's surrender. But to completely capture it!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Outside the city of Satnicum, thousands of Roman citizens were working tirelessly to build defensive facilities, reinforcing the city walls, setting up deer villages under the city walls, digging trenches wide and deep, setting up multi-layered traps, and setting up multiple layers of traps between the traps. A sentry tower, expanding the entire defense range outwards... The entire city defense model is very similar to the defensive camps usually built by the Dionysian army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because the person who undertook this task was Titus, who first commanded the army to attack Ostia. He deeply realized the power of Dionia's defense system from his failure, so he transplanted it after making slight changes. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, he was standing on the top of the city supervising the progress of the entire project. Although he saw that the entire defense facility was gradually taking shape due to the efforts of sweaty soldiers, there was no trace of joy on his face, but a look of depression.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “General, Lord Quintus is here.” His subordinates reminded him in a low voice beside him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hearing this, Titus turned around and glanced at Quintus, who was walking up the stone stairs to the city. The annoyance on his face flashed away.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Hey, Titus!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Looking at Quintus walking towards him, Titus’ face showed no enthusiasm: “When did you come back? Have all the defense facilities in Antium been completed?!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There was a hint of questioning in Titus' tone. Although Quintus was a little unhappy, he still explained: "Antium only has more than 3,000 citizen soldiers. Pantius' foot injury has basically healed. He One person can complete this task, but me being there would be a hindrance, so I came back yesterday.”
