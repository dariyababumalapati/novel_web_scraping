   Chapter 856 Marching to the Samonai Mountains
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Of course I understand what they think.” Davos smiled confidently: “They want to become the heroes of Rome again, then I will give them this opportunity and see if their fantasy can finally come true!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing this, Henepolis immediately lost his worries and wanted to write down the scene immediately as an important material for his biography.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Publius had mixed emotions. On the one hand, he was happy that he had fulfilled his promise and settled his worries. On the other hand, he was also heartbroken by Davos's magnanimity and heroism, not to mention the struggle of the remaining forces of Rome. Have no hope.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, what they didn't know was that the reason why Davos made this decision was mainly because Davos considered the following factors: First, Capitoline Mountain is located in the city, and there are five or six thousand people on the mountain. If he really starves to death because of running out of food, he is afraid that it will cause a plague, which will bring huge trouble to the Dionian army during the war, and will not be conducive to the rapid restoration of prosperity of the Roman city;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Second, the deaths of thousands of people in the city were too tragic. Not only did Davos himself feel unbearable, but it would also make the Romans who had surrendered to Dionia feel miserable, thus affecting the development of the Kingdom of Dionia. The look and feel is not conducive to their integration;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Third, he had learned from Publius before that the families of most of the noble soldiers in the army under Camillus are on the Capitoline Mountains. Once they have them, Dionia will be even more powerful. So that they can deal with the Roman army retreating in Satnicum.

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After getting Davos’s consent, Publius went up the mountain again, and the two sides quickly reached an agreement.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The next day, the people on the mountain were sent back down the mountain, and the Roman senators also followed the agreement and allowed a detachment of soldiers from Dionia to enter the mountain to supervise the entire process (mainly to see whether the Roman senators complied with the agreement, leaving only 500 soldiers) people).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Roman people who came to the foot of the mountain were escorted (more often supported) by Dionysian soldiers to the designated place and imprisoned. There was sadness on their faces, but more of a sense of relief. After all, the days of starvation were finally over. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Roman civilians also came to the square to watch the excitement. When they saw the noble family members that they had envied in the past, now they all had haggard faces and were in a daze. While they felt happy, they also felt sad at the same time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Potitus, Marugiressis and other Roman elders, as well as hundreds of remaining Roman citizen soldiers, stood on the top of the cliff, watching their relatives enter the city occupied by the enemy, until the entire Capi The empty silence on Mount Torin returned again, and they still stood like stone statues for a long time...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a long time, the coughs of several old senators broke the deathly silence.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Scipio shouted to the soldiers: "Citizens, we must defend this place with all our strength! Guard our Roman temple! Waiting...waiting for the final arrival of victory!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Roar!!!..." The soldiers roared in unison, and the roar was more tragic.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………
  </font>

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Aquilonria, one of the three important towns of Shirpini (the other two are Beneventum and Abenirum), is located in the city of Venosa in the Pucetti region of the Kingdom of Dionia It is more than 50 miles to the northwest (this is just a straight line distance, in fact, the distance on foot is doubled). The distance to the southwest of Asculum in Dauni area is less than 50 miles. In the past, it has been used as Hill many times. The Pinians invaded the forward base of the Apulian lowlands (including this time), and it benefited from it and became the most powerful tribal joint settlement in the southeastern part of the Shilpini territory, and also became the Shilpini tribe. A powerful barrier to the southwest.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Its city is built on a hill with a height of 500 meters, and is surrounded by rolling hills with an average height of about 300 meters. Let alone attacking, it will take a lot of effort for the army to get there.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since Alexis was determined to capture Aquilonia, he naturally made careful preparations. He mobilized the light infantry and light armored brigades of the 11th Legion, and then added two heavy infantrymen from the 10th Legion. The brigade and the light armored and light infantry brigade, plus the engineering battalion, medical battalion, supply battalion, and mountain reconnaissance team, have a total of more than 6,000 people, and there is also a large number of pack teams, which can supply the army with more than ten people. Food for the day, and ten Abeni Roma sent by Gairni to serve as guides.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At dawn, he led his army from Venosa, headed north to the south bank of the Ofanto River, and then marched upstream along the Ofanto Valley. The march was smooth along the way and was not disturbed by the Samnites.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thinking about it, it is understandable. The Samnites were severely damaged in the first two battles, and now they have concentrated their main force to attack the Campania League. How many young and middle-aged people are left in the entire territory who can fight. Therefore, the smooth march along the way made Alexis even more confident in taking Aquilonia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the afternoon, the Dionysian army arrived at a bend in the upper reaches of the Ofanto River, which happened to be the confluence of Ofanto and a larger tributary. Therefore, the terrain was relatively flat, the area was relatively open, and it happened to be in It is ten miles due south of the city of Aquilonia. This is the campsite Alexis selected after he learned about the surrounding terrain in detail from the Abenirum guide before setting off, because the northern part of the river bend It also happens to face the narrow lowland between the mountains (the height of this lowland is also tens of meters), through which one can approach the mountain ridge where the city of Aquilonia is located.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hence, he ordered the army to seize the time to build a camp on the south bank of the river bend.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldiers of the entire army immediately began to act quickly according to the division of labor in advance: the engineers surveyed the surrounding terrain and determined the area of ​​the main camp; the soldiers used sickles and axes to cut the weeds and trees in the area, then leveled the ground and built Put up a wooden fence... The most important thing is to burn as much thatch as possible in the swamp area on the shore to smoke out the mosquitoes hiding in it. Fortunately, the Ofanto River is not a big river and rarely floods, so the swamp area in the Reach is very small, but the fire and smoke will definitely attract the attention of the surrounding Samonite tribes, but in order to ensure that the soldiers have adequate rest and Being healthy and having enough strength and energy to cope with the tough battle ahead, Alexis believed it was worth it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to initially build the camp and lay the foundation for the next attack, Alexis also asked people to light fires around the camp at dusk to illuminate the hard work of the soldiers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldiers also knew that this place was no other place. The terrain was unfamiliar and complex. There were not only wild animals, snakes and insects, but also fierce enemies in the mountains. Therefore, there was no need for the team officers to urge them. They were building the camp regardless of fatigue, because they knew that only by building a good camp , they can sleep well in this dangerous mountain.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After evening, the camp began to take shape: a wooden fence was built on the outside, and a simple deer camp was built outside the wooden fence. A pieced-together sentry tower was erected inside the wooden fence and at the four corners of the camp. A rectangular tent, these tarpaulins sewn with animal skins are strong and have a large coverage. They can completely cover the space inside the tent. They can not only prevent snake and insect bites, but also protect against wind, frost, rain and snow. Each tent can accommodate a squad of soldiers to rest, just like the army camp in the territory. This allows extremely familiar comrades to relax and sleep quickly in an unfamiliar battlefield environment, and it is also easier for the squad leader to manage.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   One brigade occupies an area in the camp, with a large gap between it and the tent area of ​​another brigade. The six brigade are arranged in a ring, surrounding the medical battalion, engineering battalion, and supply camp (usually because of the supply camp) The pack animals inside have a strong smell and are noisy, so they are often placed on one side of the camp. However, this time because the camp is not perfect and the defense is weak, it is very vulnerable to attack when placed outside the camp. Moreover, when fighting in the mountains, it is difficult to transport food. Pack animals are extremely important). In the center of the camp is the commander's tent. A large brazier stands outside the tent. The continuous burning flame allows the officers and soldiers in the camp to burn fire even in the dark. Find the commander's location.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While the soldiers were building the camp, Alexis arranged for a company to take a full rest. When all the soldiers in the army began to sleep, the company began to stand guard, watch, and patrol the camp in the dark.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lachelesis, a Messapian, was the flag-bearing hero in the triumphal ceremony of Thurii two years ago and is now a company captain. As the commander of the company on duty tonight, he assigned his four squads to be responsible for standing guard in the four directions of the camp, east, west, north, and south. He also solemnly told the four squad leaders: "Be sure to keep your eyes open and observe what's going on outside the camp. If anything is abnormal, report it immediately! If anyone is careless or even lazy to sleep, I will definitely punish them with military law without mercy!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After arranging the mission, he personally followed the first detachment to patrol the north of the camp because he knew that there was a high possibility of enemies appearing in this direction.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Late at night, the soldiers had already fallen asleep, but there was no silence outside the camp. There were howling wolves in the forest, frogs croaking by the river, birds chirping in the swamp, and various insects in the grass. The sound of singing and gurgling water... This is the most beautiful melody of nature.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But this harmony will soon be broken. Waterbirds slapped the water in panic, frogs stopped chirping alertly, and noisy footsteps sounded from the other side of the river...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Company Captain, there are enemies!” the soldier reminded on the watchtower.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Don't be anxious, first see how many enemies there are!" Rachaelesis said calmly. He couldn't disturb the commander's rest just because there were only a few enemies to harass him. That would only leave Alexis with a lot of trouble. Impression of incompetence.
