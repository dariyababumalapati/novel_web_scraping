  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Martius brought him a portion of food, and he began to eat the food and chat with the soldiers through an interpreter.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This was the first time for Roman civilians to dine with a king. Not only did this king hold a lot of power, but he was also rumored to be a descendant of a Greek god, so they were both curious and nervous. However, they saw that this king had no pretensions and had a very unusual attitude. After gently chatting with them about their parents' personal problems, everyone gradually let go of their restraints and boldly talked to Davos about some of the problems they were facing now, and Davos responded patiently one by one, so Soldiers kept coming, which made the guards even busier, but the atmosphere became more and more lively.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the end of the banquet, Davers asked: "There will be a football game next. What preparations do you have for it?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldiers responded in a variety of ways, all expressing roughly the same meaning: Although they also wanted to participate, they had no understanding of the sport and were afraid of making a fool of themselves in the competition.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos told them with a smile: "In the Kingdom of Dionia, rugby is very popular among citizens. The competition is fierce and exciting, and can show the players' strength, speed, intelligence, and overall tactical cooperation. I believe that after you come into contact with it, You will also fall in love with it very quickly.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos continued to surprise them. He said: "This sport was inspired by Hades in my dream and then taught it to the Dionian soldiers, so don't worry, I will teach you soon." Learn how to play rugby, and I will personally take you to the game..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldiers were very excited after hearing this and actively asked to participate. Bursts of laughter erupted from time to time in Marseille Square.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Considering that there are ten teams participating in the afternoon rugby match, they are the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th legions, the 1st and 2nd cavalry legions, the Lucanian reserve legion, and the Roman reserve team, the game The venues are held in the Colosseum and the Place de Mars, and three competition venues have been opened up in the vast Place de Mars.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition to the soldiers who need to be stationed at the city head and ready to defend against foreign enemies at any time, the soldiers sent out to scout the enemy's situation around Rome, and the soldiers who patrol the streets and maintain order, there are not only soldiers from various legions, but also Dionia who come to Rome for trade. Businessmen and entourage flocked to the stadium to watch the game, which also attracted some people from Rome and surrounding towns such as Viai and Fidenae.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition to drama and sports competitions, the entertainment that the Romans could watch in the past was gladiator competitions. This was a cruel entertainment that the Romans learned from the Etruscans. Through the killing of slaves in the arena, they gave people The audience brings bloody sensory stimulation. Especially in the past ten years, with the increase in wars and the increase in prisoners, the number of gladiator competitions in Rome has gradually increased.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was their first time to watch a rugby match in Dionysia. The large-scale game scene and fierce physical confrontation first attracted their attention. It didn't take long for them to discover the overall coordination of offense and defense between the two teams. It was also very interesting to fight wits and courage in the fast movement. All these made them feel The profoundness and fun of this sport are revealed; every time the referee blows the whistle and calls a penalty, the coach on the sidelines changes players and formations in a timely manner, and every player comes off the field and claps to the sidelines, they also realize the importance of this sport. Rigorous, formal, and elegant.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So, the complicated rules of the game did not give the Roman people a headache. Instead, they made these Romans who were accustomed to making laws and abiding by the laws to ponder the mysteries more carefully. After a few games, they, like other legionnaire spectators, applauded every offensive score by the players on the field and sighed for every mistake...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Divers really fulfilled his promise and personally took the Roma players to the game.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The spectators on the sidelines immediately let out exclamations and cheers, but the players of the second legion who were the opponents were a little unhappy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As the coach, the commander of the Second Army, Matonis, immediately came over to protest.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But Daves said: "These Roman soldiers have never been exposed to rugby before. This is the first time they play against you. If I don't play, you will win easily and it will be unfair to other legions..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At Davos’s insistence, the members of the Second Legion had no choice but to accept.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, Davers is the quarterback because he can lead the team in this way. Although he is 40 years old, he insists on exercising every day and has good physical fitness. Moreover, the members of the second legion have changed when facing the king they usually admire. He had to be a little timid and did not engage in fierce confrontation with him, allowing Davers to organize the offense more easily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The news that "King Davos is playing" soon spread throughout the legions. This is a rare sight in more than ten years! Soldiers flocked to the stadium one after another, three floors away and three outside, surrounding the stadium. Every catch and throw by Davers would cause thunderous cheers from the outside, which also gave the Second Legion It caused a lot of psychological pressure on the team members.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Under his command, the Roma players gradually began to play decently and even scored a touchdown. Coupled with the Romans' natural tenacity and tenacious defense, the score never opened.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This made the members of the Second Army a little anxious, their movements became louder, and the confrontation became fierce.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Under such circumstances, Davos began to receive heavy attention, and was even knocked to the ground by a stunned opponent on one occasion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The spectators outside the field screamed, and Matonis and the players were so frightened that they hurried over to offer condolences.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos got up, shook his head, tried his best to smile, and then comforted the bewildered perpetrator, telling him in a gentle tone: "I'm fine, this is how football should be played!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This heartwarming scene once again made the audience on the sidelines burst into warm applause.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the game restarted, Matonis had an idea and shouted to the bench: "Adoris! Adoris!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Wearing a simple competition uniform, Adoris immediately ran to Matonis and said excitedly: "Legion Commander, it's my turn to play?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes." Matonis said with certainty: "After you come on the field, serve as central defense and completely defend the opponent's quarterback for me!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Ah? Defend me...father!” Adoris was dumbfounded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "There is no other way. No one else dares to seriously defend His Majesty. Only you can!" Matonis shrugged helplessly, then looked at him and said in a deep voice: "Listen, kid, we can't lose here. Beginners - Romans, otherwise the Second Legion will become a joke to all the legions in Dionia, as a Second Legion soldier, do you want this?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “No!” Adoris replied without hesitation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Very good, go out and defend!” Matonis encouraged him loudly and pushed him onto the court.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The next step was the attack of the Roma reserve team. After the two sides were in position, Davers saw Adoris standing opposite his teammates in front and was slightly taken aback: "Adoris, you are on the field."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Father, I...I won't let you pass the ball easily again!" Adoris said slightly nervously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos raised his eyebrows: "Oh, let's try it."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Adoris did not have as many scruples as other teammates. Although he was a little cautious at first, he gradually relaxed his hands and feet, and there was no scene of father and son chasing each other, which caused the soldiers outside the field to laugh.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Roman people who didn't know the reason also laughed after asking about the reason.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a result, there was fierce fighting on the court and constant laughter off the court.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, once the players of the second legion were serious and quarterback Davers was restricted, the Roman soldiers, who were novices, were naturally no match. However, when the game was over, many players walked off the field reluctantly. Just this One game made them fall in love with this sport.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When King Davos came off the field, the audience on the sidelines chanted for him to continue playing. Davos smiled and waved to the audience around him to express his gratitude.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Due to time constraints, after the first round of eliminations, the second round begins immediately. Each legion has thousands of soldiers, all of whom can play rugby and can be rotated at any time. There will be no shortage of players at all, and there is no need to rest. In the end, The final is the first army vs the second army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two top legions in the kingdom not only compete in the military, but also often compete with each other in other aspects. Naturally, they tried their best in this game, so the game was quite fierce, and so did the spectators on the sidelines. They looked very nervous and couldn’t help but cheer for both sides.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   An interesting scene appeared again in the game: Matonis once again used his trump card, sending Adoris to specifically attack Patroclus, the quarterback of the first legion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This scene of brother-in-law versus brother-in-law was staged again, adding a bit of fun to the tense game. Davos also laughed happily off the court.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It happened to be a crucial tackle from Adoris that led to Patroclus' drop ball, allowing the Second Army to narrowly win the championship by one point.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   By the end of the game, it was almost dusk, but the lively atmosphere in the city had not dissipated.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldiers of each legion were still discussing the mistakes and regrets in the game fiercely. The Roman soldiers and the people were still recalling the joy and excitement that the rugby game had brought to them. Of course, King Davos was also in the conversation. They all Unexpectedly, the normally aloof King of Dionia would be so approachable and able to mingle with ordinary people. He was closer to the people than the Roman senators who claimed to be the "father of the people". This made them favor the Kingdom of Dionia even more. layer.

   "Father! I'm sorry, I'm late!" Crotokatax hurried into the living room and said apologetically, because his voice was still a little hoarse because he had just sobered up.
