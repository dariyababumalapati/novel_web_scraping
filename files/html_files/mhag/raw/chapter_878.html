   Chapter 878 Battle of Lola (3)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But this did not stop the Greek heavy infantry from advancing, but forced them to rush forward desperately. They all remembered what the team officers warned them before the war: "You must spare no effort and rush forward regardless of everything. As long as you catch up with those The cowardly Cavutini enemies, keep them from throwing javelins, and then we will be safe!…”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The third wave of javelin attacks from Cavutini's military formation did not come immediately because the distance was too close. Not to mention there was no time to throw, and there was no time to even exchange positions with the warriors in the front row who had just finished throwing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the war began, Kautini warriors and even Samnite warriors, under the leadership of their tribal leaders, generally followed traditional combat routines, but their actions were basically free. They could make their own choices based on changes in battlefield conditions. Whether it is attacking or retreating, because its formation is very loose and the intervals are relatively large, the entire military formation is flexible during the battle.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now all the Kautini warriors (including the big leader Segovani) began to turn around and run back. They were not afraid of such an attack by the enemy because they firmly believed that the Greeks could not run away from them. When people no longer have physical strength, it will be time for them to attack at will.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Compared to the heavy infantry in the center, the lightly armed coalition infantry on both wings sprinted faster. The Cavutini warriors only threw the first round of javelins, causing some damage, and then had to start retreating. In fact, judging from the equipment of both sides, they can rush forward to fight each other, but based on the habit of long-term fighting (using javelins to cause chaos to the opponent before fighting at close range), and the fear of being entangled, they will be attacked by the approaching enemy. surrounded by the enemy, these tribal leaders were not so selfless, letting the warriors of their own tribe attract enemies for others.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As for the light armored soldiers at both ends of the military formation, there were no Campanian warriors in front of them. These Dionian citizens from the Lucanian mountainous area, without enemy obstruction, stretched out their strong legs and enjoyed themselves. Running, in fact, their position was almost level with the front-line warriors of Cavutini on the inside, but they did not turn to the inside to attack, but continued to move forward.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Campania cavalry originally on the outside of the left wing were faster, and the running horses had brought them to the side and rear of Cavutini's army formation, but they did not have the courage to directly intercept the hundreds of retreating enemies. Instead, he just waved his lance and approached them from the side, hoping to force them to go to the middle, thereby blocking the enemy's passage in other positions and slowing down the retreat of the entire army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But after the Cavutini warriors threw javelins and shot down a dozen cavalrymen, these Campanian cavalry no longer dared to approach the enemy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was supposed to be a fierce battle, but unexpectedly it turned into a large-scale running competition. On the long front of more than three miles, both the Dionian coalition and the Cavutini warriors were working hard. The running caused the ground to rumble and dust to fly everywhere.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a period of running, the Dionian heavy infantry, who was starting to get a little out of breath, heard the gasping shouts of the officers: "Throw...throw away the long shield...throw away the long shield!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   They did so without hesitation, and once they threw away their heaviest long shields and just held the bayonet, their bodies felt relaxed. Their speed was maintained, and the distance from the Cavutini warriors was not widened.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This was originally a planned plan, and the Campanian heavy infantry was influenced by it. Under the leadership of the generals headed by Aialos, they also threw away their round shields one after another.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Campanian heavy infantry who did not wear helmets and did not hold round shields were indeed a little uncomfortable at first, but they gradually adapted as they kept running.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Cavutini warriors thought that the Greeks would stop as usual after a charge, but they did not expect that the Greeks would not stop running. Although they looked back and saw that the other party had thrown away their helmets and shields. Logically speaking, this was the best time to attack with a javelin, but the two sides were too close. Throwing a javelin requires a little preparation time, and this In just a few seconds, the enemy may rush in front of them. When the entire army is retreating, no tribal leader will take the initiative to ask the people to stop and attack. They will only think: faster, and then attack again. Hurry up! After running for a while, these iron cans will lose their energy! …
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But in fact, it was the Cavutini warriors who felt weak first. They were eager to rescue Lola and marched all the way without rest or food. When they arrived here, they were already very tired. Coupled with the sudden and intense running, their muscles all over the body were exhausted. They all began to feel sore. The reason why they were still persisting was because of the tough character of the mountain people. In order to keep themselves running, they also began to throw away the long shields in their hands...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Segovani never expected that the enemy, with the Campanians as the main force, would adopt such a way to conduct the battle, and they were still using the previous combat methods to deal with the different enemies. When he felt sore all over and had difficulty breathing, and the guards around him were gasping for breath, he suddenly realized that the enemy's strange attack method might have hit their weak point, but at this moment, even if he wanted to let everyone It is impossible for the army to stop and fight back, because the battle has already begun and the whole army is running, making it impossible to convey orders.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The dizziness caused by fatigue and cerebral ischemia prevented Segovani from thinking carefully. He simply said: Let's compete to see who can run!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a period of running, the entire Dionia coalition military formation has turned into a huge crescent formation with the center back and the wings protruding forward. The array is no longer continuous and there are many gaps, especially in the center. This worried Zantiparis’ entourage who was following the team: “General... if you continue running like this, the gap in the array in the middle will... become wider and wider. If the enemy takes the opportunity to attack... but Trouble! Do you want... do you want the light armored force to attack now?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Segovani can no longer command the entire Cavutini army, nor can Zantiparis, but he can still command the Dionian army, especially the light armored soldiers at both ends, because he has been using reconnaissance cavalry to fight with them Stay in touch.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   His men were paying attention to the heavy infantry in front, while he, who was riding a horse, kept looking at the Cavutini warriors in front. Their swaying backs and heavy steps allowed him to feel the difficulty of their running. The most important thing was It's because the distance between them and their own soldiers has never been widened.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It can be seen that his use of this tactic has seen results. Both sides have exhausted their physical strength, but for the Cavutini warriors, they have lost the speed that is the most troublesome for the Campanian soldiers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hence, he said confidently: "Don't worry, let them continue chasing."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Zantiparis was not afraid of the Cavutini warriors stopping to attack, because a close fight was exactly what the coalition wanted. Even if they tore up the coalition's formation, he still believed that the final victory belonged to the coalition because he had the greatest confidence. From the 4,000 Lucanian reserve legion soldiers, they are all young citizens who were personally selected by him and have strong bodies and rigorous training. They are familiar with the Dionian legion system and their fighting spirit will not be confused by friendly forces. If it is shaken, it can rely on its tight organization to gain an advantage in the melee.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Furthermore, Zantiparis has another expectation, an expectation that can completely change the entire battle.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Zantiparis' eyes searched among the densely packed Cavutini warriors in front: there was red everywhere, who are the Naconian warriors? !
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, 500 tribal warriors from Afangum, the second largest tribe in Naconia, were located in the middle left of the center of Kautini's army. Wasonk was not idle during the retreat. On the one hand, he sent his men to gather the soldiers to prevent them from running away; on the other hand, he also asked his men to convey his hints.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The persistent pursuit of the Dionian coalition allowed Vasonk to see the determination of the Greeks to fight (this was rarely seen in previous battles with the Campanians), and he was worried that he would keep running like this. If the Kautini army really gets rid of the Dionia coalition, they will lose a great opportunity to break away from Segovani's control.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since we can no longer contact other Naconian tribes, we might as well go it alone! ... Vasonk decided not to wait any longer. He took a deep breath, resolutely raised the spear in his hand high in the air, and shouted angrily: "Naconians, revenge!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The surrounding guards who had been prepared immediately shouted: "Naconians, revenge!!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Suddenly other Naconian warriors responded. While shouting, they thrust their spears at other warriors of the neighboring Kautini tribe.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before the war, the neighboring tribal leaders privately accepted Segovani's order to monitor and alert the Naconian tribe. However, after the war began, the soldiers were focused on retreating. He was so anxious that he had no energy to take care of anything else. At the same time, he gradually lost his defense against the Naconian soldiers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Unexpectedly, a sudden change occurred. The warriors of the Afangum tribe launched attacks in all directions, stabbing down many Kautini warriors at once. The other Kautini warriors were shocked, and their first reaction was not to fight back, but They wanted to avoid these crazy Naconian warriors and continue to retreat, because they did not forget that there were enemies chasing after them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But they all fled to the outside, which naturally blocked the retreat path of the soldiers behind, causing the area that suddenly became chaotic to spread outward.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Cavutini warriors behind were only blocked for more than ten seconds. The coalition soldiers chasing them had already arrived, and stabbing spears suddenly pierced them.
