  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Segovani was annoyed, but he had to comply with this decision.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since Alexis learned that the Samnite main force was stationed in Beneventum, he no longer sent troops to attack the city of Beneventum and withdrew the ballistae team. However, the improvement and reinforcement of the entire camp continued. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the intensity of the Samnite attacks on the coalition camps is increasing, the increasingly complete camps provide adequate protection for the soldiers, and the Potentia and Abenirum warriors who have not fought in more than ten years are also I have gained a lot of experience in successful defenses one after another, and my response has become more and more appropriate.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Amidst the constant fighting, the camp of the Dionysian coalition dug deep trenches, built thick earthen forts, erected strong wooden fences, and erected towering sentry towers. There are dense deer villages and traps...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldiers sent by the Samnite coalition to attack the food road were idle because Alexis had stored enough food in the camp in advance and there was no military food transportation for the time being.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The next day, bad news came to Bereventum—the city of Aequum was besieged by the Dionysian army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Eequium, a Shirpinian town, is located due east of Beneventum, on the edge of the eastern Samnite mountains, not far from the Dauni region, and is neither located like Aquilonia. It is easy to defend and difficult to attack on the top of the mountain. Unlike Bereventum, it has a large population. Half of the not many people were recruited by the tribal coalition, and the Dionian army surrounding it is said to be nearly Thousands of people.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The four chiefs all knew that without reinforcements, Equium would fall very quickly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But Lesguk saw Segovani sneering at him and remembered what he had said to persuade him yesterday, so he did not mention the reinforcements at all. Instead, he was thinking about how to persuade the Eequium soldiers in the army and appease the morale of the army. Floating other tribesmen.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But Badani said worriedly: "The Kingdom of Dionia has a large population and so many allies. They can recruit much more soldiers than us. Now they are using this advantage to increase their attack on us. Even if we gather all the soldiers, there are less than 20,000 people. Even if we defeat the enemies outside the city, it will not change our situation of being at a disadvantage!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although we don't know how the war between Dionia and Carthage is going, it is obvious that Carthage does not have the advantage, otherwise the Dionia would not be able to invest so many troops on us. We originally wanted to rely on Carthage. It seems that the hopes of the Taiji people have been dashed now. What should we do? ..." Badani wanted to say "just make a truce with Dionia" several times, but in the end he held back. He didn't want to be scolded by the stubborn old man again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course the other three people could hear the meaning of his words, but even Kontruk remained silent. There was silence in the room, and the four of them were thinking about their own thoughts.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the evening, Segovani, who was anxious about the current war situation, once again received a request for help from Lola's messenger: The Dionia-Campania coalition forces were in a hurry to attack the city. They built a mountain of earth higher than the city wall, and also made There are many siege equipment that have never been seen before, which poses a great threat to the defense of the city wall. If reinforcements cannot be obtained immediately, Lola is in danger of being breached!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Segovani finally couldn't sit still. He immediately went to find Lesguk and asked to bring troops back to Lola immediately.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course Lesguk didn't want Segovani to lead his troops away, because Kautini was already the strongest among the four major tribes. If they left, the entire coalition's strength would probably be reduced by half.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So, Lesguk quickly advised: "The main force of Dionia is here. There will not be too many enemies attacking Lola. You only need to send one or two thousand people for reinforcements, and you can completely defend Lola. We The most important thing now is to defeat the enemies outside the city!——"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Defeat? How to defeat?!" Segovani interrupted him coldly: "Just use your cowardly method?! Our soldiers have been guarding the mountains for two days and haven't seen a single one. The beasts of burden that transport the baggage! Even if we really intercept the baggage of Dionia one day, I am afraid that our Cavutini towns on the Campania plain will be lost!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Lesguk ignored Segovani's ridicule and simply persuaded: "If you really want to go back in a hurry, why not do this? We, the big leaders, will discuss it carefully and attack Dionia within two days." Launch a fierce attack on the camp, defeat them first, and then return to help Lola together——"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Enough! Lesguk, do you think I am a fool like Kontruk and Badani, who can be fooled by you at will!" Segovani glared at him and cursed loudly: " In the past two days, we have sent soldiers to attack the enemy's camp many times, and many soldiers have been killed or injured. I believe you should be very aware of how difficult it is to attack the enemy's camp! Now, you want us to attack it by force. You want my Are all the people dead?!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lesguk, you are a person who only knows how to play tricks, only talks, but hesitates in doing things, lacks decisiveness and ruthlessness. More than ten years have passed, and you have not been able to kill Gairni or pacify Abene. Lum, on the contrary, they have become a serious problem for us! We launched a war against Dionia, and most of the actions we implemented came from your suggestions. So far, we have lost more than half of our warriors, but we have not yet won a victory!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Two days ago, the Dionian camp was far less troublesome than it is now. If you follow my suggestion and launch a fierce attack, you will definitely gain greater gains. However, you dissuaded me, and now the Dionians have completely After repairing the camp, you let us attack... Lesguk, I have seen through you. You are not worthy to be the leader of Shirpini, nor to be the commander leading the war. You are just a man who has been in the army for more than ten years. He was just a poor guy who was defeated by the Dionians before and has always been afraid of them! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Having been exposed by Segovani, Lesguk was ashamed and annoyed, and a surge of anger rushed into his brain. He suddenly rushed over, holding Segovani's hand with one hand, and pinched Segovani's neck with the other. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Segovani struggled hard but couldn't get free. His face suddenly changed and he shouted: "Les... Guk, what... do you want to do?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What do you think I'm going to do?!" Lesguk approached him with a ferocious look on his face: "You said I'm not worthy of being the leader, are you worthy?! Look at your thin body, you're worthy of being called the heroic Samo Nai warrior?! No wonder the chief of Kautini and the people have always focused on Quinduke as the chief! If you hadn't secretly made trouble and slandered his reputation, how could you have become the chief! And you should What did he do after he became the big boss?! He tore up the alliance with the Dionysians, invaded the Campania Alliance many times, and triggered a war with Dionysia. Not only did he suffer a disastrous defeat, he even became a prisoner himself!… …
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I said I am not worthy of being the chief, but are you worthy? Said that I am not suitable to lead troops in combat. Without me, you bastard would still be imprisoned by the Dionians. Not only are you not grateful, but you also insult your benefactor. Do we Samnites have a tradition of repaying kindness? Did you throw it away? You said there was nothing I could do against Gairni. Could it be that you took the credit for getting rid of Quinduk? That’s not my suggestion, it’s the cooperation of several big leaders, otherwise it’s up to you, your stupid head, to think of any way to deal with him! ——”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What are you two doing!" Kontruk, who came after hearing the news, walked into the room, saw the two entangled together, and shouted loudly: "As the leader of the tribe, you don't think carefully about how to defeat us. The enemy is in the mood to fight and scold here, aren't you afraid that the people will see the joke!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lesguk took the opportunity to loosen his hands and took a few steps back. His face was immediately full of apology, and he explained loudly: "We just had a dispute about some things. I was too impulsive. I apologize to you, Segovani. hope you can forgive me!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Segovani rubbed his pinched neck with his hands, and stared at Lesguk with a cold gaze: "Forgive?! Unless you die!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   With these words, he turned around and walked out.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Kontruk frowned and said dissatisfied: "Segovani, some small disputes should not affect our unity, otherwise -"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Shut up, old guy!" Segovani interrupted Kontruk's preaching unceremoniously: "The three of you can unite on your own. I'm leaving. I will lead my tribal warriors to leave tomorrow morning. I want to see how long Beneventum can last!" He strode out of the room.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “What on earth...what happened?!” Kontruk was rarely insulted in person, and his old face turned red.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lesguk also looked ugly, but he did not answer.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But Badani, who had just arrived outside the door, heard the conversation between the three and quietly turned around and left.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   That night, Segovani refused to see anyone, and kept his word. Regardless of the repeated dissuasion of the two chiefs Lesguk and Kontruk, he led Kautini's 8,000 warriors early the next morning. Depart from the city of Beneventum.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just as the two chiefs looked at the empty Kautini camp in the city, complaining that Segovani was narrow-minded and disregarded the overall situation, bad news came again in the city: Chief Badani had gathered more than 4,000 people The Pentney warriors were to leave the city through the north gate and return to their territory.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lesguk was shocked: the Cavutini army had already left, and if the Pentenid army left again, the Samnite tribal coalition would be disintegrated, and there would be less than 7,000 warriors left in the city. Facing 2 people outside the city, With ten thousand enemies, you are completely at a disadvantage!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So he hurried to the north of the city again, trying to dissuade Badani.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Kontruk originally followed closely, but soon he slowed down because he suddenly felt that it might be a good thing for Badani to lead his team away, as long as he blocked the invasion of the enemy from the east and defended Pentney's territory. , Karacheni, north of Pentney, is naturally safe.
