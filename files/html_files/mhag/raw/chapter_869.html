   Chapter 869 Carthage welcomes Mago
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Father, is it because the war situation in the south has changed?” Patroclus asked hurriedly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos was satisfied with his keen war instincts. An excellent senior team officer should be like this. His vision should not only focus on one battle, but should overlook the overall situation. He looked at the other two people again, and he, Adoris and Crotokatax, also cast concerned glances. They had been fighting in Latium and had almost no access to outside information. Davos felt that there was It is necessary to let them know the situation on other battlefields.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Since Alexis defeated the Samnite coalition twice at Asculum and Venosa, the Samnite people no longer attacked the kingdom’s territory, but instead aggressively attacked the Campanian League and captured Pangolin. Bay, Herculaneum, Tessala and other city-states, and finally besieged Naples——"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Isn’t the Campania League in danger of collapse? Have we sent troops to rescue?” Clotokatax asked in surprise.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos smiled and said: "Before attacking the Campania Alliance, another thing happened. The leader of Cavutini trapped and killed the leader of Naconia, Quinduk, who had always remained neutral, and captured Naco. In the territory of Dionia, his actions obviously stimulated Gharni of Abenirum. Not only did he decide to make Abenirum a free city of Dionia, but he would also assist us in attacking Samnite. Tribal alliance. Therefore, the Ministry of Military Affairs formulated a new combat plan, allowing Alexis to lead the army to attack the Samnite Mountains from the east——"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Father, I remember that you repeatedly reminded the Ministry of Military Affairs not to allow the army to attack the Samnite Mountains!" Clotokatax exclaimed. He was a little worried about Hilos and Felicius from the Ministry of Military Affairs. Adults who make arbitrary decisions will be scolded by their father.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, I have made such an order before." Davos looked calm and said: "But now the situation has changed. The Ministry of Military Affairs secretly ordered Potentia to summon soldiers and quietly communicate with Abenirum. They were familiar with the Samnite Mountains and were good at mountain warfare. The Samnite originally wanted to lure us into attacking the mountains, but instead we set up an ambush in Aquilonia and completely defeated their troops hidden in the mountains. A main force!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now, Alexis leads a coalition of nearly 20,000 people to attack Beneventum directly. The Samnite coalition that besieged Naples must withdraw its siege and retreat. In this way, we have the initiative to fight the Samnite people, whether it is confronting the Samnite army at Beneventum, or joining forces with the Campanian allies to attack the Samnite army on the eastern plain. The town of Nai, or our remaining troops in the Dauni area can take advantage of the great opportunity of the enemy's main force being contained to continue attacking other towns in the Samnai Mountains..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "So, the war with the Samnites no longer requires our help." Adoris' tone was a bit disappointed, and he immediately asked: "Father, what is the situation in Sicily?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos's face turned pale and he said slowly: "Since Plesius defeated the Carthaginian army in Minoa, our Sicilian fleet and the Carthaginian fleet soon had a battle on the sea near Selinus. The result of the war... a huge storm at sea destroyed almost all the warships of both the enemy and ours. Flarios drowned, there is still no news from Cyklian, and more than 10,000 sailors died——"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What?!" The three people showed shocked expressions. They never expected that while they were still fighting bloody battles in the north, such tragic losses would occur in the southern seas!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos continued: "The Fourth Fleet has been transferred to Sicily, and we still have the advantage at sea. Alexis led the team to capture Selinus, and the remaining Carthaginian forces held on to several important positions. The towns did not dare to attack, so Alexis sent troops to plunder and destroy the Carthaginian ruled areas in Sicily in order to achieve the purpose of active defense.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the disastrous defeat of the Carthaginian army caused Mago, the Iberian governor of Carthage, to become the new commander-in-chief of the Carthaginian army. Now the entire African coast and Iberia are gathering soldiers and forming armies to prepare for landing in Sicily. A new war is about to begin! We must get rid of the Romans and Samnites as soon as possible, and rush south to fight our biggest enemy Carthage to the death! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos’s words not only made the three young people feel the urgency of the situation, but also made them feel excited.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the day when Davos held a grand banquet, held games, and rewarded soldiers in the city of Rome, he welcomed a huge fleet of Iberian troops at the port of Utica.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Utica, a Phoenician city-state second only to Carthage in town size on the African continent, is located on the seaside about 110 miles west of Carthage.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mago's ship docked first, and he walked onto the pier dressed in military uniform. The senators headed by Preeta Kuba immediately came forward and said, "Master Mago, welcome back!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mago gave Pretakuba a warm hug and said emotionally: "Thank you for your hard work, Pretakuba! It's all thanks to you during my absence in the past few years! Thanks to you!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Preeta Kuba patted his thick shoulder and said excitedly: "It will be good if you come back. Once you come back, we will have hope!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then Mago greeted the other Magonid elders warmly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Master Mago, welcome! You have finally led your army!” An old man with white beard and hair came forward to greet him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Dear Lord Ace Yaruba!" Facing the leader of the Neutral Faction, whose reputation in the Senate was second only to Hanno's, Mago still bowed to Ace Yaruba and said with a solemn expression: "Carthage It is in danger, and as a descendant of the founder of this city, how can I just sit back and let it go?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I'm glad you can think this way and do this. This is exactly what all Carthage citizens expect of you!" Aisyaruba said seriously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Everyone?!" Mago sneered, pointed at the senators who came to greet him, and said, "Isn't this wrong? At least some people who haven't come here don't think so."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "These senators who did not come have gathered more than 60,000 soldiers for you, and are still raising a huge amount of food and grass for you to supply this army, and are still urging the shipyards and other allies to speed up the construction of warships... So don't They are excessively suspicious of their compatriots, and they are also making their own efforts for the future of Carthage!" Esiyaruba said with a serious heart.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This made Mago hesitate to speak. He thought for a while and his tone became gentler: "Unlike the natives of Syracuse, Numbia, and Iberia, the Dionians are our real people." This is a powerful enemy that requires all our efforts to defeat it! Therefore, I will try my best to maintain the unity of Carthage, and I also hope that Lord Aceyaroba can play a greater role in this regard!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Don't worry, the previous disastrous defeat has taught us a lesson. Hanno, me, and other senators all hope that you can win, because if you fail, it will mean disaster for Carthage! We will do our best to support you , until the Dionians are driven out of Sicily and force their king to choose humiliating peace talks!" Ace Yaroba promised.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mago expressed his gratitude for this, and then he turned to look at the port, waiting for his generals to assemble the soldiers who came ashore and lead them out of the city of Utica.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Among the more than 20,000 soldiers led by Mago, there were not many Carthaginians and Phoenicians. They had the same composition as the army led by Hasdrubal before. Most of them were mercenaries. They were closely related to the Carthaginians, The different looks and different costumes of the Phoenicians not only attracted curious onlookers from the Utica people, but also made comments about it from the senators who came to greet them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, several more boats docked, and what got off the boats were a group of strong, bare-chested men wearing striped plaid trousers. They were all tall and unusually tall, with strong muscles, thick hair, and weird tattoos embroidered on their bodies. With his short unkempt hair, unkempt beard, and ferocious face, the people at the port screamed in surprise as soon as he landed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This made them seem to be stimulated. They slapped the long shield in their right hand with the long sword in their left hand, and roared "woo woo" in their mouths. Their appearance became even more ferocious, which actually scared most of the Uticans who were watching. Turning around and running away, the scene was a little chaotic for a while. Fortunately, their leader stopped them in time, but this did not guarantee that they could line up peacefully at the port.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “A group of terrifying barbarians! Are they also from Iberia?” Esiyaruba also asked in surprise.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The Celts in the mountains of northern Iberia were not afraid of death when fighting, and other indigenous people in Iberia were afraid of them. It happened to be during this time that a flash flood occurred in their area, and all their livestock and food were washed away. Go, facing famine, I exchanged thousands of cattle and sheep for their help. I believe that with them, our war against Dionia will be smoother!" Mago said confidently.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I hope so. However, this is also the reason why the Senate did not allow your army to land at the port of Carthage. I hope you can manage your army well and not cause any trouble here and let the people treat you It will create a bad impression." Ace Yaroba reminded solemnly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mago once again expressed his gratitude to Esiyaruba for his kind reminder.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After all the soldiers came ashore, Mago's men gathered them, took them away from the city of Utica, and began to camp outside the city, while Mago followed the senators to Carthage.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the past ten years, although Mago has been living in southern Iberia for a long time, he has returned to the city of Carthage many times, but he never expected to encounter a situation like today: almost the entire city's people ran out , crowded on both sides of the road. As soon as he entered the city, thunderous cheers rang out from all around. The people shouted his name and threw petals at him...

   Thanks to Sniper No. 11 for the reward! Your support is my motivation to write! !
