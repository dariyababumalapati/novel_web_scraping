   Chapter 892 A strange fleet
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Miltias left, Leotizides immediately said: "Tagru, hurry up and inform the rescue troops to rush to the port immediately."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Commander." Tagru received the order and did not immediately execute it. Instead, he asked with some confusion: "Are the Carthaginians taking too many risks? They sent tens of thousands of troops to cross the traffic. Inconvenient and inconvenient mountainous areas for food transportation, separated by Selinus and Minoa, they want to capture Agrigento. Once our reinforcements arrive and their attempts fail, these tens of thousands of Carthaginians may even There is no need for us to attack, and we will be defeated because the food cannot be supplied in time..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, this Carthaginian commander Mago really dares to take risks. It seems that he believes in the ability of his army." Leotizides looked at the wooden map hanging on the wall, his eyes flashing: "So we The reinforcements must be fast."

   …………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the Dionian army occupied Selinus, half of its port was quickly converted into a simple military port, which not only allowed the warships of the Sicilian fleet to dock for supplies, but also could be pushed ashore for maintenance and repairs... making the fleet Having a stable and secure foothold in western Sicily provides convenience for patrolling and attacking the western sea.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now, more than 150 warships of the Sicilian fleet are docked at the dock. Soldiers from friendly city-states on the south coast such as Minoa, Agrigento, Gela, Camanlina, and Ecnome, as well as 1,000 Dionia reserve legion soldiers, a total of 6,000 soldiers, are boarding the warships in batches.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to be able to transport this support force to the port of Agrigento at once, Miltias did not even let the fleet soldiers board the crow warship, just to free up more space on the warship.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seklian objected to this. He believed that the entire fleet could not be used to transport soldiers, and at least half of the warships needed to be used as escorts. This is a vigilance that a naval commander must have.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Miltias retorted: Only half of the warships were freed, which meant that half of the soldiers had to be transported for the second time. Now the enemy's situation was urgent. If Agrigento was breached due to lack of troops, this responsibility would not be fulfilled. Who will bear the responsibility? Moreover, after completing the transportation of troops, the Sicilian fleet had to cruise west, so there was no room for delay.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two sides parted on bad terms again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seklian simply boarded the earliest clipper to leave the port, out of sight and out of mind.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to save time, each warship must be loaded with soldiers and set off immediately. Therefore, when Miltias boarded the last flagship and left the port, the entire fleet spread as much as four or five miles eastward, forming a curve. A single, curved line, each ship was packed with soldiers and therefore sailed slowly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Miltias was also a little anxious about this. He looked at the soldiers lying on the deck with a frown, and estimated the time it would take to get from Selinus to Agrigento at this speed. By the time the transportation was completed, it would probably be already in the afternoon. , it is simply impossible for the fleet to patrol anymore.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, he hoped that there would be a relatively strong northwest wind like the day the Carthaginian army landed, which would greatly shorten the sailing time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And just as he was thinking about it, the lookout suddenly shouted from above his head: "Attention! Attention! There is an enemy situation in the southeast!!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Miltias was shocked, and then he became confused: all the Carthaginian warships were destroyed, where was the enemy on the southeast sea?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While he was confused, the lookout on the mast shouted anxiously again: "Two blue flags have been raised on the clipper! Two blue flags!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The blue flag means that what appears is not a Carthaginian warship, otherwise the clipper will raise the yellow flag immediately, but the two blue flags mean that what appears nearby is a fleet, and the number is equivalent to the Sicilian fleet, regardless of whether it is There was hostility, all posing a considerable threat to the Sicilian fleet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Miltias felt panicked. He held the side of the ship and tried hard to look to the southeast, but he could only vaguely see a few small dots on the sea in the distance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Among the four major fleet commanders, neither Miltias nor Flarios had any experience in independently commanding large-scale naval battles. During the South Italian War, Miltias was only the captain of a trireme. After the establishment of the 4th Fleet, the Ministry of Military Affairs provided Davos with multiple candidates for fleet leadership. Their qualifications and achievements , and have similar abilities, Davos couldn't make a choice for a while. In the end, he chose Miltias because Miltias had served as the captain of Davos's ship. Davos still had some impressions of him, which gave him extra points.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After becoming the commander of the Fourth Fleet, Miltias spent most of his time leading the fleet to patrol the Adriatic Sea, combating pirates, and helping the army transport supplies. The only so-called naval battle was the conquest of Messape and Pudu in Dionia. When Chetty attacked the Mapu United Fleet, because the opponent was too weak, it was defeated with almost no effort.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now when Miltias may encounter the first great sea battle, the situation is so complicated: it is still unclear whether the opponent is an enemy or a friend, making it impossible for him to make a sudden decision to fight; not only does his own fleet have no formation, , and each warship was full of soldiers, which slowed down the speed and weakened the combat capability; but at this time, the entire fleet was located on the sea near Germe, so it was difficult to retreat. As a small town, The small and crude port of Germe could not accommodate the Sicilian fleet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Under such circumstances, he was inevitably a little panicked. He tried his best to calm down, and then issued the first order: "Raise the flag of Apollo and sound the bugle!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   With the sound of the bugle, the golden flag was raised to the top of the mast and fluttered in the wind.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The warships in front of the flagship heard the sound of the bugle and saw the flying flag, and they all turned their bows and moved closer to Miltias' ship.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The semaphore of the Apollo flag is: center on the flagship and move closer to it, shortening the distance between warships to facilitate command and defense.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Miltias's thought at this time was: The fleet is now full of soldiers, which is not conducive to combat, and his flagship is located closer to Selinus. When all the warships approach him, if this strange fleet really If he launches an attack, he can lead the fleet back to Selinus first.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Dionysian fleet extends too far on the sea, especially the warships at the front. The observer can neither see the flag on the rearmost flagship nor the signal from the speedboat cruising behind. , they could only make corresponding changes after seeing the warships behind them make tactical maneuvers, and the transmission of this message seemed a bit slow at this critical moment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because the clipper ship Sekerian was on was the first to leave, it was already a little far away from the entire fleet. Since he sat sullenly on the bow after boarding the ship, the crew could see that he was in a bad mood, and no one dared to come forward to disturb him. , the whole ship was unusually quiet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, he suddenly became calm, touched his ears, and asked the captain who was watching the sea conditions: "Did you hear it? There seems to be a bugle sound."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The captain shook his head blankly, listened carefully for a while, and then answered truthfully: "Sir, I didn't hear it."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The captain's words did not reassure Sekerian. He stood up, looked behind him, then raised his head and asked, "What happened to the warship behind?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a while, the lookout at the masthead replied: "They haven't changed much."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Sir, maybe you heard wrong.” The captain said.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seclian seemed not to have heard of it, and there was an uneasiness in his heart. Perhaps this uneasiness was buried when he learned that Miltias had the entire fleet full of soldiers without escorting warships, but now this kind of uneasiness The feeling became stronger.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He no longer hesitated and said decisively: "Turn around and drive back to take a look."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The captain complained a little in his heart that he was suspicious, but he did not dare to object in person. After all, Sekerian was a former naval commander, a victorious general and a hero worshiped by the crew, and his prestige was too high.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just as the Dionian warships turned around and returned one after another, the fleet was also approaching the Sicilian fleet. Many small black spots had appeared in Miltias's field of vision, which made him feel frightened.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, he heard the lookout at the top of the mast exclaim: "Two yellow flags! Two yellow flags are raised! It's the enemy! It's the enemy!!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The last luck in Miltias's heart was shattered. Now that the other warships have not yet completely approached, it is too late to retreat back to Selinus. Fortunately, while waiting, he already had a prepared plan: "Let's go again." Sound the bugle and let the warships dock at the nearest beach, put down the soldiers, and then return to fight!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, the following words cannot be expressed in semaphores, so his flagship must take the lead to set an example and let other warships follow suit. Therefore, after giving the order, the flagship sailed straight towards the coast.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Dionia Clipper, which was cruising on the southeast side of the fleet to explore, actually did not know the approaching fleet. However, as the opponent's warships continued to approach, the formation slowly unfolded, the sails lowered, and the oars began to slide faster, this But the standard preparation process before a fleet enters battle is of course the enemy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It turns out that this fleet did not come from Carthage, but from the Phoenician region in the Eastern Mediterranean. Since the storm destroyed Carthage's navy, the Carthaginians have completely lost their maritime superiority. The Dionysian Sicilian fleet is rampant on the sea, not only trying to cut off the connection between Carthage and Sicily, but also beginning to threaten Carthage's base. The city's maritime trade. At this critical moment of life and death, while Carthage was stepping up its efforts to build new warships, it also thought of its mother state.
