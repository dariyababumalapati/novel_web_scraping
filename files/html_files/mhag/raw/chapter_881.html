   Chapter 881 The ending of the Samnite coalition (3)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, the number of troops led by Zantiparis was reduced to 7,000, but this was also three and a half times the number of soldiers led by Segovani.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For two days in a row, the Cavutini soldiers repelled the enemy's attack, but they also suffered a lot of casualties. The city of Abela was even more dilapidated. Segovani had already begun to think about retreating, and then received another attack. After hearing the bad news of "the fall of Beneventum", he abandoned the people of Abela and Thessala in the city that night and led his army to quietly withdraw to Cavutim.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The next day, the people in the city discovered that they had been abandoned by Segovani. The few remaining Abela and Cesaras soldiers decided to surrender to the coalition forces outside the city, but they were filled with hatred and suffered heavy losses. Of course, the Nian warriors were firmly opposed, and Zantiparis refused. Because following the instructions of Daves, Abella, as a small city in the eastern plain of Campania connecting Cautim and Beneventum, is too important and must be completely controlled by the Kingdom of Dionia. In order to avoid future management troubles, Zantiparis felt that it was better to occupy it directly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Dionysian coalition launched an attack, and in an instant they entered the city and occupied Abela.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Naconian warriors led the captured Cavutini warriors to the corpses of the original Naconian leaders and sacrificed their blood.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the east, Alexis only rested for a day in Beneventom and briefly handled some affairs in the city, that is, he asked Pollet to allocate half of his troops to garrison the city, and he personally led the other troops to march towards the city. March west, pass through the mountain road, and arrive at Kautim.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Xantiparis captured Abella, he led his troops to march eastward without stopping, and successfully joined forces with Alexis's troops at Cavutim, with a force of nearly 30,000 people.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The garrison of Cavutim was less than 2,000 people, which caused great panic among the tribes in the city. Some leaders united and suggested to Segovani whether they could surrender to the Dionian coalition to protect the people in the city.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Segovani refused without even thinking about it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The unwilling leaders eagerly argued with him, but unexpectedly this angered Segovani, who had become increasingly surly due to successive defeats. He arrested the leader, expelled the others, and threatened to fight with Dioni. The Asian Alliance Army fought bloody battle to the end.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This crazy move made some tribes alienate, and there were many people who went out of the city to communicate with the Dionian coalition that night.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   How could Alexis miss such a good opportunity and immediately launch an attack on the city the next day.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Cavutim soon fell, and Segovani also died on the city wall. So far, the two most powerful tribes in the Samnite tribe alliance, the Shilpini, were completely conquered, and the Cavutini were mostly conquered. , the remaining Kautini towns in the north such as Capua and Calatia were unable to support themselves, and it was only a matter of time before they were conquered.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just as the Dionian coalition forces met in Kautim, Kontruk and Badani gathered the maximum strength that the two tribes could muster-5,000 warriors, trying to attack the Dionian army in the east. Conduct raids.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But Cappus, who was cautious in using troops, did not continue to go deep into the mountainous area after occupying Eequium. Instead, while stabilizing the local order, he continued to send out reconnaissance teams to conduct detailed exploration of the surrounding terrain.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a result, the movement of the Samnite army was detected, and he immediately made preparations for defense.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The raid by the two Samnite tribes eventually turned into a frontal assault, and they had to retreat after suffering some casualties.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Subsequently, news of the "falls of Beneventum and Kautim" came one after another. Kontruk and Badani were shocked and had to lead their own armies and retreat to their tribal territories to prepare for the coming Dai. Attack of the Onian Allied Forces.

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, good news! Xantiparis led the army not only captured Lola, but also defeated the main force of Cavutini who came to rescue!..." Tormid hurried into the big tent, excited said loudly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Oh!" Davos hurriedly took the battle report. After reading it carefully, he suddenly smiled and said: "This is indeed good news! The disastrous defeat of Cavoutini, the surrender of the Naconians, and the victory of the war in Samone has been decided. ! Zantiparis has made great achievements! Is this his first time leading an army independently?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Your Majesty. Zantiparis was about to retire from the army. The Ministry of Military Affairs temporarily recruited him to Lucania to form a reserve army. Because the Samnite War broke out, he led the team to participate in the Battle of Campania. War..." Tormid spoke in such detail out of selfishness. He has a very good relationship with Xantiparis. They both came to Magna Graecia together back then, so he hopes that Xantiparis, who is over 60 years old, will be in the kingdom. There can still be a good development.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course Davos knew that Tormid and Zantiparis were better, but he didn't care about the little thoughts he was hiding. Instead, he took pictures of the battle report and said with half sigh and half regret: "Whether it's capturing Lola, Even when he defeated the main force of Cavutini, Zantiparis showed excellent military commanding abilities! He should not have been allowed to be the prosecutor of the Ministry of Military Affairs in the first place. He wasted all these years! My understanding of them is still Not enough!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thormid was so interested that he didn't say anything, but he was happy for his friend in his heart.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos sighed for a while, and then praised loudly: "The strategic plan for Samona designated by your Ministry of Military Affairs this time is also very good! Alexis in the east, Zantiparis and Campa in the west The three armies of the Nian Allied Forces, Abernirum and Potentia in the center cooperated closely and attacked in turn. After defeating the Samnite people, Gu Dong couldn't care about the west, and Gu Xi couldn't care about the center. Failure was doomed. Understand!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Your Majesty." Clerk Henepolis also said with a smile: "As you once said, although the Samnites are hungry wolves, our Dionia is a lion. Even if the wolf bites the male lion a few times, it won't cause much harm, but as long as the male lion gives a claw to the hungry wolf, half of its life will be gone."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "We have to be more greedy. This evil wolf will take his whole life." Davos made a joke, and then said: "Henny, go take out the map of the Samonai region and put it on it. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hernepolis responded. Then he went to search the bookshelves filled with various documents and materials, and Crotokatax also came to help him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Tormid." Davos continued: "As for the letter from the Ministry of Military Affairs saying that 'the number of troops participating in the Samnite War has increased, resulting in a shortage of military food supply,' I have thought about it. In the future, Alexis and Zanti We will provide food for the army led by Paris."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, you mean... to transport military rations from Rome to Campania?" Tormid asked this just out of politeness. In fact, he was not surprised, because the food hoarded in Rome was indeed very sufficient. Not only did the army capture rations from Rome, as well as food plundered from almost all the residences of Roman nobles, but there was also food and grass collected from captured Latin and Etruscan city-states. Mu's Dionian army and the people in Rome were used for half a year.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You lead the young people on the staff to formulate a more detailed food supply plan based on the army situation in Campania and the food and transportation situation in Rome, and then submit it to me for review, and then send it to Asistes , let him be responsible for the arrangements." Davos ordered.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Yes, Your Majesty.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos touched his chin, pondered for a while, and then said: "It seems that we should also send people to ask for military rations from the Etruscan allies and the Latin allies..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Father, aren't Rome's grain reserves still sufficient? And the harvest will be harvested again in two months. Most of the farmland outside the cities of Rome, Viai, and Gabi has not been damaged. Now it is receiving great support from the Roman people. With good care, I believe that enough food will be harvested by then, which can not only be supplied to the armies of Latium and Campania, but also to the army of Sicily. There is no need to ask for food from the newly joined allies, so To deepen their dissatisfaction with us." Crotokatax advised with some worry.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos looked at him with a smile: "I'm glad that you were not idle in Rome and had a more detailed understanding of the area we occupied. That's how it should be! However, the reason why I want to send people to ask for food from these allies is It’s not because we are short of food, but to solve their confusion.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Resolve their confusion?!” Crotokatax himself was confused.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos smiled and patiently explained to him: "In the past, Rome fought every year and often asked these allies for food and soldiers, and they were used to it. But now these city-states have taken refuge in our Dionia, and We have been fighting alone and have never asked for any help from them. I am afraid that they will be confused and even worry about whether we will turn against them again after destroying Rome."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crotocatax suddenly realized: "So asking for food from them is just to show them that Dionia does regard them as allies."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos continued: "This is just a purpose. In addition, I will ask the envoys to request food from them without making rigid regulations on the quantity. In this way, the amount of food provided by each ally can be just enough for the food. We make a rough judgment on how sincere they are towards Dionia!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotocathacus mused.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos glanced at the map that had been placed on the table and said: "Clotho, you have just heard the news that 'Zantiparis led the army to defeat the main force of Kautini in Lola', and Alek The Sith have also reached the city of Beneventum, and Capus is attacking the Shirpini Mountains from the east... The defeat of the Samnites is only a matter of time. If you are asked to deal with the conquered Samnites What will you do with the mountainous area?"
