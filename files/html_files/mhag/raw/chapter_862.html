  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lesguk, this is what you call a damned trick to lure the enemy! 5,000... 5,000 brave Samnite warriors are gone! And my best friend Usibik... Usibik !..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Segovani cursed angrily, but his eyes suddenly turned red: Usibik and he were similar in age, and the two tribes were adjacent to each other. They had played together since childhood and established a deep friendship, so on Kawutini After the death of the first chief, Usibik gave up the competition for the position of chief and fully supported him, which enabled him to defeat Quinduk and become the new chief of Cavutini; and after he was captured, It was Usibik who united with other leaders to withstand Quinduk's pressure to re-elect the chief leader, took the initiative to cooperate with other chief leaders of the tribe, and finally rescued him...

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Segovani was restless, irritable, and vengeful. He was difficult to get close to and had few friends. He only had a deep friendship with Usibik for decades. When he heard the news of his death, he immediately lost control of his emotions.

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lesguk, don't blame Segovani for scolding you. You have been at odds with Gairni for more than ten years, but you didn't pay attention to him and didn't detect the signs of Abenirum's rebellion in time. Regarding this failure, You really have to bear a big responsibility!" Badani, the leader of Pentney, also criticized him. He thought that he was worried about starting a war with Dionia, but he was persuaded by Lesguk, and the war has ended until now. , the coalition forces were defeated one after another, and the Pentney people suffered heavy losses. His dissatisfaction with Lesguk was also increasing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Well, since things have happened, what's the use of blaming each other now! That damn traitor once solemnly swore in front of the high priest, but still betrayed our entire Samnite Alliance. This is the first time in the history of our race Once again, who could have imagined it! Although the plan to lure the enemy was proposed by Lesguk, it was decided upon by our joint discussion. At that time, no one warned us to be careful of Abenirum and Potenti. Asians, we have ignored them..." Kontruk, the leader of Karacheni, lamented. As the oldest of the four leaders, although he has a hot temper, at this moment he knows that guarantees are more needed in times of crisis. The unity of the entire tribal alliance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Now that the Dionian coalition has entered the mountainous area, and it is a huge army, our homeland is being seriously threatened. Next, we must take immediate action to prevent the enemy from further intrusion and protect our territory and People!" Kontruk reminded extremely solemnly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "In this case, we have to stop the siege of Naples, which is a pity." Although Badani, the leader of Pentney, said this, there was no look of regret on his face. In these days, the Samnite coalition forces have ravaged Most of the city-states in the Campalia League had no way to deal with Naples, which had a high city wall and thick walls. They attacked several times and lost some soldiers, but there was no hope of breaking through the city wall defenses.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The siege capabilities of the Samnite tribal coalition were lackluster. If it weren't for the earlier plan to lure the enemy, the army would have withdrawn. Now that the plan to lure the enemy has been shattered, the other three people have no objections to this.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "But where are we going to withdraw our troops to meet the enemy? You know, a day ago, the Dionians were still near Aquilonia, and now there is no updated news about them. This is a short distance from Aquilonia It's only 200 miles away. When we lead the army to Aquilonia, I don't know where the Dionians will go." Badani raised an important question.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Lesguk, what suggestions do you have?” Kontruk asked. After all, the Dionysian coalition was operating in the territory of Shirpini, and Lesguk should be more familiar with the situation there.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When he heard the news that "the troops staying in the mountains were defeated," Lesguk was first shocked, then ashamed, and then fearful... Therefore, when Segovani and Badani accused him, he also While thinking hard about how to deal with this crisis, although he was a little angry in his heart, he did not show it. As Kontruk said, he needed the entire tribal alliance to work together to drive away Dai who was raging in Shirpini territory. Onian Allied Forces, he glanced at Segovani who was still grieving, and thought in his heart: I did not find anything unusual about Abenirum, but you occupied the area that is more closely connected with Abenirum. Naconia, which has many close followers in its territory, also did not notice any changes in the Abenirum army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, he won’t say these words
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "We should retreat the army to Beneventum! It's not that I have any selfish intentions, but because Abenirum, which is very close to Beneventum, has betrayed Samnai. In this way, Dio The coalition organized by the Nians can successfully pass through Abenirum and attack Beneventum! Once they occupy Beneventum, Cavutim will also be under great threat——"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Having said this, Lesguk looked at Segovani. He firmly believed that even though the great leader of Cavutini mourned the death of his close friend in battle, he should understand that the loss of Beneventum would have a negative impact on Cavudim. What a threat. After all, the two towns are adjacent to each other, only more than ten miles apart, and Cavutini is located on a small plain among the mountains. The terrain is not dangerous, so he believes that Segovani will eventually support him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What if the Dionians do not attack Beneventom, but continue to attack north after capturing Aquilonia?" Badani immediately raised his concerns because he was worried about heavy troops The defense of Bereventum left the eastern part of the mountainous area empty of defense. If the Dionysian army went all the way north, it would threaten the territories of Pentney and Karacheni.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hence, Kontruk also expressed concern.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lesguk shook his head and said: "The Dionian coalition will not do that, because our army is not only stationed in Beneventum, but can also attack Abenirum. Occupying Abenirum not only protects Ka The security of the Utini territory can continue to threaten Potentia through it, and I am afraid this is what the Dionians are worried about."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lesguk is right, I agree with the retreat to Beneventum!" Segovani expressed his support loudly, completely losing the sadness and anger of scolding Lesguk before.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The leaders of the two most powerful tribes in the alliance have reached an agreement. In fact, Kontruk and Badani have no more choices, not to mention they also think that Lesguk is right.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While the four were discussing the retreat, Badani couldn't help but said: "In fact, we... can consider a truce with Dionia..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The three of them were shocked after hearing this: Since the war with Dionia, the Samoni tribe alliance has suffered successive defeats and suffered heavy losses. Many tribal leaders have complained, and even their own confidence in the war is wavering.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, Lesguk was the first to object: "We tore up the alliance, declared war on Dionia, invaded the Dauni region, and plundered the Campania Alliance. These are all serious violations of Dionia. It is a taboo of people that the tough King of Dionia can never negotiate peace with us. He wants to completely eliminate us who continue to cause him trouble, so we can only continue to fight until there is a turning point."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lesguk understands: If the Samnite Alliance really surrenders to Dionia, he will be the first victim, because Gairni, who has surrendered to Dionia, will never spare him, so his attitude Very determined.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "A turning point? What turning point?" Badani asked with a slightly gloomy look.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Defeat the Dionia in the next battle! Or wait for Dionia to be defeated on other battlefields!" Segovani took over, and he also knew clearly in his heart: If the Samonite Alliance really wants to fight Dionia, If the war in Nia ceases, he will never get good results, because he is the perpetrator who provoked this war, and he also trapped and killed Quinduk, who was supported by Dionia, and killed and arrested so many people. The Naconian people who believe in Hades.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But he would not say this out, but found a more sufficient reason: "Badani, don't be stupid! Think about the last Tarantum who tore up the covenant and fought against Dionia! Nan! After the Italian War, they surrendered to Dionia and became that kind of free city. As a result, their territory was greatly divided and they could not have their own army. The citizens of the entire city-state were raised like cattle and sheep. Don't you think so? Do you hope that our Samonite Alliance will become the second Tarantum?! Even if we want peace talks, we have to create more trouble for Dionia and force him to take the initiative to negotiate, so that we can gain more during the negotiations. On an equal footing, we can make a peace treaty that is more beneficial to us!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Peace talks?! Huh, we are the descendants of Savoni and we must not succumb to any force! As long as the independence of the alliance cannot be guaranteed, we will fight to the end, even to death!" Kontruk is the oldest but has the strongest fighting spirit. , and shouted to Badani in the tone of an elder: "Take out your courage, your father's soul wandering in the Savonni Temple is still waiting for you to wash away his shame!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Faced with the strong opposition of the three leaders, Badani laughed and said: "You are right, the alliance can only fight Dionia to the end before there will be a way out..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Late at night, the messenger from Beneventum arrived at the Samnite camp, bringing the news that "a large army was stationed in the territory of Abenerum". This increased the motivation of the four chiefs to immediately withdraw their troops to Beneventum. Neventum's urgency.

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, a clipper from Enona sailed into the port of Naples in the darkness of night, guided by the light of the lighthouse.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not long after, the candles in the Naples Council Hall were lit, and senior officials from Naples, senior officials from the allied countries who had taken refuge, and reinforcements from the alliance's generals arrived one after another.
