   Chapter 890 Return of Cyklian
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The strong military strength gave Mago enough confidence that he would not care about some casualties, and his words also cheered up the generals.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mago then said to the adjutant: "Immediately send someone to notify Admika in the southern camp and ask him to organize 10,000 soldiers, and then rush to the eastern camp as our backup."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Yes, sir!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mago looked around at everyone, and then said in blunt Celtic language: "Rutam, you and your people are the vanguard."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Celtic leader Rutam, whose appearance and attire were obviously different from others, replied angrily: "Oh!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Rutam is a Lusitanian. This race that lives widely in northwest Iberia is fierce and warlike. It once brought great trouble to Mago's expansion in the Iberian Peninsula, and even threatened his expansion in Iberia. In the end, Mago had to conclude a peace agreement with them. This time he impressed several large tribes of this race with huge benefits, causing them to form an army of about 8,000 people and follow Mago to conquer Sicily. Lutam is just one of the tribal leaders. Since the melee in the dark night relies more on personal force, it is conducive to their performance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   About ten minutes later, the troops from the Chinese army camp gradually left the south gate of the camp and marched along the built earth wall toward the east camp, which was falling into chaos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When evening came, Leotizides went to the top of the east city and looked at the Carthage camp with all his concentration. He waited until there was a loud noise of killing and a commotion in the camp opposite, and then he felt temporarily relieved. tone, and then immediately ordered the 10,000 heavy infantry composed of the Eighth Army and reserve soldiers who had been waiting in the city to rush out of the city and continue to attack the enemy camp, which began to fall into chaos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, the careful Leotizides did not forget that when the enemy's attention was attracted by the night attack, he sent soldiers from the mountain reconnaissance team, climbed over the earth wall, and lurked around Carthage. He stayed in front of the camp and reported what he saw in a timely manner, allowing him to fully understand the enemy's response in detail.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, even if he learned that the raiding troops had merged and completely crushed the enemy's resistance, causing the camp to fall into complete chaos, he was not excited. On the contrary, he felt uneasy after learning that most of the Carthage camps in other areas had gathered soldiers and did not rush to rescue them. Instead, they were stationed at the borders of their respective camps.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sure enough, the raiding force wanted to drive away the defeated troops and overwhelm the neighboring camps, continuing to expand the chaos, but the progress was somewhat slow.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, another urgent news came: Carthage’s central camp had sent troops, and they were rushing east along the earth wall.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leotizides immediately realized that the Carthaginians wanted to cut off the return route of the night attack force and surround and annihilate them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Dionian soldiers participating in the night attack were the main force under Leotizides. She had been standing at the top of the city, paying attention to the progress of the battle, just to avoid such a thing from happening.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Woo! Woo! Woo!..." The trumpeters who had been standing at the top of the city immediately blew the retreat trumpet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before setting off, the assault soldiers who had received repeated instructions from their commander heard the sound of the bugle, reminded each other, and stopped chasing the defeated troops one after another...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before retreating, they did one last thing - burn the camp.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before the rescue force led by Mago arrived, the news that "the Dionians actually retreated back to the city" really surprised him. In his opinion, after the Dionians successfully attacked at night, they would definitely take advantage of the victory to pursue them. Defeating the soldiers and expanding the results of the battle gave him time to surround them, but the Dionysian's calmness and decisiveness made his plan fail, and the hurried reinforcements had to become a fire brigade.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As the vanguard, the Lusitalians chased after them unwillingly, but were attacked from a distance by the well-prepared city defenders. After suffering some casualties, they had to retreat in frustration.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In this night attack, the Dionians only suffered more than 400 casualties, but it caused nearly 4,000 casualties in the Carthaginian army, half of which were caused by the Carthaginian soldiers pushing and trampling each other as they fled in the dark. At the same time, 1/3 of the eastern military camp was burned to ashes, and the Carthaginian army suffered heavy losses.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Mago returned to the big tent, he was unable to sleep. He was brooding about this failure. The tenacity of the fighting will and the changeable tactics of the far inferior Dionians frightened him and made him realize The huge force paralyzed him, making him slow to respond to the battle situation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After learning from the painful experience, he used this as an excuse the next day to forcefully dismiss most of the Carthaginian generals, allowing senior officers who had followed him in the Iberian Peninsula for many years to take over the Carthaginian army, and began to It is reorganized and trained.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, he suspended the construction of the earth wall and stepped up the repairs of the crude camp.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, the fire last night caused the Carthaginians to lose a lot of supplies, and Mago sent a messenger to notify Imisele, the lord of Lilibi, to deliver a batch of supplies to the camp.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is no shortage of supplies in Lilibi City for the time being, but there is a shortage of manpower, so labor at the port has to be temporarily recruited.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the team transporting baggage was about to arrive at the Carthage camp, an accident occurred: a laborer from the port excused himself from the transport team on the pretext of having a stomachache and tried to escape from the team. He was discovered by patrolling cavalry on the way. Under their pursuit, the laborer Jump off the cliff and fall into the sea.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   To the Carthaginians, this was a trivial matter, and no one mentioned it again after the transport team arrived at the camp.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the past two days, Miltias' uneasy mood has improved a bit, because the Sicilian fleet made great efforts in the night attack the night before, not only winning a great victory, but also suffering minor casualties. He believed that after receiving this good news, the Ministry of Military Affairs , will reduce dissatisfaction with him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After breakfast, he was ready to go to the dock to command the fleet to leave the port and cruise in the waters of western Sicily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the Carthaginian army landed in Sicily, to support such a huge army, it was not enough to rely on the help of the Carthaginian allies in western Sicily. More supplies also required continuous transportation from the continent of Africa across the sea. Coming over, this requires the Sicilian fleet to cut off the route between Carthage and Sicily. Over time, the Carthaginian army will fall into the dilemma of insufficient supplies, so Miltias does not dare to slack off anymore.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But before he could leave the house, the door was suddenly pushed open, and the guards rushed in: "General, good news! Lord Sekerian...is still alive! He...he's back!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Miltias was shocked. Looking at the guard's excitement, he subconsciously asked: "Who do you think is alive?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Miltias, blessed by Hades, of course I am still alive!” Along with this familiar voice, a familiar figure appeared at the door.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Ah…Lord Cecilian!” Miltias hurriedly gave a military salute.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Sekerian looked thin and tired, and was tightly wrapped in a red cloak. He said eagerly: "Get me some food quickly, I am almost starving to death."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Go and inform the kitchen to reheat the porridge, toast the bread, and fry some fish...” Miltias quickly ordered the guards.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Whatever is hot, just bring the bread and wheat porridge. I'll fill my stomach first." Sekerian said impatiently, then turned to the fleet officers who accompanied him here and said: "Brothers, hurry up. Go back and perform your mission. If you delay, you will be punished. I will have a good chat with you after I have rested."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A large group of crew members gathered outside the door listened to Sekerian's words of persuasion, reluctantly left the house and returned to the dock. The news that "Czekerian came back alive" quickly spread throughout the fleet, and every crew member was excited. Because the naval commander and hero they thought was dead came back, it was a miracle!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Watching Seclian devouring breakfast, Miltias choked on what he wanted to say, until Seclian burped, then stopped eating, put his hands on the wooden table, and stared blankly A clay pot containing wheat porridge. After a moment, he said in a low tone: "On the way here, the brothers all told me...Florarios died in the battle, and almost the entire Sicilian fleet was destroyed by the storm, and many brothers drowned..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Miltias watched Seclian's whole body slowly lean forward, as if his whole body was about to collapse on the wooden table. He was about to speak when he suddenly heard a "pop" sound, and Seclian's right hand suddenly He slapped it on the wooden table, almost knocking over the earthen pot on the table, but he straightened his back again: "However, we still have dozens of warships preserved, but the Carthage fleet was completely destroyed. We also took the opportunity to occupy Selinus, so my Sicilian fleet won that naval battle!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   With confidence and sternness returning to Cykerian's face, Miltias certainly would not argue with him about whether the decisive battle with the Carthaginian fleet on the stormy day was right or wrong. Instead, he took the opportunity to raise his doubts: "My Lord , we have been looking for you for a while, but have not found you, where have you been?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “I’m in Lilibei.” Sekerian said calmly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You...you were captured by the Carthaginians?!" Miltias was surprised: Why did the Carthaginians who came to exchange prisoners before never mention this? !
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Of course not." Sekerian recalled painfully: "... After the storm, I woke up and found myself lying on the beach, surrounded by drowned and unconscious crew members... I wanted to save them, but I saw When the Carthaginians arrived on the beach, I didn't want to be captured by them, so I swam into the sea again...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But I was tired and hungry at the time, and I was exhausted after swimming for a long time. There happened to be a few slow-moving Carthaginian ships nearby searching for survivors of the shipwreck... In desperation, I dived into the water, taking advantage of the darkness of the night. While the Carthaginians were not paying attention, he grabbed the side of a large ship that was about to return, and was taken into the port of Lilybae.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Due to the storm and shipwreck, the harbor of Lilibi was in chaos, so I was able to board the pier quietly. Later, with the help of the Greek compatriots in the port, I temporarily lurked in Lilibi... I later recalled that I was lying on the pier at that time. The beach is probably between Mazara and Lilibi...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because the people of Lillibin were worried about being attacked by our army, the city was always heavily guarded and it was difficult for me to go out. If it weren’t for the Carthaginian army landing this time and requiring us to transport baggage, I’m afraid I would still be waiting for an opportunity in Lilibi City, but——”
