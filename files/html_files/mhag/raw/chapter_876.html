   Chapter 876 Battle of Lola (1)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Zantiparis's sincere words greatly touched the generals of the Campania League. Aialos immediately thought of the plight of Naples: too many refugees were concentrated in the city, food was scarce, order was difficult to control, and finally The fear is about the occurrence of epidemics.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The generals of cities like Herculaneum and Litrum are eager to lead the people back to their homes, but their towns are in ruins. Once the Samnites invade again, it will be difficult for them to defend themselves... Will they have to defend themselves in the future? Continue hiding in Naples? Not only are the people intolerable, but their citizen soldiers may also oppose it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing that the generals of the Campania Alliance were thinking sadly, Zantiparis said: "Our soldiers are indeed a little tired after the hard battle, but they have time to rest at least, but don't the Samnites who came from afar not Are you tired?! It took them a whole day to get here from Beneventom. I'm afraid they didn't get much rest on the way. They would only be more tired than our soldiers. They can still run as fast as they did before. Wind?!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Besides, our soldiers have just captured the city of Lola and their confidence has been boosted. However, the Samnite people are worried about Lola and are anxious, so their fighting spirit is not as good as our soldiers. What's more, even if the Samnite reinforcements There are 10,000 soldiers. Our soldiers still outnumber them. Don’t forget that their team also includes more than 2,000 warriors from Nakonia. The spies of Abenirum have already said that they have Someone was sent to quietly contact the leader of the Naconian army, so these more than 2,000 Naconian soldiers are not allies of the Samonite reinforcements, but are helping us at a critical moment! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Zantiparis said this, his mood became high-spirited: "Everyone, we have so many advantages. We should seize this favorable opportunity in time to proactively confront the invading enemies, defeat them, and drive them away completely. Get out of the Campania plain and let the people of your Campania alliance find peace and tranquility!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xantiparis's words made most of the generals feel excited and their doubts disappeared.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But some people raised objections: "Can the words of the Abenirum people be believed?!" The Samnites and the Campanians have been fighting for decades, and both sides regard them as mortal enemies. How can they be believed easily?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before Zantiparis could answer, Aialos said first: "The Abenirumites assisted General Alexis in defeating the Samnite army in the mountains, and are still besieging Beneventum, why not Worthy of trust! Abenirum is Dionia’s ally, and of course our friend! The same goes for the Nakonians. Don’t forget that we were able to capture Lola City because of their contributions!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, it is not that the Naconian people had no conflicts with the Campanians in Lola, but Enona officials tried to separate their work to reduce contact. For example, the work of trimming tree trunks and digging soil was all handed over. To the Nakonian people, they were not allowed to participate in the construction of the earth mountain, and they were allowed to rest further south in Nakonia at night. Of course, another reason for this was to prevent the Lola defenders from seeing the Nakonians and Dionia has close contacts so as not to bring disadvantages to the Enona warriors who are still in the Samnite coalition.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The general stopped talking.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Aialos looked at Zantiparis and asked solemnly: "If we lead the army to meet the Samnite reinforcements as you said, can we win?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Zantiparis answered equally solemnly: "As long as we fight with all our strength, we can win!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Aialos' previous concern was that once the coalition forces were defeated, it would be difficult for the slow-moving Campania heavy infantry to escape the pursuit of the Samnites. By then, the situation of the Campania Alliance would become even worse than before. Oops.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the Dionysian army fought twice on the Campania plain, and he personally participated in and assisted, and was impressed by the strong military capabilities of Dionysus. Therefore, Zantiparis's affirmation gave him confidence, So he faced the generals of the Camparian Alliance and said loudly: "Everyone, with the full help of the Dionian Allies, we will definitely be able to defeat the Samnites! Don't hesitate any more, call the soldiers immediately, Go out of the city to meet the enemy and drive them completely from the plains of Campania!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This time no one objected.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the Dionian coalition formed outside the city of Lola early in the morning, the Lola defenders felt something bad. They asked a small team to sneak out of the city. After paying many casualties, they rushed in from the hilly area in the southeast. Ridge, escaped the siege, and rushed to Beneventom for help. At noon, just at the entrance of the mountain road from Cavutim to Beneventum, they encountered Segovani's returning army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Segovani learned that the city of Lola was in danger, and without hesitation issued the order to "speed up the entire army" and at the same time sent spies to quickly inform Sesara.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In this way, Cavutini's army left the mountains and entered Cavutim's territory. They did not enter the city to rest at all, but continued to march forward, passing through the wider passes between the mountains and arriving at Abella. ). Here, they joined the 1,300 warriors sent by Sesala, bringing the total force to more than 9,000. This is the largest force that the Kautini tribe can send now.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This army walked out of the pass, entered the Campania plain, bypassed the mountains, turned south, and headed straight for the city of Lola.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the road from Kautim to Lola is all flat, the day's march still made the Samonei mountain people who were good at running and full of physical strength feel tired. Many tribal leaders asked Segovani: Let the soldiers rest for a bit.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But he was rejected by Segovani. From the descriptions of several Lola messengers, he had realized the determination of the Dionia-Campania coalition to capture Lola, and he had to go as soon as possible. Reinforcements to prevent this town, which is very important to the Cavutini tribe, from being controlled by the Dionians, because that means that the southern part of the Cavutini territory will be cut off, which he cannot allow.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   About ten miles away from the city of Lola, Segovani received a report from the spies sent to Lola to explore: "The enemy's army is coming out of the city of Lola and is coming towards us. There are many soldiers!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Are you sure the enemy came from Lola City??!” Segovani looked in disbelief.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Big Chief, when we approached the city of Lola...the battle was over. We only saw many Campanians carrying corpses outside the city...the enemy did leave the city through the north gate of Lola. They were fully dressed, It doesn't look like the battle that just ended..." Detective Cavutini said with a sad expression.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Segovani was shocked. Although he led an army to help urgently, he did not think that the Dionysian coalition could capture Lola City, which was defended by thousands of Kautini warriors, in just a few days. Now the situation has developed beyond his expectation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But he only pondered for a while, and then said fiercely to the somewhat bewildered leaders: "Didn't we keep complaining, 'If the Campanians didn't hide in the city like turtles and didn't dare to fight us, we would We have long occupied the entire Campania plain!' Now the opportunity has come. Those timid Campanians dare to take the initiative to attack us. They really think that with the help of the Dionysians, they can From a group of rabbits to wolves?! Their number is about the same as ours, and they have just finished their siege, so they come at the right time. We can kill them completely, not only to recapture Lola, but also the entire Campania There will no longer be any force to stop us on the plains, and the situation on the entire battlefield will be changed by us Kautini people!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The leaders were aroused by Segovani's fighting spirit, and they all clamored to fight the enemy to the death.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, the order "the whole army stopped advancing, rested on the spot, and began to form array" was executed by the leaders.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before, Vasonk had been anxious. He originally thought that the Cavutini army would rest in Cavutim City after walking through the mountain road. Unexpectedly, they came all the way to Lola, so he could only quietly Send his men to inform other Naconian leaders about the news that "the Naconian people have escaped from Segovani's control and have formed an alliance with Dionia."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now that he got the news that "there is going to be a battle with the Campanians, the entire army will start to form a formation." Vassunke felt even more anxious, because Segovani also gave a tyrannical order: the armies of various tribes in Naconia must immediately Follow the prescribed instructions and disperse to the designated positions in the military formation. No refusal or delay is allowed!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The designated position Segovani refers to is to place the armies of more than a dozen Naconian tribes widely in the front or rear of the left, center, and right wings of the entire military formation, so that they cannot communicate with each other during battle. , let alone cooperate with each other.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, the Naconian army is now a hot potato for Segovani. Based on what he did in his territory before and now that Dionia has occupied Naconia (he believes that Naconia (Nia was occupied by Dionia), if the Naconian army knows the truth, rebellion is certain.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   According to Segovani's idea, it would be best to completely dismantle them and forcibly integrate them into the armies of other tribes. This would of course provoke resistance from the Naconian army. It was not that Segovani didn't try at the beginning. When the Samnite coalition forces met in Beneventum, he made this suggestion to several other tribal leaders, hoping to use the superiority of the coalition forces to suppress the Nas. The resistance of the Konya soldiers took the opportunity to break them up.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, this proposal was opposed by Badani and Kontruk, especially Kontruk. He sternly rebuked this approach. He believed that it was Quinduq's fault for colluding with foreign enemies. He and his tribe had been subjected to They were punished, and the other Naconian tribesmen performed so bravely in the battle (the Naconian army was driven by Segovani and always charged forward) that it was enough to make up for their past mistakes, and the leaders of each tribe It is the military tradition of the Samnites to lead their tribesmen in battle, and destroying this tradition will only frighten other tribes.
