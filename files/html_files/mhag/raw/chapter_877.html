   Chapter 877 Battle of Lola (2)

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Contruni's words hit the mark on what Segovani was worried about. When he discussed privately with other Kautini leaders who were closely related to him, he also encountered strong opposition, which forced him to give up. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But the situation of the war changed so quickly that he had no time to think of a better way to solve the problem of the Naconian army. The rumors in Beneventum were spread by him in order to confuse the public. Although the effect seemed to be good, it was only a temporary measure. It is also expedient to disperse the Naconian tribal armies in the military formation. But if they are not sent out to fight, where will these more than 2,000 Naconian warriors be placed? Cavutim or Abela? This will only make Segovani even more uneasy, and he firmly believes that only under such an arrangement, the Naconian soldiers will fight bravely and not dare to mess around.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is indeed the case. The reason why Vasonk is anxious is because the Naconian army seems to be a whole, but in fact there is no leader who can convince everyone and make them obey orders. Everyone is temporarily elected and leading the army for the first time. None of the young people had much prestige, including Vasonk. Although they knew that Segovani's order was not good for them, with the Naconian army at a numerical disadvantage and surrounded by other tribal warriors, no young Naconian commander had the confidence or courage to stand up. , raise your arms, and then all Naconian warriors will obey the order and launch a rebellion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So, although the Naconian generals expressed their opposition, they finally obeyed the order unwillingly and led their troops to leave. And this dispersion makes it impossible to communicate with each other during battle, let alone to achieve unified action.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Vasonk couldn't do anything when he saw the situation. He could only curse the cruel and cunning Segovani in his heart, and waited for the opportunity.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Segovani adopted the traditional fighting method of the Samnites against the Greek army. The horizontal lines of the military formation were very long, as long as three miles, and the length of the columns was not small. This was because the Samoni military formations It is very loose, and the distance between warriors is large, making it easy for them to pass through each other.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At dusk, when the sun had set over the sea in the west and the sky and sea were dyed golden, the enemy figures appeared in Segovani's field of vision. Their thick armor was slanted by the sunset, giving off an eerie glow. A sparkling but not dazzling light.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The wall of light on the opposite side did not scare Segovani and the soldiers. On the contrary, they felt reassured because they had defeated such opponents countless times in the past, but the length of the opponent's army exceeded Segovani's expectations. , it extended to both sides, so that Segovani could not even see both ends of it. This was somewhat different from the dense and thick square formation tactics of the Campania army in the past.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Is this the way the Dionians fight? Segovani murmured in his heart that although he and the Dionians had fought once, it was a pursuit battle and the two sides had not yet had a formal battle.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But he could see that the opponent's soldiers were still densely arranged, so the opponent's column must be thin. Of course, Segovani could guess why the opponent had formed a military formation before they arrived at the battle site. This obviously meant that the Campanians had learned lessons from the past, because the clumsy Campanian army was always there. While forming a slow formation, they were attacked from a distance by the fast-moving Cavutini warriors.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Segovani hesitated for a moment, but decided not to adjust the deployment easily, but to test it out for a while and see what the situation was.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Dionysian coalition stopped advancing when they were less than 400 meters away from the opponent. This military formation, which was 3.2 miles long but had only three horizontal lines, had become winding after advancing for a certain distance. Before fighting, straighten the battle lines again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There are more than 6,000 heavy infantry in the center of this military formation (including about 1,500 reserve legion soldiers from Dionia), and then there are 3,000 mixed light armor and light infantry troops on both sides, including the Dionia light infantry brigade. Connected, there are 500 Dionian light armored soldiers at both ends. In addition, there are more than 200 Campanian cavalry on the outermost left wing, with a total strength of approximately 11,400.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dionia's opponent, Cavutini's army, has a total strength of more than 9,000 people, with an array of three miles long. Most of its troops are light infantry. These light infantry are also divided into two types, one is pure javelinmen, The other type is light infantry with long shields, who can fight with both javelins and spears. They form the main component of the Cavutini army formation. Only in the rear of the center are there nearly a thousand armored infantry. Segovani led it himself.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Cavutini and the League of Campania, two sworn enemies for decades, today, on the edge of the eastern plain of Campania, each has devoted all its forces and is about to engage in a battle that will determine their respective fates. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But just when the Dionia coalition stopped and began to reorganize their formation, Segovani had already given the order first, and the light infantry in the middle of the Kautini army began to move forward. When the middle moved, the left and right wings They also moved one after another.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The movement of the Cavutini military formation is different from the heavy and slow movement of the Greek military formation, and its speed is very fast.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Aialos knew this very well. As the commander-in-chief of the Naples army, he stood in the front row of the array. Zantiparis once advised him to "not go to the front line in person, but to command the overall situation from the rear." He politely refused. The generals elected by most Greek city-states often stayed on the front line during battles to show that they were no different from the soldiers in status, so as to avoid being criticized by the citizens after the war. Naples was no exception, especially at such an important time. time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, he took off his Corinthian helmet without hesitation and threw it on the ground. The other Campania heavy infantry also took off their Corinthian helmets according to the pre-planned plan like Aialos, and all of them suddenly realized their vision. Open and relaxed. Only the Dionian heavy infantry did not take it off because they wore open helmets.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Aeolus looked around, raised the spear in his hand, and shouted loudly: "Apollo bless us! We must pursue bravely and never stop!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The surrounding soldiers and team officers also shouted: "Pursue bravely and never stop!!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the Cavutini army approached 50 meters, almost all the Dionian coalition soldiers were shouting, and their fighting spirit was very high.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Zantiparis, who was riding behind and riding on a horse, heard the thunderous roar, and his nervous mood became much calmer.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Attack!” he shouted.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Woo!..." The high-pitched bugle sound made the entire long military column, whether heavy infantry, light infantry, light armor, or cavalry, begin to advance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The sudden forward movement of the Dionia coalition did not have any impact on the warriors at the forefront of the Cavutini army. They stopped at a suitable distance, threw the javelins in their hands, and then They prepare to retreat through the gap, so that the warriors behind them are in the forefront, and they continue to throw javelins... Repeatedly, in this way, even if the opponent is advancing, they always keep a distance from the opponent. The javelins continued to be thrown, causing great damage to the opponent's dense phalanx.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the past, the Campania League had not received specialized training. It had neither light infantry that could compete with it nor designed tactics specifically for independent light infantry. It was impossible for the temporarily recruited civilian light infantry to fight against almost all of its members. He is a powerful Cavoutini harpooneer, so often after three or four rounds of throwing, the Campania army has to stop advancing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then, the Cavoutini warriors immediately switched from retreat to attack, still throwing waves of javelins to attack. When they threw all the javelins in their hands, the Campanians had basically fallen into chaos due to too many casualties. After that, Cavutini's armored infantry and light spear-carrying infantry made the final impact, often defeating them in one blow and establishing the victory.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But now, the Cavutini warriors were surprised to see the heavy infantry on the opposite side speeding up and getting faster and faster.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Are they going to charge? ! Don't they know that it's impossible for us to hedge against them, and with their cumbersome speed, it's impossible for them to catch up with us! ...Although the Kautini warriors were surprised, as the distance got closer, they had to move backwards, and their first round of javelin, according to custom, because the distance was still far (more than 30 meters), so they took Throwing it slightly upward can make the javelin fly longer, and the location where it falls is often in the middle and rear of the opponent's formation, thus causing chaos in the entire formation and disjointing it from front to back, making it easier for the next attack. However, the opponent's sudden acceleration and thin columns caused most of the javelins thrown to miss.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The coalition heavy infantry who had escaped the javelin attack became more confident. They raised their round shields at an angle and half-protected their heads, and their steps became more powerful and faster. This caused the distance between the two sides to be quickly shortened to less than 20 meters, and the Cavutini warrior who threw the javelin later had no time to be more fully prepared, so he hurriedly threw the javelin in his hand.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The 500 Naconian warriors led by Vasonk were part of this second wave of attacks. They had received hints from Vasonk in advance. Most of the warriors threw their javelins into the sky at will, and then immediately retreated. withdraw.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Greek heavy infantry's desperate charge made Vasonk's mind change rapidly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even though the Kautini warriors threw in a hurry, they were experienced and took a straight shot in this round of javelin throwing. Countless heavy javelins were thrown by the warriors' strong arms and driven by the leather ropes. With some rotation, they pierced the shields protecting the heavy infantry. Many javelins penetrated the shields directly, causing injuries to some heavy infantry.
