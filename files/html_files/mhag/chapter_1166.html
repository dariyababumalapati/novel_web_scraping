   Chapter 1166 Printors' Suspicion
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This will not only allow the camp to become a camping ground and military food storage place for the Theonian army in the Arcadia region, but also to protect this place and defend it from whether it is coming from the north or from the north. Spartan troops to the south to prevent them from threatening the new city of Megalopolis.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Having said this, he looked at Lycomedes and said solemnly: "It will take at least three days to build the camp. After the camp is basically built, His Highness Crotokatax will lead the main force to continue eastward, passing through Thailand. Gea, go north to rescue Mandinia and defeat the Spartans..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   His words caused a commotion among the Arcadian MPs. Everyone discussed quietly for a while, and they all agreed with the Theonian plan, thinking that They were more considerate.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The first person to respond was Lycomedes. Because he understood why the other party was looking at him and speaking, he immediately expressed his position: "We Mandinians are confident that we can hold on for at least a month!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then someone else said: "After our soldiers are assembled, we will rush to Mandinia as soon as possible to fight the Spartans with you.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors responded with a serious look: "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Our soldiers are very happy to have the opportunity to fight side by side with the citizens of Arcadia!"
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But based on the current situation, I have a suggestion for your reference... This is the center of your alliance, and there are many villages around it, but it lacks sufficient protection. Although we will build camps in the east to block the Spartans. Invasion, but we are not familiar with the geographical environment here. We don't know whether the Spartans will climb over the mountains, bypass the camp, and raid Megalopolis... Therefore, I suggest that the army you form should be stationed here, with Our troops staying in the camp will defend against the Spartan attack together..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Printors made this suggestion, Crotokatax was surprised, because it was a little different from the plan they had discussed before, But he suppressed his doubts and did not raise objections on the spot.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors' words moved the Arcadian councilors a little, and after a short discussion, they agreed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, they expressed their opinions on Clotoccata Their attitude has changed greatly and they have become much more enthusiastic. After all, the Spartans are now invading the territory of the Arcadians, but now it is the Theonian army that is completely in front, avoiding the Arcadians. They could not help but feel guilty for the excessive casualties suffered by the Cardians.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Crotokatax and the others bid farewell to the Arcadian councillors, mounted their horses and went to catch up with the army, Printors took the initiative to The young commander explained: "Your Highness, please forgive me for taking the initiative and changing the previously discussed plan.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The previous military plan of Theonia was to let the Arcadian Alliance send an army to fight side by side with the Theonia army. This would not only enhance the friendship between the two sides, but also have the Arcadian army as a guide, which would undoubtedly Let the Theonian army integrate into this unfamiliar war zone faster.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I think Lord Printors must have an important reason to do this.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Klotokatax said in a gentle tone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reason why Printols dared to make arbitrary decisions and change plans temporarily was because after spending this period of time with Clotokatax, he was used to treating him badly. He has a deeper understanding of his character that considers others. At this time, Clotokatax's considerate and considerate words gave him another reassurance, and at the same time, he became more determined to assist the young prince.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors cheered up and said seriously: "Your Highness, although you were very generous in not pursuing the assassination just now in order not to affect our alliance with the Arcadia Alliance, even if the assassin came from Olympia , how did they know that we would be meeting with the Arcadian Alliance Councilors today?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   How did they wear the same color Bolton as the Arcadian senators, avoid the inspections of the Arcadian soldiers, and blend into the team?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ...These cannot help but cause us to think deeply, because it will affect our next battle with the Spartans?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You mean..." Clotokatax said thoughtfully: "There are spies among those Arcadian senators?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printos further reminded: "The Arcadian Alliance was just established, but the alliance between these city-states in Arcadia and Sparta lasted for decades, and they are all allies of Sparta. The longest lasting and strongest relationship among them. Although they have betrayed Sparta now, I think there is no shortage of people close to Sparta in their country..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax thought solemnly for a moment. , and then said hesitantly: "Are you worried that when we fight with the Arcadians, they will... suddenly turn friends into enemies?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   That's why you proposed to let the Arcadian army stay in Megalopolis and prevent them from joining us?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Highness. "
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Printors said sincerely: "In the kingdom's past wars, your wise Majesty has cleverly instigated rebellions within the enemy many times, thus shortening the time to achieve final victory.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because of this, we must be more careful about the enemy using this strategy on us, especially now that we have to go all out to fight the powerful Spartans. If the allies on our side suddenly attack us, then The consequences will be disastrous... Therefore, to be on the safe side, it is safer for us not to let the Arcadians participate in the frontal battle.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What's more, with the current strength of our army, it is enough to deal with the Spartans. Without the drag of the Arcadian army, we will be able to command the army more smoothly and fight more resolutely!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I understand. Thank you Lord Printors for the reminder. I agree to implement the new plan.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Klotokatax still seemed a little doubtful: "It's just... without the assistance of the Allies, how can we get help from the local people in the next battle?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Instead of being regarded as enemies by them?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Highness, not all Arcadian city-states had close relations with the Spartans in the past.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors' reminder made Clotokatax's eyes light up: "You mean Mandinia!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ...It seems that while we are building the camp, we have to send someone to have a good talk with Lycomedes, hoping that he can send us some Mantinians as guides.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Yes, Your Highness."
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Printors said respectfully, this was not pretentious, but came from the heart. In his opinion, although this young prince lacked military experience, he was not only good at listening to the opinions of his subordinates, but also once prompted, He can quickly draw inferences. He is definitely not a puppet that can be fooled. He is worthy of having the blood of the god Hades.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, they have caught up with the large marching troops.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldiers who have been marching for a long time are already under the command of the team officers. The "Song of the Legion" was sung next, and Crotocatacus immediately rode close to the marching column. He sang loudly with the soldiers regardless of his status, and even shook his head when singing excitedly, not only not making the soldiers feel funny, but also singing "Song of the Legion". On the contrary, it makes them feel friendly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The majestic and heroic singing washed away the fatigue of the soldiers and echoed in the hills and mountains, causing the Arcadian MPs to stop and listen. Although the lyrics were not clear, it did not affect them from sighing: "Theonian soldiers Their morale is very high!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Not only is their morale high, look at their equipment and their marching. This is a well-trained army. They are fully capable of fighting against Sparta!" "It's
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   just that Confrontation?! You and I have fought with the Spartans many times. The Spartans are indeed well-trained, but how many are there! Look at this Theonian army again. It has been so long. I still I didn't see the end of the team! I'm afraid the number mentioned by the Theonian general was correct. Their number of soldiers exceeded 30,000, and the sparse Spartan warriors were probably no match for them!" "Just look at it
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   . Can we tell the combat effectiveness of an army by marching? I think we will only know the strength after the two sides actually fight!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In any case, we will feel very at ease with the powerful Theonia as an ally!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " Don't forget, the powerful Sparta was our ally in the past, but why do we still need to form an alliance? Hey! We are afraid that we will drive away an old wolf king and usher in a new wolf king!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The key is This new wolf king has different beliefs than ours. They think Hades is the Lord of the Gods! Otherwise, why would the Olympians assassinate the Theonian commander! Everyone, don't forget, Zeus He is also the patron saint of our Arcadia Alliance!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as these words came out, there was silence all around.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lycomedes hurriedly said loudly: "Everyone, our covenant with Theonia makes it very clear that both parties respect their respective religious beliefs and will never slander or interfere with each other... You don't have to worry at all in this regard! Now Si The attack of Bada's army is related to the survival of the alliance. We need our powerful ally Theonia to help us repel the enemy. This is what we should do most at this time, and other things can be ignored for the time being!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lycomedes is right!" Some councilors loudly agreed, but some others remained silent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lycomedes was a little helpless. This was the current situation of the alliance. He had spent too much energy to convince them these days, and now he felt a little tired
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ... ………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the mansion of Ipamelonda in Thebes, Pelopidas has just arrived.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Ipamilonda, what's been going on with you these past two days? As soon as every meeting is over, you disappear immediately. What are you doing hiding at home?!" As soon as Pelopidas saw Ipamilonda, He acted as if he wanted to raise an army to hold him accountable.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ipamilonda knew her best friend and said calmly: "The quietness at home helps me calm down and think."
