   Chapter 1120: Continuous Battles and Victories
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Gauls had no navy and could not take advantage of their large numbers when attacking from land, so they were never able to capture them.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Instead, due to the rush from Florentia, the food he carried was almost exhausted.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So the Gauls sent tribes one by one to nearby villages to collect grain.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, shortly after the autumn harvest, the Etruscan people had plenty of food at home. However, due to the menacing attack of the Gauls, most of the Etruscan people fled in a hurry and had no time to carry food, so they went everywhere to collect food. The Gallic tribe warriors gained a lot and soon alleviated the problem of tight military rations.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although there is no need to worry about military rations, the leaders of Gaul have realized that Fufruna is not Florentia, and it will be difficult to capture it in a short time, so they have the idea of ​​"ignoring it first and turning around". Attack elsewhere" idea.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But just when they had just reached an agreement, the northern coalition forces of Theonia appeared.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This time Patroclus did not adopt the conservative strategy of building the camp first, but began to form an array directly one mile away from the Gauls' camp.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Based on Patroclus's observations during this period, he believed that the Gauls were strong, brave and capable of killing, and were very likely to come out to fight.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sure enough, although some Gauls had not returned to camp because they had gone out to collect food and grass, under the instigation of the leaders, the chief still decided to lead less than 30,000 Gallic warriors out of camp to fight.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Patroclus also learned from the sentry that some Gaulish warriors were collecting food and grass in nearby villages and towns but had not yet returned. He immediately sent a small number of allied troops to attack and hinder the return of these Gauls. At the same time, he also All the light infantry under his command lined up and launched a long-range attack on the Gallic army while it was in formation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   More than half of the Gallic warriors were wearing straight trousers and single clothes, and some were even shirtless. They had no other defense except the wooden shields in their hands.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There are more than 4,000 light infantrymen in the Theonian coalition. Among them, the 2,000 light infantrymen of the Theonians as the main force are even more well-trained. Under their leadership, the arrows and javelins fired are like those in the Alps. The hail was as terrible as the hail, which caused a lot of damage to the Gallic army, and forced the Gallic warriors to ignore the formation and kill the enemy one after another.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Gauls swarmed forward, and the allied light infantry retreated hurriedly. After they quickly withdrew from the gaps in the chessboard formation, the Gauls suddenly discovered that a long and thick "iron wall" appeared in front of them. Behind the wall The enemies shouted in unison, and the javelins once again enveloped the Gauls like dark clouds.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Amidst the continuous screams, the Gauls roared, brandished their swords, and struck hard at the enemies hiding behind their long shields.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then they discovered that their sharp swords were not enough to split the enemy's thick long shield, or to immediately cut off the enemy's strong spear. Even if they could sometimes break the long shield and cut the enemy's body, if the force used was not strong enough, , is not accurate enough, and cannot cause fatal damage to enemies wearing neck guards, iron helmets, and double-layer chain armor.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The enemy on the opposite side will quickly draw out the dagger at his waist and stab him fiercely, which may make the strong Gauls lose their fighting ability.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Only then did the Gauls realize that they were no longer fighting the Romans. They would not be wearing simple equipment and holding copper spears. They would attack them like a swarm, and then after suffering setbacks It will collapse quickly again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What they are facing now is a formidable and powerful enemy armed from head to toe. They are well-equipped and well-trained. Not only is the overall coordination tacit, each soldier will rely on the overall strength to fight, but his personal combat skills are also excellent. Most of the stabbing spears and daggers were accurately aimed at the vulnerable faces, necks, abdomens, and legs of the Gauls. Even the Gallic warriors did not have much protection all over their bodies.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What's more, the number of Gallic warriors is smaller than that of the Theonian coalition, and this is not an equal battle at all.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As long as the Theonian soldiers as the main force (mostly Romans and Latins) can eliminate the terrible shadow caused by the Gauls in their hearts for more than ten years, they can fight against the opponent's enemies who are waving their swords, slashing and screaming. Fighting calmly and calmly under a ferocious appearance, there is no doubt that victory in such a head-on battle is inevitable.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Previously, Patroclus first commanded the army to win in the defensive camp, and then led the army to raid the Gallic camp in the early morning, and then performed extraordinary feats. The coalition soldiers gained confidence from this. Now the Theonian soldiers with high morale are facing Not only is he not afraid of the nightmare he once had, he is also eager to gain military merit and obtain rewards from the kingdom.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Less than an hour into the fierce battle, the Gauls were in decline. Patroclus took the opportunity to order some of the allied troops on standby to attack both flanks of the Gauls.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The battle lasted until noon, when the Gauls were defeated and the coalition forces led by Patroclus won another great victory.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The news spread back to Rome and surrounding areas, and the people cheered and even organized their own parades, singing and dancing around the city. Finally, they climbed to the Capitoline Hill and presented strong black cattle and sheep to the Temple of Hades and the Temple of Diana respectively. The two great gods offered devout sacrifices to thank them for their blessings to the people.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Such a similar scene also occurred in the Latin city-states and the southern Etruscan city-states. The haze caused by the Gauls' invasion of them more than ten years ago was finally blown away in this series of brilliant victories created by the Theonian coalition. scattered.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Asistes read the battle report from the front, he couldn't help but sigh: What a terrible future!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty knows people well!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the king's residence in Thurii, Cynthia sat alone in the inner courtyard, looking slightly depressed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a while, I saw a six- or seven-year-old boy running out of the living room leading a three- or four-year-old boy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Palpilas, run slower, be careful! Don't drop your brother!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Grandma, don't worry, I will take good care of my brother!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I told you not to run away, but you still ran out with your brother as hard as you could. How can I be relieved?" Kristoya scolded gently, at this moment She doesn't have the usual demeanor of a decisive leader of the chamber of commerce. She just looks like a traditional Greek noble lady who takes care of her grandchildren and talks a lot: "Chris, come to grandma!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I don't! I want to be with my brother. Play!" The little boy grabbed Parpylas' hand and shouted stubbornly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Kristoya's almond-shaped eyes widened and she was about to get angry.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Sister, you can rest assured and let Chris play with Palpylas. With the slaves watching, nothing will happen." Agnes then walked out of the door and said to Chris Toya said with relief.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, Kristoya refused to give up and said with a stern face: "We are going to the zoo, not to the sports ground or market in the city. Those beasts don't care who we are. If we are bitten or injured, it is not What a joke! When the time comes, his mother will have something to say, 'I told you not to let Chris leave his parents at such a young age, and now something has happened!'... By then, maybe she will Reason, take Chris back to Rome!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After saying that, she took two steps forward, bent down, stretched out her hands and said: "Chris, come to grandma quickly."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I don't!" The little boy was quite stubborn. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Palpilas, take your brother and stay close to grandma. Don't run around. Do you hear me?" At this time, Cynthia stood up and said to her son in a majestic voice.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I know, mother." Parpylas responded quickly, took Chris's hand, and returned to Kristoya obediently.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Kristoya quickly grabbed one in each hand, and after holding the hands of the two children, she relaxed, glanced around, and asked: "Where is Eunice?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Molina, the internal affairs supervisor standing aside, responded immediately : "Princess Eunice followed Princess Aviya to the zoo early in the morning."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Grandma, let's go find sister quickly!" Chris urged in a sharp voice as he shook Christoya's hand vigorously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Kristoya frowned, bent down, and said seriously: "Chris, grandma has told you many times, you must remember it! Eunice and Aviya are your father's sisters, you should call them Their aunt, otherwise they will be laughed at if other people hear it! Remember, call them aunt!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "...Aunt...Aunt..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "By the way, you will call them that when you see them in the future. If you call them wrong again... "Christoya deliberately made a face: "Grandma is going to spank you."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Chris likes grandma, and grandma also likes Chris, and grandma doesn't know how to spank." Chris said, and hugged Chris tightly with her little hands. Listoya's thighs.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You smart little guy." A smile appeared on Kristoya's face: "Okay, grandma won't fight, but you can't call me wrong again."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Chris nodded hard.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Christoya pinched his little face lovingly, turned to Agnes and said: "It seems that Aviya really likes animals. She is usually an introverted child, but Eunice has always forced her to Taking her to do this and that, it's rare for her to be so proactive this time!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agnes said with a smile: "She really likes animals, but the main reason is that her father told her, 'When she becomes an adult, let her do it. Manage the zoo,' so now she goes to the zoo whenever she has free time, saying that she wants to learn more about the... habits of animals?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Kristoya said with a smile: "I see, at this point, Aviya is Like you, you usually don't care much about other things besides presiding over the Temple of Hera, but since the construction of the zoo started, you have complained of illness many times and instead of going to the Temple of Hera, you went to the zoo."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agnes Silk smiled: "Except for celebrations, the temple is usually managed by priests. The chief priest does not have to go every day, just like Plesinas." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haha, that's what I told you before, but how do you answer? 'I am a priest of Hera, so I should serve her every day...'" Christoya imitated Agnes' tone and said pretentiously.
  </font>
 </font>
