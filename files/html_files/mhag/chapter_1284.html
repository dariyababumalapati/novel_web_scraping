   Chapter 1284 In Memphis
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Amidst the cheers of the Egyptian people, Davos got into the carriage and drove into the palace of Naukratis.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The next day, Davos led the second and first legions north. Under the advice of Asistes and Amenhotep, he did not take a warship, but took a land route, riding a gorgeous The carriage, led by a group of Egyptian priests led by Amenhotep, marched along the south bank of the Nile tributary in a fashionable manner.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For other parts of the Mediterranean, it is now planting season, but in Egypt sowing has long since ended.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the flooded Nile River receded in August and September last year, the huge temporary pools built by farmers to prevent the river from flowing away too quickly were almost drying up. Instead, green wheat seedlings spread all over the banks of the Nile. Lush green papyrus also grows along the banks of the Nile River and its tributaries, making the entire Nile Delta region look like a sea of ​​green. Occasionally, small patches of yellow can be seen in this refreshing sea of ​​green. It was a village built by the Egyptian people with mud bricks.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But beyond this huge oasis is a very dry and dusty, vast desert.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos sat in the carriage and walked between the yellow and green world, feeling quite strange in his heart.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While he was marching towards Memphis with his army, his speech at the port of Naukratis had been spread by interested people, and it seemed to have grown wings, and soon spread to both sides of the Nile.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Egyptians heard three main meanings from his words: first, Davos wanted to be the new pharaoh of Egypt; second, the huge army stationed by Theonia in Egypt was not to continue to provoke war in Egypt, but to It is to attack Persia and protect Egypt's tranquility; third, Theonia will not come to snatch the Egyptians' land, and Egypt is still managed by Egyptians.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Egyptians know that Theonia has always kept its promises. When there was a war with the Greek mainland, they still sent a large number of troops to help Egypt resist Persia. What's more, this was publicly announced by King Theonia in front of the Egyptian people. The probability of breaking a promise given by a speech given is very small.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the Theonian army put down the Egyptian rebellion, it has remained in the territory. There have been rumors that "Theonia wants to annex Egypt" for a month. Now the King of Theonia personally admits that he wants to be the pharaoh of Egypt, and It also received support from the priests of the Temple of Amun, which made many Egyptian officials and local forces feel mixed. At the same time, they also breathed a sigh of relief and rushed to meet the new pharaoh in person or send envoys in order to leave a good impression.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For ordinary Egyptian people, land, faith and peace are what they long for most, and since Davos has made a promise in public, most people not only are not angry that a foreigner is about to become the pharaoh of Egypt, but instead express Without a certain degree of enthusiasm, they wanted to know what the king looked like with a Theonian army that could compete with the ferocious Persians.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This season is a temporary slack period for the Egyptian people. Usually they would make mud bricks, catch birds, and fish in their free time. At this time, everyone rushed to the roadside with their young and old to welcome the arrival of the new pharaoh.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the suggestion of Amenhotep, Davos changed his appearance in the city of Naukratis. He officially put on the red and white crown representing the rule of Upper and Lower Egypt, and also put on a false beard representing the identity of the pharaoh, and then Wearing a golden one-piece armor, riding in a magnificent carriage, he looked solemn and unpretentious along the way.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Egyptian people, who have always respected gods and feared power, saw the new Pharaoh sitting atop a magnificent carriage with dazzling golden light from a distance. They all felt awe and shouted long live.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Towns passing through also opened their doors to welcome him, and officials rushed to show their loyalty.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos comforted them all the way, and the entire team was not moving very fast. They even briefly visited the pyramids in Giza, and finally arrived in Memphis more than ten days later.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Memphis is located south of the Nile Delta and north of Upper Egypt. It is right between Upper and Lower Egypt, so it is called "the scale of the two sides."
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The early capital of Egypt was Thebes. From the Middle Dynasty to the present, more pharaohs set their capital in Memphis because it was more conducive to the rule of Upper and Lower Egypt.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Davos entered the city of Memphis, he immediately understood why Chalcides had been able to easily capture the Egyptian capital that was occupied by the rebels. Because unlike other Mediterranean city-states, it did not surround the entire city of Memphis with thick walls. Instead, city walls were only built in three places, one was the Temple of Ptah, the other was the Temple of Osiris, and the other was the Pharaoh's Palace and the noble residential area.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is almost impossible to resist the siege of the Theonian army with such a small city area and meager military resources, not to mention that it is still very unstable internally.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Memphis's handicrafts and metal processing industries are famous throughout Egypt. Half of the city of Memphis is occupied by handicraft workshops and its residential areas. Therefore, Ptah and Osiris, the patron saints of these two industries, are highly respected here. People not only worship Memphis' The three pillar gods Ptah, Sekhmet, and Nefertem also worshiped Osiris, the god of the underworld, and even monks regarded the Apis bull as a sacred object and enshrined it in the temple.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, Davos also imagined using Osiris as the incarnation of Hades in Egypt, replacing Amon and becoming the highest belief of the entire Egyptian people, but obviously this would require a long process.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Among the officials who came to greet him, of course, they also included the priests of the Temple of Ptah and Osiris. Davos promised them that he would take time to go to the sacrifices and let them leave with satisfaction.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After appeasing the officials in Memphis, Davos did not go to the palace immediately. Instead, he went to the Theonia military camp outside the city to condolences the soldiers. For this purpose, he specially took off his fake beard, took off his red and white crown, and put on a gold crown. , entering the military camp as the king of Theonia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At dusk, he drove into the Memphis Palace. The palace guards quickly took over the protection of the palace, while Hernepolis took over the internal affairs of the entire palace and asked the royal chefs who came with the team to prepare a safe and delicious dinner. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos invited Asistes, Tapyrus, Chalcides and the commanders of the legions who subsequently led their armies to Egypt to thank them for their efforts during this period.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The atmosphere of the banquet was not very lively because Davos did not allow drinking.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the banquet, Davos left them behind and held a meeting.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Today, all our troops have entered Egypt. With such a large number of soldiers, it may be difficult to fully meet the needs by relying solely on logistical supplies from the distant Kingdom. Is Egypt capable of providing long-term and sufficient logistical support for the army? Asistes, you have been in charge of the administrative affairs of Egypt in the past few months and have a sufficient understanding of the situation in Egypt. What do you think?" As soon as Davos opened his mouth, he raised the question he was most concerned about. After all, his real purpose in personally leading his army this time was to defeat Persia, and the annexation of Egypt was just a matter of convenience.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty." Asistes was well prepared for this. He replied seriously: "It is really difficult to meet the needs of the entire army if we rely solely on the food reserves in the Nile Delta. You have to know that it was only the food reserves that supplied Karl some time ago. The army led by Commander Sidis has already emptied the grain warehouses in the towns in the Nile Delta, and now there are still two or three months before the grain harvest-" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Egypt is not known as the Mediterranean granary. There is too much food to eat. Finished?!" Matonis, commander of the First Army, interjected.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This is because Nectanipos launched a rebellion a few months ago, which caused turmoil in Lower Egypt. In order to protect themselves, various towns had to urgently recruit troops, resulting in a huge increase in food consumption in various places. If Commander Chalcides had not acted quickly , It took a short time to quell the unrest in Egypt. I am afraid that the subsequent troops arriving will have to completely rely on the kingdom's logistics supply." While explaining, Asistes also praised Chalcedis for his role in Egypt. The military and political leaders of Theonia, the two have been cooperating well in the past few months.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Chalcides smiled at Asistes as a token of his gratitude.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos saw it and didn't have much disgust. Fighting outside, only by uniting as one can win. This is the concept he has always emphasized. He asked calmly: "Asistes, although you can It seems very difficult, but you are not nervous at all. It seems that there must be a way to solve the problem of military food supply."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty is wise!" Asistes smiled and said calmly: "Egypt has always been based on agriculture. The Lord therefore attaches great importance to the cultivation and storage of food. Like a kingdom, it has granaries in large towns to store the collected food for use in times of famine (what the Egyptians call famine refers to June and July) The flood of the Nile River was too small during the period, so the area of ​​cultivated land was significantly reduced when the flood receded, resulting in a significant reduction in food production), or waiting for the price of food in the Mediterranean to rise before selling it...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, there is another force in Egypt that reserves a large amount of food. Food is the temple. Monks in various Egyptian temples own a large amount of land and slaves, especially in Upper Egypt. These monks do not assume administrative responsibilities and only provide a small amount of food to believers during temple celebrations. Sharing, so their food reserves far exceed the granaries of various towns...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is precisely because the monks in Egypt are too rich and have too much power that Jie Hao issued a decree to suppress the power of the monks when he was in power." Although in order to let Dionis Asia successfully annexed Egypt, and Asistes had to cooperate with the Egyptian monks headed by Amenhotep. However, as an administrative official, he could not stand the popularity of these monks in Egypt and could not help but say more. One sentence.
