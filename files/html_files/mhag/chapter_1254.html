   Iphicrates, looked in the direction of his finger, and then showed a sympathetic look on his face: "He must be Thurii who just arrived yesterday, so we didn't meet him in the hotel. To him. Speaking of which, he is quite pitiful. His son who was seriously injured in the Greek war died of illness last year, and they Spartans are all idiots with well-developed limbs and simple minds. Under the new Spartan government They were no match for the cunning Pileas and the Helots supported by Messelia and Arcadia (some of the Spartan Helots once moved to the Tegea territory to which Mantinia belonged. Therefore, he has a good relationship with Mantinia, who is the leader of Arcadia), so he, who is almost 80 years old, still insists on attending the New Spartan Parliament..." "

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If it weren't for his constant running around, We have almost forgotten the Spartans." Callistratus sighed: "What a respectable old man!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus did not know that there were two acquaintances not far away. Talking about him behind his back, the reason why he only arrived yesterday was because he had been ill before and had just recovered. He ignored the doctor's dissuasion and came to Thurii. How could he give up such a person who could meet King Davos? Good opportunity to get some benefits for the Spartans.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to satisfy his long-standing wish, before he died, he took a stroll around Theonia, which he had been deliberately trying to deal with for decades.

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Yesterday, it was already dusk when the passenger ship arrived at the port of Turiyi. After getting ashore, exhausted, he got on the carriage sent by the Turiyi City Hall to the port to pick up and drop off distinguished guests. He fell asleep after getting on the carriage and did not appreciate it. Landscape of the city of Thurii.

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This morning, when he was led into the main arena of Hades by the guide, even though he had seen countless big scenes in his life, he was still shocked by this huge building.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He looked up, as if a frog at the bottom of a well could only see a small circular patch of sky above the tall building, but the boiling sound of the gradually filling auditorium made him feel insignificant.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He has participated in all four major sports games in Greece. He has also led troops to intervene in the sports games several times, but this is the first time he has seen such a large and imposing competition venue. He is carefully looking at this special venue. At that moment, a voice came from the side: "Agesilaus, I'm glad to see you!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus looked back and saw that it was Pelopidas, the current military governor of Boeotia, standing there. Next to him was an acquaintance who also impressed Agesilaus - Epamirondas.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pelopidas was smiling, and Ipamelonda nodded to him, although her face was calm.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, Agesilaus's face twitched a few times, and he said coldly with a sullen face: "I'm not happy to see you!" After saying that, he turned around and ignored the two of them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is not surprising that Agesilaus had such a reaction, because in recent years he has been regretting that Sparta should not have launched the Theban War, otherwise it would not be in such a bad situation today.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And it was the two Thebans in front of him who had led Thebes to fight fiercely with Sparta for many years and also defeated the Spartan army in the Battle of Leuctra. How could he give them a good look?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus's response made Pelopidas slightly embarrassed. He smiled self-deprecatingly, shrugged at Ipamilonda, and said loudly on purpose: "I didn't expect that we are all in the same alliance now. He still thinks about the past." It's a grudge."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Compare the current situation of the Thebans and the Spartans. It's strange that he can see clearly." Ipamironda said softly and understandingly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before the Theban War, Sparta was the overlord of Greece and had garrisons in many city-states in Central Greece, including Thebes. The Thebes government officials went to meet the Spartan garrison generals and knelt like slaves meeting their masters. Not to mention the general public.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Unexpectedly, more than 20 years later, the real Spartans have been reduced to the point of extinction, but with the strong support of Theonia, Thebes has not only completely integrated the entire Boeotian region, but also vigorously developed Oropus and the port in the Gulf of Corinth promoted maritime trade with Theonia, thus greatly improving the shortcomings of the Boeotian region and making it the second largest force in the Greek League (the first largest force It is the Holy Kingdom of Theonia. After Athens disbanded the Maritime Alliance and lost those sub-states, it fell behind the Boeotian League in terms of land area and number of citizens, but its population and degree of commercial development were still higher than those of Boiosia. , but because Thebes has a closer relationship with Theonia, most Greek people believe that Boiosia is stronger than Athens), which greatly enhanced their voice in the alliance and also made the Thebans more influential in mainland Greece. status rose sharply.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thirty years to the east of the river and thirty years to the west of the river, the status of Sparta and Thebes today is completely reversed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Indeed!" Pelopidas laughed heartily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus in the front row felt harsh when he heard the laughter, but he could only pretend not to hear it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Sit down quickly, don't block the audience behind." Epamironda reminded him. He felt that it was completely unnecessary for Agesilaus to take a small revenge on his friend.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He is an indifferent person by nature. Since the establishment of the New Greek League and the unification of Thebes in the Boeotian region, he has voluntarily resigned from all positions. If it were not for this time, Theonia's invitation letter to the Boeotian League specifically stated Ipamilonda was appointed to attend, but he was probably still living in seclusion at home.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Pelopidas sat down, he looked around with interest, and then said excitedly: "The invitation letter from Theonia to us said that they will hold a unique sports meeting. I see this arena It's very different. At least none of the Greek city-states, including us in Thebes, have the ability to build it!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes!" Epamelonda also sighed: "Do you remember watching the sports games in Corinth when we were young? , only to see the time when Theonia's contestants were expelled? At that time, who would have thought that Theonia, who was humiliated by the audience, would become the overlord of the entire Greece just over 20 years later, and invite All the city-states and countries in the Mediterranean participate in the sports games held by it!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What you said reminds me of it." Pelopidas said half-jokingly and half-seriously: "I heard that even if Theonia becomes the Greek League After becoming the leader of the alliance, foreign athletes in Dioria participating in various sports games in recent years will still be discriminated against by the Greek people, so the king of Dioria was so angry that he held this sports meeting and allowed all races in the Mediterranean to participate. This is a big country Such magnanimity! Unlike our Greek city-states that are stubborn, conservative and petty!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Do the Greek city-states you are talking about also include our Thebes and Boeotian alliance?" Ipamilonda asked lightly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pelopidas did not respond, pointed to the side not far away, and said gloatingly: "Look, General Cleonian of Corinth is there! I wonder what kind of mood he would have sitting in this arena. , are you worried that the Theonian Games will surpass the Corinthian Games and become the most popular sports meeting among the Greek people?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Not only Corinth will be worried, I think Ellis and Delphi will also be worried. Look, aren't their envoys sitting there!" A voice came from beside them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ipamelonda immediately stood up: "Lucomedes, good morning!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Good morning, Pelopidas, Ipamelonda! I'm glad to be sitting with you!" Lycomedes He raised the ticket in his hand, pointed to the number on the stone bench, and said with emotion: "When I came to Turiyi, what amazed me most was not the hugeness and prosperity of this city, but the people here. There are so many, but they can be managed in such an orderly manner! Now it seems that this is probably because the officials of Theonia are very serious and meticulous in the governance of the country ~
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You think, even the entrance to the arena (everyone The entrance is numbered (corresponding to the number written on the ticket), the stone staircase (there are wooden railings on the side of the stone staircase to prevent falling), and the seats are carefully designed to prevent so many spectators from entering the arena without confusion. By It can be seen that they have penetrated this kind of meticulous management into all aspects of people's lives..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Yes, think about any previous sports meeting where there were no conflicts due to spectators competing for seats. Those of us who are the mother country Not only should you feel ashamed, but you should also learn from Theonia with humility!" Pelopidas said seriously, and then made a polite gesture of invitation: "Lycomedes, please sit down!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the Greek War , among the Greek city-states, the one that benefited most was not Thebes, but Mandinia. Not only did they obtain the fertile land of the original Tegea, but they also established the Mandinian Empire with the strong support of Theonia. The Arcadian Alliance, with Asia as the main body, became a major force in Greece.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pelopidas once envied Ipamelonda in private, "In order to establish the Boeotian Alliance, we in Thebes fought hard with Sparta for many years and sacrificed many people... and Mandinus Apollo was just lucky enough to follow Theonia in the Greek war, and finally achieved this goal easily. Apollo is so biased!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, Pelopidas, who is lively and cheerful on the outside but very proud on the inside, However, he showed sincere respect for Lycomedes, because he not only proposed "the establishment of the Arcadian League" for the first time, but also worked tirelessly for many years, and therefore served as the chairman of the Arcadian League for five consecutive years. (The highest office in the Acadian League Council can only be held by Mandinians).

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I just heard you say that Theonia is going to hold a unique sports meeting..."
