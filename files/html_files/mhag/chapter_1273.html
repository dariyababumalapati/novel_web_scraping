   In Chapter 1273,
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   someone suggested in the marathon final that we should start from the vicinity of the Turiyi Military Camp and run to the Hot Springs Swamp. This would not only have a very important commemorative significance (the Great Swamp Annihilation Battle was the foundation battle of Theonia), but also give full play to the map. The ability of Riyi athletes (Thurii athletes participating in the marathon are all young soldiers of the First and Second Legions. They conduct military training near the Tulii military camp all year round and are completely adapted to the terrain there).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Some people also suggested that we should run from the vicinity of the port of Turiyi to the inner city of Turiyi, which is also of great commemorative significance (Davos led the mercenaries to land at the port of Turiyi and finally established it in the city of Turiyi to the Kingdom of Theonia), and is also conducive to the final award.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Some people also suggested that the starting point of the long-distance running route should be near the port of Thurii and the end point should be at the foot of Mount Amendolara. This is also of great commemorative significance. After all, King Davos led his army to land in Magna Graecia from the port of Thurii. , first established a foothold in Amendolara, and this route is conducive to the performance of all contestants.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After repeated consideration, Clotokatax led the preparation team to finally adopt the third suggestion. The main reason is that this route is flat and open, which can help all participants to complete the race smoothly. After all, this is the first time to run a long-distance marathon. Held, if the competition is too difficult, many players will not be able to complete it, which is not conducive to future promotion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the start of the Games, the marathon has been attracting much attention from the people of Theonia and foreign tourists, and like the boat race, it is impossible to collect tickets because the competition range is too wide, so on the day of the competition, Turiyi and People nearby, including tourists, rushed to both sides of the track, surrounding the route from Turii Port to the foot of Mount Amendolara.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to prevent the game from being disrupted, Clotokatax even mobilized troops to maintain order in the game.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The audience was huge, and the lineup of contestants was equally huge.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the Theonian Games preparatory team announced the creation of the marathon two years ago, a saying gradually spread in the Greek world, "Athletes who can complete the entire marathon are considered real athletes."
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Under the influence of such public opinion, more than 200 players signed up to participate in this project.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There are no qualifiers, no semi-finals, just one game to decide the winner.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the high-pitched start whistle blew, the athletes rushed onto the track in a swarm and slowly ran towards the finish line amid the cheers of the audience.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There was also a sea of ​​people at the end of the long-distance race. The thoughtful preparatory team set up a VIP seat on a nearby hill so that they could overlook the final stage of the race. Representative envoys from various regions and city-states in the kingdom were now sitting there one after another. Go to the VIP table.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pelopidas found his seat, and found that the messenger from Athens was right next to him. He immediately smiled and said: "General Callistratus, congratulations, congratulations on Athens' victory in Theonia." The lead in the Games!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's only temporary." Callistratus waved his hand modestly: "The Games are not over yet, and everything is hard to say. Besides, we all understand that the so-called first and second don't mean much. , the sum of the scores obtained by the various regions of Theonia far exceeds the sum of all our city-states. Theonia is just comparing its regions with our entire city-state." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then what? How about it, since Theonia chooses to use this method to compare the competitiveness of various city-states, then you must be convinced if you lose." Penopidas said confidently: "Not to mention the picture of Theonia. The Li region exceeds our city-state in terms of population, land area, and prosperity, so being able to win is a reflection of strength." "What
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   you said makes sense." Callistratus seemed to respond a little Perfunctory, in fact, that's what he was thinking: Nowadays, Athens is far behind Thurii in terms of military strength, population, land area, and trade level, but at least Athens still has an advantage in sports competitions.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Listening to what you two are talking about, it seems that the first place is already guaranteed. But let me tell you, the difference between Arcadia and Athens is only two points. Maybe when the marathon is over, Arcadia can overtake it, because We have several good long-distance runners." Lycomedes suddenly interrupted.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The preparatory team arranged for the city-state envoys at the top of the medal list to sit together, which was really well-intentioned.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "When it comes to long-distance runners, we have several in the Piocia League. Among them, Pantacris won the 3-kilometer long-distance race before, and this time they all also signed up for the marathon. The final champion must belong to Him!" Pelopidas said quite proudly. He had just congratulated Callistratus, but now he showed a proud look as if he wanted to grab the first place in the medal list.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Can a three-thousand-meter race be compared with a marathon? That is an ultra-long distance of nearly ten miles!" Callistratus, who had been modest just now, said not to be outdone: "The reason why the Theonian Games is There is this competition event because of the glorious battle in Athens - the marathon! We have more than 15 runners who have signed up for the competition. They have been training unremittingly every day for more than a year to bring the glory that should belong to Athens. Go back to Athens!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You are thinking too much, Callistratus." Lycomedes sneered: "Although the marathon race did start because of Athens, today's Athenian athletes can win in this competition. Is it a good ranking? I'm not optimistic about it. Marathon long-distance running requires not only abundant physical fitness, but also a strong will to run such a long distance. Can the Athenians who are used to enjoying themselves endure such hardship? ? I find it very embarrassing! But we Arcadians, who trek between the mountains every day, are more able to endure hardships and stand hard work." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The most hard-working people are farmers. You mean that you can get this by sending only one farmer? Champion of the event competition?!"
  </font>

   Ipamilonda looked on as these three, who can be said to be the most powerful figures in the Greek city-states, were arguing over whether their city-state could finally win the Games standings. , I couldn't help but secretly sigh in my heart: Think about it. At the opening ceremony of the sports meeting, they all looked relaxed, full of curiosity, and with a bit of a joke mentality, and now they have completely fallen into it.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not just them, look at the envoys from other city states around them, the same is true.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although it is the first time for the Theonians to hold a sports meeting, it should be a great success just like they do other things.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ipamilonda was thinking in her heart and said: "You don't have to fight. I think this marathon championship is likely to be won by a Theonian athlete."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Why?" Pelopidas knew his This best friend usually doesn't like to talk, but he always has something to say.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ipamilonda said seriously: "Based on my understanding of the Theonia army, the Holy Kingdom of Theonia conducts long-term military training for citizens year after year, and one of the important training projects is armed Long-distance running, long-distance running training of more than 5 miles is carried out almost every 7 days, so the Theonian army marches very fast in the war, and can continue to fight, in many battles in which the Theonian army participates This characteristic is reflected in all of them."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus, Pelopidas, and Lycomedes looked at each other and suddenly stopped talking.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although what Ipamilonda said was reasonable, Callistratus and the others were still holding on to luck. After waiting for more than an hour, the contestants finally appeared in their sights, but no matter how they glared at them, With big eyes and attentive attention, no familiar figure was found among the runners at the front. On the contrary, the spectators on both sides of the track cheered thunderously, and even shouted the names of the runners in unison.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus and the others suddenly felt frustrated, because the vast majority of the Theonian audience could make such a move, and the runners running in front could only be Theonians, or even very likely. Thurii people.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Their inference was correct. The runners at the front were all from the Turiyi area, and the runner in the leading position was named Alcinis. At this moment, after running for a long time, not only did he not feel Fatigue, but more and more excited.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Compared with the immature five years ago, Alsinis now serves as the main force in the First Army, and was promoted to squad leader at the beginning of the year. He also married the daughter of a military veteran. For him, this year It was a great year, and two days later was the anniversary of his biological father's death. He decided to win the marathon championship, and then sacrifice this honor to his biological father's tomb to pay tribute to his father who died in the war before he was born. : The child has grown into an upright man. He can rest assured in the Elysee Paradise!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Today's weather is rare and cool, and the sea breeze mixed with moisture blows on his face. Listening to the audience shouting the same name as his biological father, his feet are getting bigger and faster
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ... ……………………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The top three runners in the marathon were eventually won by Theonia runners, and these three runners were all from Theonia No. 1 , the second legion, thus enabling the Theonia Thurii region to surpass Athens in sports points and win first place in the standings.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This frustrated the expectations of Callistratus and others, and also made other city-state envoys feel relieved. After all, under the influence of Theonia's powerful national power in recent years, it is normal for them to have such thoughts: Daionia It is natural for Onia to win the first place in the Games, so why should Athens put pressure on us?
