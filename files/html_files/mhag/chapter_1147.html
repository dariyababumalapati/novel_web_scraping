   Chapter 1147 Recognition

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "In addition, you have to send someone to inform Tisias and ask him to lead those from Tyndares to persuade and mobilize as many helots as possible to help us unload the baggage on the cargo ship... ..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Muklu took the order and left.
  </font>

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides said to Adoris again: "Go and inform the soldiers of the First Legion not to pursue the enemy any more, and not to march further north. Gather at the Spartan military camp immediately and seize the time to expand that camp. . And...where did the Spartans escape into the mountains? Send two soldiers to take me to see."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides could roughly guess where the Spartans might have escaped from, but he It also needs to be confirmed with your own eyes so that you can make defensive arrangements.

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Having witnessed the power of the Theonian army's ballistae with his own eyes, Dolios realized on the way to retreat that even if he retreated to the military camp, he would not be able to defend it for long (due to the constant attack Foreign enemies invaded, and the defense facilities of the Spartan military camp in Messenia were insufficient and relatively crude), so he decisively issued two more orders: First, he handed over the command of the army to the adjutant and asked him to lead the soldiers to retreat to Thailand. The Lagunda Pass in the Getos Mountains tried to preserve Sparta's army of more than 400 people, mostly composed of real Spartan warriors; secondly, he sent messengers to the city of Pylos on the west coast , informed the soldiers in the city that the Theonian army had landed in Messenia, ordering them to abandon the small city and retreat north as soon as possible.

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But he himself decided to stay. Even if he died in battle at the gate of the military camp, he would never escape because he knew very well that although the enemy army was powerful, retreating was completely justified for the sake of preserving strength. , but losing Messenia is definitely a big deal for the Spartans. The resentment and rumors of the people will always surround him. As a former member of the King's Guard and a veteran for more than 20 years, he will never want to honor has been slandered.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It's a pity that he only killed one Theonian soldier before he was stabbed in the thigh by a javelin thrown by the enemy and became a prisoner, despicable Theonian!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, he was held hostage by two soldiers and brought into the big tent. Under the candlelight in the tent, he saw a Theonian general wearing black armor sitting directly in front: He had short hair and hair, and no beard on the chin. I heard that the Theonians have a strange habit of not keeping beards and hair, but this person looks like he cannot be younger than 50 years old... Huh?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Huh!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Spartans, tell me, how many soldiers have you deployed in Messenia? How many are Spartans?" Leoticides asked coldly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dolios didn't answer, he just stared at Leoticides' face, and even couldn't help but take a few steps forward.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The guards on both sides immediately grabbed him and shouted: "The commander is asking you something, answer it quickly!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dolios tried hard to break free from the soldiers' grasp, and shouted excitedly: "Leotichid Si? You are Leotychides!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leotychides was suddenly shocked. He thought that he had changed a lot after leaving Sparta for so many years, and most of the Spartans who were familiar with him back then were probably not dead. , even though he has retired, it is impossible to recognize him on the battlefield, but he did not expect that his identity would be exposed as soon as he set foot on the land of Peloponnese.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Muklu next to him immediately shouted loudly: "This is Lord Proseus, the commander of the Theonian army. He once led an army to defeat the Carthaginian army, capture Syracuse, and conquer Gaul... It is Dio The famous victorious general of the Kingdom of Nia! Spartan, please stop being so arrogant and answer the general's questions truthfully. If you behave well, we will consider releasing you back to Sparta!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He is really a lieutenant. Oticides, the son of our former King of Sparta, Agis!" Dolios still stubbornly pointed his finger at General Theonia directly in front of him and said loudly: "I will never admit my mistake! He has a tattoo on his chin. That scar was left when he was knocked down by the alpha wolf when we were sent by the instructor to hunt wild wolves. If it hadn't been for me, he would have been bitten to death by a wolf long ago!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dolios said with a nose and an eye. Several other people inside subconsciously looked at Leoticides: Indeed, Proseus did have a relatively obvious elongated scar on his chin.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If Leotychides had grown a beard and tied up his hair, perhaps Dolios was not sure, but except for the wrinkles on his face, Leotychides now looked the same as when he was young. Not much has changed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   With the continuous reform of Sparta's political system in the past few decades, the king's power has been almost lost. However, in addition to the right to command troops, there is another right that has not been deprived, that is, princes do not need to participate in brutal military training since childhood. Otherwise, babies like Agesilaus who were born with foot diseases would have been thrown into the cracks of the valley long ago. However, Leoticides was one of the few royal family members who actively applied to participate in Agego training. Naturally, He attracted a lot of attention from other Spartan teenagers in the military camp, but because of his character, he rarely paid attention to other people. However, the wolf kiss that almost killed him left such a deep impression in his memory, so even if the situation in front of him was The Spartan had disheveled hair and bloodstained face, and he could roughly guess who he was.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The world is so small!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ...Leoticides sighed in his heart, and then said in a deep voice: "Keep this prisoner, you all retreat."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Muklu looked at Leoticides and saw that he looked calm and calm. Perseverance, he opened his mouth, but in the end he didn't say anything and turned around and left the tent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the two guards hesitated: "Commander, it is too dangerous to leave this Spartan alone in the tent!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Am I afraid of an injured Spartan? Get out!" Leoticides said without refusal.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The guards exited obediently, leaving only Leoticides and Dolios in the tent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two looked at each other. After a while, Leoticides broke the silence, pointed to the wooden bench next to him and said: "Sit down.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dolios was not polite, dragged his injured left leg and sat on the bench. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I didn't expect to meet you here, Dolios.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Leotichides said slowly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I didn't expect that the prince of Sparta would become the general of Theonia!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Dolios sighed with hidden sarcasm.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What's unexpected about this? Agesilaus became king. If I didn't escape from Sparta, would I rather stay in Sparta and be constantly accused of being a bastard? , and then like my mother... like my mother, suffered injustice and hanged herself?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Leotichides's voice was trembling, and his rare emotion was a little excited: "At that time, except for Theonia, which dared to oppose Sparta just after it was established, the other city-states were either allies of Sparta or Sparta. Being affiliated with Spartan, I didn't have many options...but now it looks like I made the right choice, so here I am today.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You made the right choice?!" Dolios suddenly became angry when he heard this: "Theonia raided the precious property left to us by our ancestors - Messenia without declaring war. This It's a completely dishonest act! Do you know how much difficulty losing Messenia will cause us in Sparta?! How many people will lose the nobility of citizens because of losing the territory of Messenia? Being reduced to a lower class because of your status?!...Just because you have enmity with King Agesilaus, you will not hesitate to hurt all Spartans. Don't forget that you are also a Spartan!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoti Chides knocked on the table with his hand and said calmly: "I am now a citizen of Theonia, and it is not up to me to attack Messenia. It was an order from His Majesty Davos. Besides, if you don't defend, The credit goes to Sparta. It was you who ended the peace agreement early so that Thebes had the opportunity to ally with our Theonia. You violated the Callias contract and led your troops to attack Thebes and Theonia again. Of course the covenant must be fulfilled..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "But Thebes has signed an armistice agreement with Sparta!" Dolios roared.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I have indeed heard rumors about this in Theonia, but Thebes did not send an envoy to inform us, and Theonia is so far away from mainland Greece that it is impossible to determine whether this rumor is true or false, so the attack The plan has not changed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, there are some citizens in Theonia who are from Messenia. His Majesty Davos promised them back then that he would "restore Messenia's independence" and he has fulfilled his promise today..." Oticides said lightly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "So Theonia has decided to become the enemy of Sparta?!" Dolios said fiercely: "Don't think that Theonia is king and hegemon in the Western Mediterranean, and you think you have no rivals, just because of your Undeclared war and our lack of preparedness allowed you to succeed by chance! But soon we Sparta will gather a large army to retake Messenia. By then, I am afraid it will be the turn of the Theonian soldiers to become Sparta is captured!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It would be best if Sparta really sent a large army to fight for Messenia." Leoticides emphasized his tone, with a strange light shining in his eyes. Looking at Dolios, he said meaningfully: "In fact, even if you don't say it, we are very aware of Sparta's current situation. There will be no more than 500 Spartan warriors stationed in Messenia, and all Spartan warriors The total number of Spartan warriors was less than 2,000. Therefore, the Council of Elders passed a resolution in these years to grant some Pilians and a very small number of Helots as Spartan citizens, but did not give them land. In fact, Their status is still low in the world, their desire to fight is not strong, and they even have conflicts with the Spartan warriors...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Also, the long-term continuous fighting makes many Spartan warriors unable to supervise the work of their helots. Therefore, they were unable to pay enough taxes and were deprived of the qualifications for public meals. In fact, they have been reduced to inferior people. They must have deep resentment in their hearts. I think the situation in Sparta now is probably even worse than when Kina Dun was hunted. Oops..."
