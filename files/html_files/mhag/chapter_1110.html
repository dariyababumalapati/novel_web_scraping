   Chapter 1110 Revenge (continued)

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Okriton heard this, he was surprised at first, and then became angry. He couldn't help shouting and asked: "Why are you doing this?! Even if you are the Magonid family and Lord Hanno, There are grievances, but you are a Carthage, and the blood of Queen Dido, who founded Carthage, still flows in your body. How can you do such a wrong thing that threatens the survival of all Carthage people!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " Did you come here just to teach me a lesson?" Although Haka's voice was soft, it was like a cold breeze blowing, making Okriton's body feel cold and immediately driving away the dissatisfaction in his heart. He quickly regained his composure: "I... Lord Haka, even though you have served Theonia now, you are still a Carthaginian. I hope you can stop letting the Eastern Numibians continue to invade." Carthage Territory's approach will give your compatriots a way to survive!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Okriton lowered his posture and spoke in a very sincere tone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I did this to give my compatriots a way to survive." Haka restrained his laziness and said seriously: "If Carthage continues to secretly confront Theonia like this, it will do no good to Carthage! In a few years you will find that Carthage is completely isolated in the entire Western Mediterranean, and even the closest Phoenician allies will move away from you one by one..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the peace agreement was signed with Theonia , We in Carthage have been re-adapting to the new order in the past few years and are busy restoring trade. We have never had any intention of secretly confronting Theonia, nor have we taken any hostile actions. I don't know Lord Haka. Why do you say that! On the contrary, Theonia incited the Eastern Numibians to invade Carthage. This is a violation of the agreement. Does Theonia want to tear up the good image of 'keeping promises' that he has always advertised? Once again Declared war on Carthage?!" Okriton looked filled with indignation and said sadly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka looked at him coldly and whispered one word: "Masili tribe."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This voice immediately broke through Okriton's disguised anger. He wanted to defend himself, but heard Haka continue to say: " Do you need me to recite the full text of the secret negotiation between Carthage and the Masili tribe?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Okriton was immediately discouraged, and was even more frightened that Carthage was under such terrible surveillance by Theonia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "From the conspiracy between Carthage and the Masili tribe, it can be seen that you, the Carthage Senate, still have some illusions. But I believe you who have witnessed the grand scene of this giant city of Thurii, Even if the Masili tribe gets your help and really unifies the tribes of West Numbia, it will be nothing more than a small trouble for the now powerful Kingdom of Theonia. We even only need to easily dispatch two or three A legion can completely pacify it. But for you Carthage, this will be a disaster related to the survival of the city-state, so the kingdom allows the Eastern Numibians to attack Carthage to make you truly realize that Carthage How weak Taiji is now!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka signaled the slave to pour him some wine, then slowly turned the wine glass with one hand, his expression became serious: "I am a Carthage, I know it very well Most of my compatriots prefer doing business rather than waging war, prefer enjoying themselves to suffering on the battlefield, and are more afraid of death... Therefore, even when Carthage was at its most prosperous, it was never able to defeat the Greeks in Sicily. It's because the Carthaginians are not a nation that likes to fight. They lack bravery and tenacity. In the past, they could still let Numibians and mercenaries fight for you. Now you have no one to rely on. I think Carthage's The senators can extinguish any remaining ambitions in their hearts and let the people do what they want! For
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   example, the Carthaginians did not like bathing in the past. Since the Theonians invented the bathhouse, the Carthaginians I started to like bathing; for example, in the past, Carthaginians did not like to go inland to do business because the transportation was very inconvenient, but since the Theonians built wide and flat roads, Carthaginian merchants have also frequently gone deep into the country. Go to Bruti, Lucania and other mountainous areas to gain trade profits... and the water pipes like the water pipes I just talked to you about. As long as they start to be put into use in ordinary urban areas of the kingdom, I can guarantee that it won't be long before the Carthaginians They will think about how to make it so that they can enjoy clean water without going out... There are many examples like this.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You see, although the people of Carthage hate Theonia on the surface, they are actually paying attention to it all the time. The new things created by Theonia enjoy the huge trade system created by Theonia... So why not let Carthage be completely integrated into this system? In this way, Carthage The safety of the people will be completely guaranteed, and the people will enjoy everything built by Theonia with peace of mind. I believe that with the ability of the Carthaginians, in a few years, they will become richer than before !"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Okriton was silent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka didn't speak any more, but gently stroked the warm pool water with his hand.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a while, Okriton asked in a low voice: "You mean... let Carthage and Theonia form a true alliance?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "With Carthage's current weak strength, it is impossible Establishing an alliance with equal status to Theonia can only become an ally affiliated with Theonia." Haka said very straightforwardly: "Of course, I suggest that Carthage should become a free city of the Kingdom of Theonia. , just like Tarantum, you should know how comfortable the Tarantum people are now..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Okriton's face became a little ugly, and he suppressed it and did not let his anger rise again. He rose up, but heard Haka say leisurely: "I know you can't make the decision on this matter. In the end, the Senate has to make the decision, but I hope you can make the decision faster, because you and Masili The evidence of tribal collusion is conclusive. Once the Masili people stir up chaos in West Numbia, the Theonian envoys will go to Carthage to question you about violating the peace agreement.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, Sicily's The three legions will also quickly assemble and be ready to land in Africa at any time. By then, Carthage's situation will not be as easy as it is now when you and I are talking."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Okriton's face changed drastically and he said hurriedly: "Ha Mr. Ka, we have some verbal agreements with the Masili tribe, but that is only for the Eastern Numibians-"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka interrupted him unceremoniously: "That's all for the discussion on this matter. So far, what kind of choice should Carthage make? You go back and think about it yourself, and let those stupid senators think about it. Now let's talk about another thing. You came to Thurii to prepare for the interview. Another thing His Majesty discussed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Aren't you surprised? In the past few years, the precious metals transported by the Theonian cargo ship from Iberia were sold to all the merchants in Carthage separately, but starting from last year, they But they are only sold to merchants who belong to the neutral faction..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Okriton looked at the young man opposite with a strange smile on his face, his heart jumped suddenly, and he said in surprise: "Could it be you -"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, this is also my suggestion to His Majesty." Haka said lightly, turning to look at the slaves: "The water temperature is a bit low, let them heat it up some more."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Master, but your body -"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I feel very good today, it doesn't matter if the water temperature is higher."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The slave looked at Okriton, whose face was a little ugly. Although he was a little worried, he didn't dare to disobey Haka. He quickly ran to the wooden door and gave instructions to the slaves waiting outside.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course it was impossible for Okriton to suddenly burst out and hurt someone, but the eyes he looked at Hakkar now were full of alertness and caution, as if he were facing a strong enemy: this young man who looked very sick was so terrifying, and what he had done Every measure taken against Carthage hit Carthage's vulnerable areas hard.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka took a slow sip of the wine, and then looked at the remaining bright red wine in the wooden cup. His eyes became solemn and distant. He murmured: "When I was 5 years old and sensible, I learned from others. I know why I am different from other children, because I may die within a few years;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   when I was 9 years old, my father returned from Sicily in defeat. He was depressed all day long, often because of what he heard from others. He mocked and locked himself in the house alone, and eventually he committed suicide...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When I was 13 years old, I followed my brother to that strange and barbaric land in Iberia. My uncle Mago told me, 'This is In order to give the Magonides family a bright future.' But I actually knew in my heart that this was because my uncle failed in the power struggle in Carthage and had to find a way out for himself;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   when I was 27 years old At that time, the people of Carthage were completely wiped out by the Sicilian army. Under the instigation of some people, they angrily attacked the Magonid senators, forcing them to be unable to survive in the city and could only flee with their families to Iberia, but Dido and I decided to find a way out for ourselves...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After experiencing so many things, I understood the truth that if you do something wrong, you will be punished by the gods, and you have to pay a heavy price for it. The price, the Magonid family has reached this point today is the result of continuous repayment of debts! But-"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka's eyes were like blades piercing Okriton, and his voice was cold and stern: "In that war, you Han What role did the Norse faction play?! The generals Monte Adeno and Annobas who were highly recommended by you were all incompetent. Their repeated failures not only consumed a large amount of Carthage's war resources. , are also frequently undermining the confidence of the people of Carthage! When my uncle and brother were fighting hard in Sicily, not only did you not fully support them, but you used various means to reduce assistance to them and slander their achievements. !... If I hadn't known that you were all native Carthaginians, I would have suspected that you were agents of the Theonians!"
