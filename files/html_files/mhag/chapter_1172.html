   Chapter 1172 Pausanias and Tegea
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So even though Pausanias was expelled for crimes, the Tegeans still regarded him as an honored guest. In the next 10 years, Pausanias did not Living a decadent life, he worked hard to become a bridge of communication between Tegea and Sparta, and actively integrated into Tegea society. Not only did he become friends with many Tegea councilors, but he was also elected to the Tegea nobility. parliament.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, due to the long-term continuation of the Theban War in recent years, even Tegea, which is a close ally of Sparta, inevitably provides a large amount of military rations every year, and also sends citizens to assist in the battle, even with Pausang. Nias worked hard to bridge it, but the trend of more and more Tegeans dissatisfied with Sparta did not change, so after the Spartan army suffered a disastrous defeat at Leuctra, the Arcadians wanted to establish an alliance again , seeking to break away from Sparta. Many Tegeans were inspired by such a situation. In the end, the anti-Spartan faction gained the upper hand in the parliament, and Tegea joined the Arcadian League.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The pro-Spartan faction quietly told Sparta the news in time, and this was how "Sparta warned the Arcadians to cancel the alliance immediately, otherwise war will usher in."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Arcadian Alliance headed by Mandinia flatly refused. Although a conflict broke out in the city of Tegea, in the end Tegea decided to follow the alliance and fight against Sparta. Seeing that the cloud of war was about to envelope Tegea. Asia, the Tegeans began to panic, and Pausanias prepared to take this opportunity to persuade the Tegeans to return to the embrace of Sparta. As a result, the Theonians suddenly invaded Messenia, and the entire situation was changed. Big changes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Theonia... Pausanias vaguely remembers: It was a newly established city-state in Magna Graecia. After Phoebidas came back from his mission to Magna Graecia, he also said bad things about this city-state, which was criticized by many people. As a ridicule, Sparta, as the overlord of Greece, did not take that small colonial city-state seriously at that time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Pausanias lived in seclusion in Tegea, the news became even more obscure. Occasionally, rumors were heard, "The war between Theonia and Syracuse was won... The war between Theonia and Carthage, To win..." He only sighed at the time: "This city-state is quite warlike!" Then he threw it behind him and didn't take this city-state too seriously. After all, things in the Western Mediterranean were far away from Tegea. Inland city-states still seemed too far away, and Pausanias was more concerned with affairs in the Peloponnese.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But now the kingdom in the Western Mediterranean actually sent an army to attack Sparta across the sea, and hit Sparta's Achilles' heel as soon as it came. Messenia was captured, Sparta suffered serious losses, and then Arcadia The alliance formed an alliance with Theonia, and the anti-Spartan faction in the city of Tegea completely gained the upper hand... Pausanias saw it in his eyes and felt pain in his heart. He once had the idea of ​​leaving Tegea, but Where else can he go now that he is already senile?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   These days, he keeps his house closed. On the one hand, he is to prevent being attacked by the anti-Spartans, and on the other hand, he does not want to see a bad situation again and upset himself.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   That night, after dinner, Pausanias was taking a walk in the courtyard to eat. The servant came to him and reported: "Master, there is someone outside asking to see you."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Who?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "He said he was your old friend, but he dressed up to look like There is something mysterious."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Confused, Pausanias came to the door himself.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Two people stood outside the door: a slave supporting another hooded man.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What do you want from me?" Pausanias asked coldly, while widening his eyes to see the face of the hooded man clearly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The man said: "Pausanias, I haven't seen him for more than ten years, you are getting old!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Who are you?" The voice was both familiar and unfamiliar, and Pausanias couldn't remember who it was for the moment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The man suddenly lifted his hood, and Pausani Aston was startled: "Agesilaus, why are you here?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "If you shout any louder, my life will be over." ." Agesilaus reminded half-jokingly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pausanias immediately woke up and quickly looked at the street outside the door. Fortunately, there was no one. He quickly welcomed the two of them into the house, closed the door tightly, and then said in a deep voice: "Agesilaus, you are The king of Sparta, the commander-in-chief of the Spartan army, ignored the army during the war and actually took the risk to sneak in here. Do you think Tegea is still the same Tegea it was before? It is very dangerous here now! In case you are discovered, Being captured, what a blow this will cause to the Spartan army! Can they still defeat the Theonians!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pausanias looked distressed, and his words were full of reproaches, as if he was still the same A Spartan king.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus smiled: "Although you have left Sparta for more than 10 years, you are still a Spartan."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I don't have time to gossip with you now." Pausanias said seriously : "Hurry out of the city now! If the people who arranged for you to enter the city dare not help anymore, I will make arrangements for you."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus stopped his smile and looked at the old king with an extremely solemn look. Shen Sheng responded: "I infiltrated Tegea just to save Sparta! Only by letting Tegea be completely used by Sparta can we have a chance to defeat the Theonian army, otherwise Sparta will cease to exist. !"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pausanias was stunned, and then asked with concern: "Is the situation in Sparta very serious now?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Very serious!" Agesilaus immediately explained the difficulties and dangers facing the Spartan army. Say them one by one.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pausanias stood stunned for a long time, and when worry filled his face full of grooves, he sighed: "Now the anti-Spartan faction in Tegea has a clear upper hand. If Tegea is to It is difficult to become an ally of Sparta again in a short period of time!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "As long as we have your help, we can do it!" Agesilaus answered confidently, and then he revealed his plan in full.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing this, Pausanias had a gloomy expression on his face. Thinking of the upcoming disaster for the Tegeans with whom he had a good relationship, he couldn't help but said, "Isn't this too cruel?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "If it weren't so, If you do, the fate Sparta will face will be even more tragic than this!" Agesilaus said with a heavy tone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pausanias was silent for a moment, and then said resolutely: "You just wait here, I will contact all the Tegea members who are closest to Sparta and the most trustworthy..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pausanias Ass!" Agesilaus stopped him and said solemnly: "I believe that after we defeat the Theonian army, the Council of Elders, the Inspector and the people will forgive you for the mistakes you have made!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At that moment, the eyes of the former King of Sparta, who was over 70 years old, suddenly seemed to have tears in his eyes. He sniffed and said with emotion: "Agesilaus, you are getting old too! I didn't expect that Sparta would be like this today." Bada...will be saved by our two old guys who are about to die!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ………………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the siege of Mantinia was relieved, Dai The Onian army remained in the camp, because Crotokatax adopted the advice of Printoles.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   They had received news from Sekerian and learned that the First Fleet had begun patrolling the Aegean Sea, cutting off the main food transportation channel for the Spartan mercenaries.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Clotokatax was worried that the actions of the First Fleet would arouse the dissatisfaction of other Greek city-states, Printors was more concerned that the First Fleet's proactive attack would make the Spartan army It was in trouble, because Sparta's national power was seriously damaged at this time, and most of its former allies had defected. It was not like Theonia, which had a steady stream of fleets transporting supplies to Messenia every day. There was probably enough rations to maintain such a large army.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As long as the Theonian army cannot stand firm, the Spartan army will soon collapse on its own or be forced to take some risky military actions. By then, the Theonian army will be able to win at a smaller cost. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So when the mountain reconnaissance soldiers discovered that about six to seven thousand soldiers from Sparta were converging with the Spartan mercenaries in Tegea, Printors not only did not feel nervous, but he felt very relaxed. Because the addition of the Spartan army will undoubtedly lead to a tighter supply of military supplies, and at the same time, the defense in Sparta will inevitably become empty due to insufficient troops.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, he suggested to Crotocatacus:
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   1. Continue to build defensive measures in the camp to guard against the attack of the Spartan army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   2. Order Sekerian to continue trying to land on the coast of Spartan territory to put pressure on the Spartans.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   3. Send more reconnaissance cavalry and reconnaissance soldiers, expand the scope of reconnaissance to the north of Tegea, and try your best to destroy and cut off the possible food transportation channels of the Spartan army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax adopted them one by one, and then Printors persuaded the commanders of each legion to implement them accordingly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Half a day later, Clotokatax received another messenger from Thebes. The news from his mouth not only surprised Clotokatax, but also changed Printoles' mood. It's terrible: the priests of Delphi and Olympia, as well as the Corinthians, are running around, planning to form a Greek city-state alliance, and conspiring against Theonia!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Whether it was Clotokatax or Printors, from the day they set foot on the Peloponnese, everything went smoothly. Despite Davos's instructions, As well as Leoticides' warning before leaving, they still had the illusion that "they should be able to gradually complete the tasks assigned by King Davos." If it weren't for the reminder from the Thebans, they would never have thought that The arrival of the Theonian army will cause strong resistance in the Greek Holy Land and prepare to set off huge waves to submerge them.
