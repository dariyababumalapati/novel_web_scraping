   Chapter 1144 The Restless Xenophon
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was not entirely accidental that the expeditionary army of the Holy Kingdom of Theonia docked and camped in Ellis.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As an outlier in the Peloponnesian League, Ellis was already under Davos' consideration. What's more, the Ellis region and the Arcadia region are close to Messenia, and those who fled to these two regions There are many Messenians, and the seven or eight citizens of Ellis who sang just now were born in Messenia.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Previously, because of military confidentiality, the Theonians did not publicize it to the outside world. Now they need to let the people of the entire Greek world know that Theonia sent troops to the Peloponnese not only to fulfill the covenant, but also to help Messenia. People need to restore their country, and Ellis of the Path can help them do just that.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After singing a song, the relationship between Tisias and the Eleans was quickly drawn closer, and the Eleans also began to discuss some cooperation matters with him. After all, they were all ready to join forces with the Arcadians to fight against the Ticeans. Sparta is here, and now Theonia's army attacking Sparta is right in front of you. Isn't this a better opportunity for cooperation!

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ………………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At dusk of that day, due to the huge noise of the Theonian army landing on the coast, not only the people of Ellis received the news, but also spread quickly. To nearby city-states, such as Olympia and Pisa, or to the small city Triphilia (triphlia) not far east of Olympia, which originally belonged to Elis but was later forcibly taken away by Sparta.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In a village called Scillus under Trifilia, there is a large house, where the respected Persian expedition hero and the famous Athenian scholar Xenophon lives.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xenophon, who returned from the Persian expedition more than 20 years ago, was expelled when he returned to Athens. He had to lead mercenaries again and followed the Spartan King Agesilaus to conquer Asia Minor. He performed military exploits and was therefore punished by Agesilaus. Xenophon regarded him as a distinguished guest of Sparta and assigned him land here. Xenophon has lived here for nearly 20 years and has regarded it as his second hometown.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition to following the Spartan army to fight abroad, he usually spent more time in the quiet and peaceful village, concentrating on thinking and writing articles. Sometimes he took his children and slaves to the nearby forest to hunt and relax, and lived a very special life. In addition to the comfortable pastoral life, he also raised his own money to build the Temple of Arthenis near the village of Skilos and worshiped it every year. He hoped that this god could protect this area and keep it peaceful and tranquil.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tonight, as usual, he sat in his study, lit an oil lamp, and began to conceive of his new book "History of Greece". This was a new idea that he had come up with after the completion of "The Expedition" a few years ago. He wanted to continue writing the revision. He was very familiar with the series of events that occurred in mainland Greece after Cydides wrote the "History of the Peloponnesian War", many of which he had personally experienced.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just when he was concentrating on thinking and writing, a sudden shout broke the tranquility of the village, and it did not disappear quickly, but made the whole village boil.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xenophon had to put down his pen and walked out of the study. As soon as he walked into the yard, he ran into his eldest son. He said slightly panicked: "Father, I heard from the villagers that the army of Theonia is in love." Landing on the coast of Leith and preparing to attack inland!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Theonia declared war on Ellis?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   How can this be?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Theonia and Ellis have never had any contact, and there was no warning in advance. Why did the war suddenly break out?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
  ---
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   _ As far as I can see, the Theonian ships are docked on the beach, with no end as far as the eye can see..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xenophon's expression became serious. He thought about it and said to his son: "Go out and tell the villagers, just say it is I said, let them not panic. Even if the Theonian army really wants to attack the interior, it is still far away from us. We have enough time to prepare and let them go home to rest. Don't do it in the dark. Gathering a crowd and making noise can easily cause panic and accidents!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not long after his son went out, the noise gradually became quieter, which showed Xenophon's prestige in the village.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xenophon still had no desire to write at this time. He paced back and forth in the yard irritably, recalling the previous incident that "Sparta was going to end the peace agreement with Theonia early": he felt very much about it at the time. Uneasy, but it is a pity that people speak softly, and even Agesilaus's strong objections could not stop him.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Well now, not long after the agreement was suspended, Theonia's army set foot on the land of Ellis. How much impact will this have on the situation in Peloponnese and the entire Greek mainland?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xenophon had just been to Thurii, and he had a deeper understanding of the strength of the Kingdom of Theonia. He couldn't help but tremble when he thought that this terrible beast finally came out of the cage and pounced on the Greek mainland. , there was only one thought in his mind: rush to Sparta immediately, tell them about this, and let them quickly discuss a good way to put this giant beast back in the cage!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But...is there really a good way?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ...Xenophon looked up at the dark night sky, remembering the incomprehensible look on his smiling face when he met Davos before
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ... …………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the early morning of the second day, the Theonia crew pushed the ship away from the beach, the soldiers quickly boarded the ship, and the entire fleet continued to sail south.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing that the Theonians really left, the Ellis people breathed a sigh of relief, and they will be impatient to wait for the drastic changes in the south.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is one more person in this Theonian fleet, that is, Ionicus, an Elisian member of Messenian descent who had previously spoken to Tisias. He took the initiative to apply to join the army as a love interest. Lis was the liaison with the Theonian army and also served as a guide, so he was approved by Commander Leoticides and appeared on the flagship of the First Fleet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, he pointed to the coast in front of him on the left and said in a trembling voice: "After passing this headland, you will enter the waters of Messenia!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Don't be nervous, we have so many warships, Sparta's fleet I don't dare to attack at all." Tisias comforted him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I'm not nervous, but a little excited." Ionicus let out a long breath.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tisias looked at him, nodded empathetically, and said softly: "Me too."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, the lookout on the top of the main mast of the flagship shouted loudly: "The clipper ahead raised a yellow flag!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Standing there Sekerian, who was looking ahead at the bow of the ship, immediately said to the captain of the flagship: "Tell the First Squadron to maintain the formation, continue to move forward, and ignore it unless the other party launches an attack." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Yes!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reason why Sekerian dared to issue such an order was because he had already understood clearly that Sparta currently had no more than 40 warships, and more than half of them were from allies, which was not enough to pose a threat to the First Fleet.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Perhaps only the Athenian fleet in the entire Greek mainland could cheer up Sekerian a little.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What actually appeared in front of the 1st Fleet were two Spartan patrol ships. They originally just wanted to warn the Theonian fleet to stay away from the offshore route, but the 1st Fleet went straight forward without paying any attention. A warship was approaching in the wind and waves. The Spartan crew had already become frightened and quickly turned around and retreated south.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Compared with the army, the Spartan navy was inferior to the earth. Except for the victory of the Sheep Horse River under the leadership of Lysander in the past, it had no brilliant achievements. In recent years, it has been beaten to disgrace by the Athenian navy one after another. Morale is extremely low, and they dare not challenge the huge Theonia fleet at this moment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Soon no Spartan warships appeared nearby, and the entire Theonia fleet sailed southward along the coast smoothly. On the one hand, it was to more conveniently ensure the safety of troop transports and baggage ships. On the other hand, it was also Take a look at the situation on land.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But what the crew saw were more continuous mountains. Only near the coast, a stone tower could be seen every one or two miles.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ionicus said in a heavy tone: "This is a tower that the Spartans forced the Messenians to build, but its purpose was to monitor the Messenians and prevent them from escaping. In the Messenian territory There are also many such facilities in the north. The Spartans made the entire Messenia into a prison for the Messenians... I think back then my father and his nearly two hundred people could not stand the cruel oppression and oppression of the Spartans. Killing, desperately escaping Messenia, less than 15 people were able to escape to Ellis alive in the end..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Tisias heard this, he was silent for a while, secretly clenched his fists, and said with hatred: "Today We, Theonia, are here to break this cage, and such tragedies will never happen again!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two vented their resentment against Sparta to each other, and a voice intervened: "Why don't you see anyone in these towers?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ionicus turned around and saw Leoticides, the army commander of Theonia, and hurriedly explained: "There were people in the past, and each tower was garrisoned by at least 10 soldiers, but now... …The Spartans fought every year, and their citizens were killed and wounded every year. As a result, they didn't even have enough manpower to defend Laconia. How could there be any extra soldiers stationed in these towers!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ionicus showed gloating about his misfortune. The look on his face, that of Leoticides, seemed a bit strange.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then Ionicus said: "But there must be Spartan warriors garrisoning the city of Pylos in front, because it is an important Spartan town on the west coast of Messenia."
