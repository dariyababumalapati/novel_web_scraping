   Chapter 1095: What the Kingdom Senate Sees
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the early morning four days later, Haka and Hasdrubal, who had recovered from their cold and regained their energy, left the mansion after having breakfast together. One sat in a sedan chair and the other walked on the flat ground. Solid neighborhood road to the Senate House.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There were many people wearing black-striped white robes along the way. They were all obviously elders attending the meeting. They walked together in twos and threes and greeted each other with smiles. Familiar people gradually gathered together and showed interest. They talked animatedly about the topic to be discussed today. Some groups had already gathered more than 10 people before they even arrived at the square. Therefore, from time to time pedestrians gave way and greeted them, receiving friendly responses from them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka was a newcomer and was sitting in the sedan chair again. Although some senators cast curious glances from time to time, no one came up to ask.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since Hasdrubal called Thurii, except for a banquet at Davos Mansion, he has never appeared in public, and few people know him. It was not until he was approaching the Great Council Hall that there was only one person. Greeted Hasdrubal with joy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hasdrubal could not remember who the other party was.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I am Antioch of Mazara," the man said with a smile.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hasdrubal suddenly widened his eyes and stared at the other person's face. He remembered something and said angrily: "It's you! It was you who led the Mazarans to secretly open the city gate!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Brother, Just like His Majesty said at the banquet, 'No fight, no acquaintance'. The past has passed. Now we are all citizens of Theonia and colleagues working together. We should strengthen our exchanges!" Haka He poked his head out of the sedan and reminded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lord Haka is right!" Antioch said with a relieved smile: "We are all Phoenicians and outsiders from Thurii, and we should help each other! Of course, I am very happy to listen to Lord Haka. According to Lord Hasdrubal's instructions, I believe other Phoenician senators have the same idea."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hasdrubal hummed, looked away, and did not respond.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After attending the palace banquet and talking with Davos last night, Haka already felt confident, so he said calmly in the sedan chair: "Thank you, Lord Antioch, for your trust. I will try my best to live up to you." Trust!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Antiocha suddenly smiled, and soon he called several Phoenician elders from western Sicily and Sardinia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the other elders saw the Phoenician elders who were usually not taken seriously, gathered around a sedan, they more or less guessed the reason, and unconsciously looked at the sick new rotating chairman. point.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing the dome-like circular building in front of him, Hasdrubal couldn't help but feel a little nervous. Originally, he and Haka were going to enter through the side door because the distance was relatively close, but Antioch suggested: "Since Haka This is the first time for Ka and Hasdrubal to attend the Senate meeting. They should enter through the main entrance so as to show their presence."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even Hasdrubal, who had a grudge against him, had to admit that what he said was reasonable, so The group of people bypassed the senators who were queuing up to enter the side door and arrived at the front of the Great Council Hall.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There were also senators lining up to enter. Haka stopped the sedan chair and walked out with the help of his servants. He stood in front of the steps and looked at the Victory Square in front of him and the towering memorial column in the center. The statue of the Goddess of Victory at the top was standing in front of him. It was particularly dazzling under the light of the morning sun.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although it is still early in the morning, there are already many pedestrians in the square, including officials working in various departments near the square, vendors working in the shops beside the square, or people preparing to attend hearings at the High Court beside the square. Or people who just go for a walk to relax in the square, there are also some children chasing and playing in the square with their puppies. The patrol team in velvet clothes patrolling back and forth in the square does not stop them, but will knock them down with a smile. The children on the ground helped them up and dusted them off... It was a lively scene.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka looked at it for a while and sighed: "The Square of Victory is much bigger than the Square of Carthage!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hasdrubal wanted to say: "But the Square of Carthage is much more gorgeous than this square."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But then he heard Antiocha say: "It's really big! After that war, Thurii held a triumphal ceremony, and I watched it at the time. This square could accommodate nearly 40,000 soldiers, which is equivalent to 5 A legion, that scene was really shocking!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hasdrubal remained silent, but judging from his restless expression, he must be thinking about something.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Hey, what is this?" Haka pointed curiously at the protruding platforms on both sides of the steps: the two platforms are connected to the main entrance of the Grand Council Hall. There are fences built on the platforms, and bronze protrusions are welded to the stone walls of the platforms. But there are round shields inlaid between the protrusions, making the stone walls of the platform seem to be made of bronze, making it look a bit ferocious.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This is the external podium of the Senate. It was rebuilt three years ago. During major celebrations, important events, or the passage of important bills, His Majesty King Davos and the rotating presidents will deliver speeches to the people here." Antiochus looked at Hasdrubal, pointed to the bronze protrusions and said: "And this is the bronze ram of the warship...it was unloaded from the captured Carthaginian warship...and those bronze shields It was also the capture of the Theonian army in that war-"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Antiocha saw Hasdroba's face looking ugly, and quickly added: "But most of them came from Rome. His Majesty King Davos He once said, "The reason why the podium is designed like this is not to show off military exploits, but to remind the people and the elders that today's Theonia is hard-won. Everyone must always stay vigilant and remember that war will lead to death." , If you forget to fight, you will be in danger!'"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka savored these words carefully, then showed a look of admiration, and said: "His Majesty Davos is indeed wise. I believe that under his leadership, the Kingdom of Theonia will still be able to survive." Become more powerful!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hasdrubal finally couldn't help but said angrily: "If those idiots in the Carthage Senate also understood this truth, they wouldn't be what they are today!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ha !
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ka obviously didn't want to talk more in this regard. He looked at the senators in front of him who were looking here, and said softly: "Let's go, let's line up too."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Antioch immediately said: "Master Haka, you are on duty. Chairman, you can enter the venue directly!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Antiocha deliberately spoke loudly, and the surrounding senators heard his voice, and their eyes immediately focused on him, and they began to whisper.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The etiquette officer on duty at the main entrance quickly ran down the steps and said uncertainly: "Master Haka?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I am." Haka nodded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Then please follow me." After the etiquette officer finished speaking, he turned around and walked up.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka looked back at his brother.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Thankfully I didn't let you line up here, otherwise it would be a joke if you fainted. Go quickly." Hasdrubal waved his hand impatiently.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka slowly walked up the steps under the gaze of everyone, and then he saw a golden column standing in front of him, one person high, facing the main entrance of the Grand Council Hall. There were some words engraved on the column, and he walked Taking a closer look, it says in Greek: xx miles from Crotone, xx miles from Silitium, xx miles from Hadrumantum... and even xx miles from Sessi (southern Iberia) central town).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This is a milestone, which records the distance between Victory Square and all major towns in the kingdom." The ceremonial officer explained beside him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Well, milestone, very interesting." Haka patted the column lightly. He knew in his heart that Theonia was not Carthage. According to its unique political system, the numbers above actually meant Theonia more. The distance and area that the power can cover is amazing!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Sir, please sign your name here." Coming to the tall wooden door, the etiquette officer held a wooden board in one hand and a white pen in the other and said to Haka.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka saw the time marked on the top of the board and some names had been written on it. He wrote his own name without hesitation, and then asked curiously: "Does every senator participating in the meeting have to sign?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, so that we can know those elders who did not attend or were late, especially those elders who do not have administrative appointments and should attend the meeting. If they are absent multiple times within a month, they will be criticized and punished by the Oversight Council. If they do not attend for a long time, Those who do may even be deprived of their status as senators!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka nodded lightly, but thought in his mind: As senators of Theonia, he and Hasdrubal have never been to the Senate in the past few years. What should this be? How to calculate?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The ceremonial officer seemed to understand his thoughts and continued: "Before, you and Lord Hasdrubal guarded the southern region of Iberia for a long time, under special circumstances, but now that you have returned to Thurii, I hope you can abide by the order of the Senate in the future! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course!" Haka immediately responded solemnly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the signal of the etiquette officer, the guard gave way to the door.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka followed the etiquette officer in, then went up another stone staircase, and soon came to the second wooden door. Guards were also stationed here, and the senators who entered were being politely searched.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The etiquette officer turned back and said: "Sir, since there are often heated arguments in the venue, insults may be exchanged when excited, and there may even be minor conflicts... For the safety of the elders, this is a necessary inspection."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I understand." The frail Haka agreed with this. After accepting the soldiers' body search calmly, he followed the etiquette officer into the venue.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as he entered the gate, Haka's eyes were directly attracted to a large pure white chair that should be carved from ivory in the central open space of the venue. It was placed steadily on a stone platform about two meters high. The upper floor is covered with brown lion skin, and it stands proudly facing the countless wooden chairs surrounding it.
