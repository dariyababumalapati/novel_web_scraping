   Chapter 1103: Selection of Regional Chief Executive (7)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But there was no clue on Davos's calm face.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just when some senators were considering whether to support Torex, another person stood up: "The person I recommend is-Antrapolis!" There
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   was a lot of commotion in the venue, regardless of whether it was recommended or not. Both the person and the person being recommended surprised them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Antonios, the former governor of Dauni during the war, and the newly appointed administrator of the western region of Sicily. Although he was once denounced due to the Laodicean incident, he rose again very quickly and still has a huge influence in the political arena of the kingdom. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Antrapolis, a veteran who turned from the intelligence service to politics. It is precisely because of this special identity that many elders keep away from him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lord Antrapolis, in response to His Majesty's call, resolutely went to the Latium area..." Antonios' tone of voice was somewhat familiar, causing Lysias to subconsciously look at Davos again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "... After assisting Asistes to stabilize order in Rome, Lord Antrapolis resolutely asked His Majesty to serve as the administrator of Satnicum. What a brave act! You all should Knowing that there was a plague in Satnicum City during the war, Antrapolis bravely took up the task of rebuilding Satnicum City not even half a year after the incident, without any fear of the possibility of infection. The danger of plague. In the past 20 years of the kingdom, which other senator has done such a crazy but admirable thing! Only Antrapolis!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And 5 years later, under his governance , Satnicum was not only rebuilt, but also more prosperous than before! So I think Mr. Antrapolis is the most qualified to be the chief executive of Dauni District!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Antonios finished speaking emotionally, and the original discussion continued There was suddenly a moment of silence in the venue, and then Plessinas, the scepter priest of Hades, took the lead in applauding, and gradually the whole place burst into applause.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Antrapolis had to stand up humbly and salute all around to express his gratitude.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Antonios looked around at the applauding senators and sneered in his heart: Maybe some of you will think that the reason why I recommended Anterrapolis is because I got Anthrapolis when I conquered Syracuse. Polis's help, now I am returning his favor... You are wrong, I am just executing His Majesty's orders.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A bunch of fools, they really took His Majesty's words, "You will make the decision for this election, I will not interfere..." seriously. In fact, he has been controlling the entire election from morning to now, but he did not use the methods you are familiar with. It's just Mariji and Plesinas...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As he was thinking about it, Antonios couldn't help but look at Davos, but after coming into contact with Davos's deep gaze, he quickly moved away.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   To be honest, if he had admired Davos's commanding ability and long-term vision before, in recent years he has been completely overwhelmed by the terrifying political control of His Majesty the King.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And Antrapolis was thinking about what his brother Aristelas had quietly told him a few days ago: "You don't have to worry about no one supporting you during the election. Your Majesty will never forget those things." A person who has made great contributions to the kingdom in the most difficult times will never let these important positions be occupied by those who do not contribute at the critical moment and come to pick apples later..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   My brother is right, My chances of becoming Downey District Administrator are very good!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ...Antrapolis was ecstatic in his heart. He had decided to accept Antonio's love and completely erase the incident of "he slapped him in the face".
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Facts have proved that with the secret support of Davos, the election will go very smoothly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Anthrapolis was elected by a landslide.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When he had to stand up again and salute and thank the senators, he felt very emotional: from today on, he is no longer the newcomer who just entered the political arena and was despised by others, but an important minister who plays an important role in the kingdom!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to achieve the goal he had originally promised, he worked tirelessly and even took risks several times, and finally got what he wanted!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The next thing to be selected is the Pucetti region!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lord Ansitanos!" The name shouted by the etiquette officer surprised everyone and made them curious: this famous scholar and respected diplomat in the kingdom The minister usually focuses on foreign affairs and academic research, and rarely has close contact with other elders. Who would he recommend?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I recommend Apirosia." Ansitanos stood up, said something slowly, and then remained silent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reason why Apirosia became the leader of the Messapian elders was not only because he was the first to surrender to Theonia and thus was more reused, but also because he was indeed capable, decisive, good at judging the situation, and responsible for The senate's evaluation of his performance as a town administrator for several times was good or above, but more importantly, he also had a good son-in-law - Palace Clerk Henepolis.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Henipolis joined Theonia with a dowry (Laos), it stands to reason that his prospects for development in the kingdom's political arena should be very good. As a result, he chose the humble official position of palace secretary, and he was very successful. For several years, he didn't like to interact with other senators, except for his former subordinate Eliandos.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But no senator dared to look down upon him, because he was a confidant of King Davos, and it was said that he was someone who could joke with the majestic King sitting in the center of the venue.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Hernipolis did not give much help to his father-in-law, this relationship alone gave Apirosia some more prestige in the Senate. Except for the stubborn Pleculus, the other Mesa Pi Yuanlao is willing to take him as the leader.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The person who could ask Ansitanos to recommend Apelosia was naturally his student Henepolis.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Henepolis, who was sitting in the venue, felt Davos' gaze coming towards him, he shrugged helplessly and said to himself: If this damn old man hadn't talked about his wife, he would have been whispering in my ear every day. , it annoys me to death, and I don't want to do it!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You know, in order to invite Teacher Ansitanos, I promised him that I would collect a lot of precious historical materials for him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There are several elders competing for the chief executive of the Pucheti region, and they are not weak in strength. However, Apirosia's recommender is too special.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ansitanos does not form cliques, but he is a good man and has a high reputation. He is with the mercenary senators, Vespa, Hermon, Lysias, Thedorum and other senators who joined the kingdom very early. He has a good relationship, and everyone is naturally willing to give him face if there is no conflict of interest.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, Ansitanos can also influence a group of special senators - nicknamed "scholar senators" by the people of the kingdom, such as Mentotic Els, Matiklis, Helps, Stacey Kordas, Little Heraclides, etc., they are actually not too interested in the selection of the regional chief executive. If it were not because the meeting was too important and they were required to attend, some of them would probably not come.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sitting in the venue, most of them had no inclination. They all voted based on the recommender's introduction, the debate on the spot, and their personal likes and dislikes. Now one of them, Scholar Ansitanos, is also recommending, Of course they would vote for the person he recommended, so the final result was that Apirosia was elected.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thorex was a little envious of this. They were both representatives of the same race, and both had a son-in-law who was closely related to the king. Henepolis could obviously give his father-in-law more than Adoris. help.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And Adoris is a stubborn person, so he changed such a great surname.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It wasn't that Thorex didn't ask his daughter to ask Adoris for help, but Adoris refused to beg His Majesty the King and even scolded his wife.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The next region to be elected is Messape!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hearing this, Milon immediately became nervous, and then he heard the ceremonial officer shout: "Lord Lysias!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Milon was surprised: because he was cautious in advance When Lysias discussed with him, he had decided that other senators would nominate for both elections at the meeting, but now he has changed his mind and is ready to participate in person!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reason why Lysias changed his mind was that he found that the fierce competition for this election had exceeded his expectations, not to mention that Sipulos and Antaolis had personally stepped forward one after another. If he did not use his prestige to personally appear, Recommended, it is very likely that the boat will capsize in the gutter, causing Milon to lose the selection.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, his premonition was correct. Milon could see the future potential of the Messape region. The other senators were not fools either, including the Heracleian senator Triphias and the Trina senator Bromatos. , Aelia senator Latignes... became candidates. These senators all joined the kingdom at the same time as Milon, and they were all older, so the competition was fierce. In the end, Milon was elected, and he had to It is said that the personal selection of the rotating chairman Lysias played a big role.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Next, in the election of the chief executive of the Crotone region, Bulkos once again recommended Miksippus and finally succeeded. Of course, the Lucanian and Amendolara factions also contributed to this.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, Davos was disgusted with the practice of forming cliques and ostracizing other senators. However, Weisba and Stromboli, who had followed Davos for many years and knew the king well, did not dare to do it at all. It went too far. Each of them only recommended one person, and then it died down. Moreover, the people selected were all young and promising veterans, so Davos turned a blind eye.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When selecting the chief executive of the southern region of Magna Greece, the name of a senator recommended also attracted everyone's attention. He was also a relative of King Davos and the father-in-law of Princess Cynthia, Pariandorus. He served as the chief executive of the town for the same period. With only 5 years, he was indeed diligent and practical in his work, but he was far from as amazing as Feidun. He knew it in his heart, so after someone said his name, he stood up in a hurry. He first thanked the person for the recommendation, and then said: He is not There is no intention to run for office.
