   Chapter 1307 War Letter
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reason is simple: the Theonian army must firmly control the pontoon bridge on the Euphrates River to ensure the smooth flow of transportation roads.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the army began to build the camp, the soldiers discovered a problem: this area was a continuous plain, covered with some withered grass, and clusters of bushes and reeds could be seen from time to time, but there was not a single tree in sight.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Unable to make wooden fences, the soldiers had to dig more dirt to ram the walls.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, there are also things that make the soldiers happy. For example, the terrain here is unusually open, and the camps of each legion can be completely spread out, unlike in Canaan and Syria, where due to the narrow terrain, they had to huddle together with almost no maneuverability. space, not to mention Phoenicia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Another thing that excites the soldiers is that there are many animals living on the plains north of Taposakus City.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Wild donkeys, antelopes, bustards, and even ostriches forage in groups on this wide plain. Even when they see strangers from a distance, they don't panic and run away because their limbs or wings are good at running. Let them escape human pursuit.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But while the Theonian army was building camps, it sent out the Numibian light cavalry regiment, which was best at hunting on the plains. Thousands of Numibian light cavalry used tactics to round up wild donkeys and antelopes, using Bustards and ostriches were shot with bows and arrows, providing the soldiers with a large amount of fresh meat in just two days.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, the cooks in the supply camp also used fishing nets to catch many large sturgeons in the Euphrates River.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Donkey and mutton meat is nourishing, bustard meat is tender, and sturgeon is delicious. Only ostrich meat is rough.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the Theonian army left Egypt and fought all the way, the dried meat they originally reserved has long been eaten up. Especially after entering the inland, the daily food is drinking hot water and eating bread. The soldiers did not expect that it would turn into ruins. Eating such delicacies in the territory of Taposakus City not only made me tired, but also gave me energy to work.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Two days later, the Numibian cavalry who had culled all the animals near the camp had to move eastward in search of new prey.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   One of the cavalry even entered the territory of Nicephonia while chasing the wild donkeys. Then they were shocked to see the endless thick dust mist rolling towards them, and the entire sky was dimmed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Persian army is coming!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ... Before they could run back to the camp in panic to report the news, the scouts had already sent the information back to the king's tent in the camp.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While Davos ordered all legions to be on alert, he also asked the reconnaissance team to pay close attention to the movements of the Persian army and report back at any time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the afternoon, Davos received news again: The Persian army stopped advancing 20 miles away from the Theonia camp and began to camp for rest. At the same time, it sent a team of less than 10 envoys to meet Theonia. King of Nia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………………………………………………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Trebasus came to Dai under the "escort" of the Theonian cavalry. In front of the Theonia camp, he stopped and looked attentively: the Theonia camp in front of him was very simple, with only a long earth trench and an earth wall more than one meter high, which was completely incomparable to the camp in Syria. , but the defense of the camp can take shape within two days. The Theonians are indeed very good at building fortifications.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Trebasus was secretly glad that his army arrived in time, and at the same time, he was thinking in his mind how his army could capture this simple camp if the Theonian army still couldn't hold on.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He thought as he walked, and soon came to the gate of the camp.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is said to be a camp gate, but it is actually just a gap in the earthen wall. At the gap stood four fully armed palace guards and the clerk Henepolis.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Welcome, envoy of Persia." Henipolis said welcome, but there was no trace of enthusiasm on his face, instead he looked cold.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Trebassus showed a blank expression, which made Henepolis immediately realize that the other party could not understand Greek, and the palace secretary who was proficient in many languages ​​immediately repeated his words in Persian.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Only then did Trebasus understand. He raised his head and responded: "I came to meet your king on the order of your Majesty -" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty knows your intention and agrees to see you. Come with me." Henibo Reese interrupted him directly, waved his hand to follow him, turned around and walked back.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Trebasus's face twitched a few times, suppressing the unhappiness in his heart, and followed into the camp. He immediately calmed down and began to observe the surroundings carefully.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As far as he could see, the camp seemed a bit chaotic: the tents were not only set up crookedly, but also arranged very irregularly, causing the passages between the tents to twist and turn; many soldiers in single clothes were wandering between the tents, and some Some of them were even shirtless, lying on their backs by the passage to bask in the sun. Even if they saw their arrival, they did not move. Only after Henepolis scolded them did they move away reluctantly...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Trebasus could clearly understand I heard them grunting: "I've been building the camp these past few days, and I'm exhausted! I can finally lie down and rest for a while, and it's so annoying to bother me!" "Is
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   n't it just for your majesty? How dare you yell at me, a small official writing documents! He made me angry, so I slapped him to the ground!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It's either marching or building camps, it's endless! We have gained enough wealth. Why are you still going east? You can just retreat!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 ---
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Yes, Trebassus understands Greek, but he pretends not to understand, hoping to use this to find out more about the Theonia camp. Realistically, he saw that the Theonian official who was leading the way became more and more ugly, but he had to endure it. In the end, he simply stopped ordering the casual soldiers to give way, which also made their group's progress The speed slows down.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Trebasus remained silent, but deliberately put on an impatient look on his face.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After finally passing through a camp, there was a noise in front of them: dozens of soldiers gathered together, first they cursed, and then they actually started to fight.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Soon armed patrols arrived and dispersed them with sticks.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What happened?" Trebasus asked curiously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Henipolis concealed the embarrassment on his face and said perfunctorily: "Nothing, nothing, uh... A group of soldiers were very energetic and had a wrestling match in private, but it turned out to be too much..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Trebasus did not ask any more questions, but in fact, he heard clearly just now: the two groups of soldiers fought over the captured prey.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Finally arriving in front of the Theonian army's tent, Trebasus heard the quarrel coming from the tent. He listened carefully: It seemed like they were arguing about whether to continue marching eastward?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, bring the Persian envoy!" Henipolis shouted, and the silence quickly returned to the tent. A strong and deep voice came out: "Bring him in!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Trebassus walked into the tent. What came into view were twenty or thirty Theonian generals wearing armor and helmets with bright tassels. They turned to look at the tent with fierce eyes, and in the center of the tent sat the same people. Wearing armor and a crown, the old man looked solemn and majestic.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Trebasus took two steps forward, bowed slightly, and spoke loudly with his head held high: "Masters of Bosnia, Mesopotamia, Armenia, Asia Minor, Egypt, Arabia, India... and other places, The King of Kings, the son of Ahura Mazda, the great King Artaxerxes sent me to bring you, the noble King of Theonia, a personal letter from him, and I look forward to your reply. !"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Trebasus finished speaking, Henepolis translated it again in Greek.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos laughed: "What you just said is wrong. Your king is too self-deceiving. He should know that he is no longer the master of Egypt, and now Canaan, Phoenicia, Syria, and most of Asia Minor have It does not belong to Persia."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After listening to Henepolis's translation, Trebassus responded calmly: "The war has just begun, and it is still uncertain who will lose and who will win. Maybe King Artaxerxes will still be there in the end. Will become the master of Theonia!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After listening to the translation, Davos's face changed slightly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before he could speak, a general suddenly stood up next to him and cursed angrily: "Damn Persians, how dare you come here and talk nonsense, you are not afraid that I will cut off your head and play it as a ball!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos Waving his hand: "Sit down, Matonis! It is tradition that the two armies will not harm the messenger when fighting. Don't let the Persians laugh at us Theonians for our lack of etiquette."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Matonis did not listen and still looked at Trebasu Si glared.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Sit down quickly!" Davos looked a little ugly and shouted several times before Matonis sat down angrily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This situation was seen by Trebasus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a moment, Davos, who had calmed down, said not to be outdone: "Yes, the war has just begun, and the outcome is still uncertain. Maybe in the end the whole of Persia will be owned by Theonia! - Artaxerxes Where is the letter you wrote to me?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Trebasus immediately took out the letter from his arms.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos looked around, and then said with a disdainful smile: "I won't read the letter. Why don't you read it out loud and let us all listen. Facing our powerful elite army, the man who often fights What would the defeated Persian king say?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The generals burst into laughter.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Trebasus listened to the translation and did not retort. The ferocious gaze of the Theonian general just now still made him a little frightened. In order to avoid trouble, he unfolded the letter as if he had not heard anything, and read aloud with a serious expression: " The Lord of the Eastern Mediterranean and the King of Kings to the King of Theonia in the Western Mediterranean. Theonia was just a small country a few decades ago, but it was brave, ruthless and expansionist. It never stopped invading other countries and relied on Robbery, annexation, strengthening itself, threats and inducements to control other countries, making the surrounding city-states in danger.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Persia has always been responsible for maintaining order in the Mediterranean, and has long been determined to teach Theonia a lesson and return peace to the Mediterranean. Unexpectedly Theonia brazenly invaded my Persian territory, occupied my territory, and killed my people. The people were terrified and the gods were angry! Today, I led a million revenge troops to open a battlefield east of the territory of Taposakus to fight with you. A decisive battle in Theonia to completely resolve the hatred between the two countries - do you dare to come?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Trebasus emphasized his tone and finished the last sentence word for word.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
