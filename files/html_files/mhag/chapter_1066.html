   Chapter 1066: The Debate on Immigration
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Moreover, if these dissatisfied foreigners are gathered together, formed into an army, and stationed at the dangerous border, with no hope for a long time, I am afraid it will breed even greater troubles.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reason why the Roman Empire in its previous life was able to allow soldiers to serve for more than 20 years was because most of the soldiers they recruited were Roman citizens.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Perhaps at this stage, the number of years given by Sipulos is more appropriate... Davos tapped his fingers on the back of the chair, thinking silently.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Unlike Davos's calmness, the ministers were a little surprised by Sipulos' suggestion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Rafias first asked: "Lord Sipulos, do you mean to cancel our 20-year-old immigration law and replace it with this new law that 'must serve at the border to become a citizen of the kingdom'?!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Yes Yes, Lord Laphias." Sipulos replied calmly: "If a new immigration law is promulgated and the old immigration law is still in effect, then the vast majority of foreign free people will definitely choose the old law, and If you are unwilling to serve, after all, it is relatively easy and easy to achieve, then the promulgation of this new law is meaningless." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But if the old law is abolished and the new law you mentioned is implemented, the free citizens who are willing to join the kingdom If they go to serve, the labor force in the kingdom will inevitably be greatly reduced... We all know that after the war with Carthage, the land of the kingdom more than doubled, and there is still a lot of land left that has not been distributed, and it is urgently needed A large amount of labor, and suddenly changing the original law at this time will inevitably seriously affect the development of the kingdom!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What's more, those who want to be recruited into the army must be young and strong free people, so for those free people who are older and have special skills Or what about unmarried women and children who have lost their parents? No matter how hard they try, will they never be able to become citizens of Theonia? Are we going to give up on the long-term efforts that have been made since the establishment of the kingdom and throughout the Mediterranean Greece? A belief gradually formed among the free people - "Burkos took a deep breath and said loudly: "Theonia is a kingdom of fairness and fraternity. Anyone, no matter what origin, what race, whether male, female, old or young, as long as he If you yearn for this country and work hard for it, you can become a citizen of this country!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Burkos's last few words were so powerful that even Davos was a little moved after hearing them, which of course also aroused a discussion among the ministers. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sipulos obviously did not consider this issue, so he was lost in thought and failed to respond immediately.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Atalis said: "Lord Burkos, what you just said was very good. But I would like to ask, are there only Athenian citizens in Athens?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Burkos felt a little confused by this irrelevant question, but he still answered seriously. : "Of course not. There are many foreigners in Athens, and the number even exceeds the citizens of Athens." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So do these free people stay in Athens for a long time to become Athenian citizens?" Antaolis then asked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This time, Bulcos somewhat understood what Antaoris meant, but he still answered the well-known fact frankly: "Of course not, Athens does not allow outsiders to become citizens. In fact, it is not only Athens, but also Thebes, Corinth, Athenaeum, etc. Goss, Sparta...almost all Greek city-states will not easily absorb outsiders to become city-state citizens, but this is also the reason why our Theonia can attract a large number of Greek free people from the Eastern Mediterranean to come here every year."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " But there are still a large number of free people in Athens, Corinth, Argos, Thebes, and even Sparta. The reason why they stay in these city-states is just for a better survival, even if they do not have any political rights. , life safety is not absolutely guaranteed (Greek city-states do not have any laws to specifically protect free people), they can only engage in various menial jobs in the city-state, and even have to be recruited to serve as auxiliary soldiers or sailors in the event of war. The living environment is very bad!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Antaoris lamented with a heavy expression, and then the volume rose, and he said confidently: "But what about the free people living in our kingdom? Just specially formulated to protect them. There are several laws on rights, and they have been revised many times! They can rent public land in the kingdom relatively easily, and the tax rate they pay is not very high. They can also serve as the lowest level public officials in the kingdom. In our opinion Although they are humble, they still have a lot of influence on ordinary people. Although we have recruited them during the war, they are rarely allowed to directly participate in the battle, and in the event of an accidental death, the family will receive a considerable amount of benefits. Pensions...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although there is still a big gap compared with the rights obtained by citizens, compared with the free people in mainland Greece, their lives are already very good. Not to mention the Kingdom of Theonia Strong and prosperous, with peace and tranquility in the territory, unlike the Greek city-states in the east that were weak and often encountered wars that led to the destruction of their homes. So even if the old immigration laws are cancelled, many foreigners cannot become citizens of Deolia, I think They will still come here to settle, because the Kingdom of Theonia is indeed the most suitable place for them to survive!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lord Antaoris is right!" Rotating Chairman Hermon (the third year after the end of the Western Mediterranean War) , affected by the death of Cornelus, Vespa, who was almost 70 years old, took the initiative to ask Davos to resign as chairman, and begged not to participate in Senate meetings anymore, but to take good care of himself at home. Davos agreed. accepted his request and proposed that the Senate elect Hermon to take over his position) took over: "In the past, Theonia needed a large number of new people to quickly enrich its national strength and cope with the dangerous environment around it, so it gave foreigners The treatment of free people is very good, but as your Majesty just said, as time and situations change, old laws and regulations should be adapted to new needs and should be changed accordingly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Today, the kingdom is so powerful that any city-state or country Not only do they not dare to challenge us, but they will actively seek to ally with us. In such a relatively safe surrounding environment, do we really need to be so eager to transform these foreign free people into Kingdom citizens?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is indeed a lot of vacant land in the kingdom. In addition to considering those free people who want to become citizens of the kingdom, can't we focus on our own people!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The kingdom's current population is more than 3 million. How many adult citizens are there every year?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hermon asked this question to the new Minister of Education, Monmentotique Els. Why did he ask him instead of the Minister of Household Registration, Rafael? Because Hermon believed: In Theonia Twenty years after its founding, almost all citizens' children attend urban schools, so the secretary of state, who oversees all schools, should have a better say.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But Mentotic Els said: "I don't know that every year How many adult citizens are there in the Kingdom? Because many students have graduated from school before they are minors. I can only tell you that the number of people who graduated last year was 23,571.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Raphias interjected: "The number of adult citizens in the kingdom is about 20,000 every year, but the number has increased sharply in the past few years. This is because after the last war, the kingdom merged into several regions and had more people. Large population..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hermon expressed his gratitude to the two, and then asked the Minister of Household Registration: "Lord Rafias, as far as you know, among all the citizen families in the kingdom, how many families have more than two boys?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This question is a bit difficult. Living in Laphias, he thought for a while and then said uncertainly: "I'm afraid it's at least 70%. Due to the blessing of Hades and the high level of our kingdom's medical skills, with your majesty's strong support, Lord Helps led the doctors to invest a lot of energy in fertility and early childhood treatment and made great progress. The success rate of pregnant women's delivery has been greatly improved, and the mortality rate of infants after birth has also been greatly reduced. Nowadays, most families have more than two children, and for old citizens, almost every family has children who have successfully grown up..." When Laphias said this, he turned to Medical Minister Helps and nodded. Express thankfulness.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "So, how many foreign free citizens will the kingdom receive every year as formal citizens?" Hermon asked again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This number is uncertain. In the years before the last war, because there was very little remaining land, according to the requirements of His Majesty and the Senate, the Ministry of Agriculture and our Department of Household Registration deliberately controlled it. In addition, the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean was stable, at least There are only more than 2,000 people a year... In recent years, the kingdom is in urgent need of labor, and the war in mainland Greece has become more and more intense, so there are at least more than 10,000 people every year..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone, you have heard it, the kingdom has 2 people every year There are about 10,000 adult citizens. This number is almost the same as the number of citizens of a traditional Greek power. Although the Ministry of Household Registration has allocated land to them in recent years, this is only a temporary measure to occupy the vacant land more quickly. Land. In fact, the kingdom does not have a special decree that requires the distribution of land to adult citizens, because according to our accustomed thinking, they will inherit the property left by their fathers in the future.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But the current situation in the kingdom is that most citizens They all have several sons. According to the kingdom's decree that "the inheritance is freely distributed by the original owner according to his own wishes," most citizens will probably choose to divide their property equally among several children. Then the land area owned by each child may even be It will be lower than the original land allocated to the citizens by the kingdom. These children who were born and grew up in the kingdom received the education of the kingdom from an early age, abide by the laws of the kingdom, and are familiar with everything about the kingdom. They love and are loyal to the kingdom. However, What they received after becoming citizens was not as much as these foreign free people became official citizens! Guys, do you think this is fair?!"
