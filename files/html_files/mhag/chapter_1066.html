   Chapter 1066 The Debate on Immigration
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Furthermore, if these dissatisfied foreigners are gathered together, formed into an army, and stationed on the dangerous border, without hope for a long time, it may lead to greater troubles. The reason why the Roman Empire in its previous life was able to allow soldiers to serve for more than 20 years was because most of the soldiers they recruited were Roman citizens.

 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Perhaps at this stage, the number of years given by Sipulos is more appropriate... Davos tapped the back of the chair with his fingers, thinking silently.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Different from Davos's calmness, the ministers were a little surprised by Sipulos's suggestion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Laphias first asked: "Lord Sipulos, do you mean to cancel our 20-year-old immigration law and replace it with this new law that 'you must serve at the border to become a citizen of the kingdom'?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Lord Laphias." Sipulos replied calmly: "If a new immigration law is promulgated and the old immigration law is still in effect, then the vast majority of foreign free people will definitely choose the old law. , and are unwilling to serve, after all, it is relatively easy and easy to achieve, so the promulgation of this new law is meaningless."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "But if the old law is abolished and the new law you mentioned is implemented, and all free people who are willing to join the kingdom go to serve, then the labor force in the kingdom will inevitably be greatly reduced... We all know that the war with Carthage After that, the land of the kingdom more than doubled, and now there is still a lot of land left that has not been distributed, and a lot of labor is urgently needed. At this time, a sudden change in the original decree will inevitably seriously affect the development of the kingdom!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What's more, those who want to be recruited into the army must be young and strong freedmen. So what about those freedmen who are older and have special skills, or unmarried women, or children who have lost their parents? Is it true that no matter how hard they try, they will never be able to become citizens of Theonia? Do we have to give up a belief that has gradually formed among Greek free people throughout the Mediterranean after long-term efforts since the establishment of the kingdom?" Burkos took a deep breath and said loudly: "Theonia is a kingdom of fairness and fraternity. , no matter what origin, what race, whether male, female, old or young, as long as he yearns for this country and works hard for it, he can become a citizen of this country! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The last few words of Burkos were so powerful that even Davos was a little moved after hearing them. Of course, they also aroused a discussion among the ministers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sipulos obviously did not consider this issue, so he was lost in thought and failed to respond immediately.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Atalis said: "Lord Burkos, you just said it very well. But I would like to ask, are there only Athenian citizens in Athens?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Burkos felt a little confused by this irrelevant question, but still answered seriously: "Of course not, there are many foreigners in Athens, and the number even exceeds the citizens of Athens."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "So these free people have been staying in Athens for a long time to become Athenian citizens?” Antaolis then asked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This time, Bulcos somewhat understood what Antaoris meant, but he still answered the well-known fact frankly: "Of course not, Athens does not allow outsiders to become citizens. In fact, it is not only Athens, but also Thebes, Corinth, Athenaeum, etc. Goss, Sparta...almost all Greek city-states will not easily absorb outsiders to become city-state citizens, but this is also the reason why our Theonia can attract a large number of Greek free people from the Eastern Mediterranean to come here every year."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "But there are still a large number of free people in Athens, Corinth, Argos, Thebes, and even Sparta. The reason why they stay in these city-states is just for a better survival, even if there is no political Their rights and life safety were not absolutely guaranteed (Greek city-states did not have any laws to specifically protect free people), and they could only engage in various menial jobs within the city-state. They even had to be recruited as auxiliary soldiers or sailors in the event of war. , the living environment is very bad!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Antaoris lamented with a heavy expression, then his voice rose, and he said confidently: "But what about the free people living in our kingdom? There are several laws specifically formulated to protect some of their rights. , and has been modified many times! They can rent public land in the kingdom relatively easily, and the tax rate they pay is not very high. They can also serve as public officials at the lowest level of the kingdom, which in our opinion is low-level, but for ordinary people They still have considerable influence on the people. Although we have recruited them during the war, they are rarely allowed to directly participate in battles, and in the event of an accidental death, the family will receive a considerable pension...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although there is still a big gap compared with the rights obtained by citizens, compared with the free people in mainland Greece, their lives are already very good. What's more, the Kingdom of Theonia is strong and prosperous, and the territory is peaceful and peaceful, unlike the Greek city-states in the east that are weak and often encounter wars that cause their homes to be destroyed. So even if the old immigration laws are cancelled, which prevents many foreigners from becoming citizens of Dioria, I think they will still come to settle here, because the Kingdom of Dioria is indeed the most suitable place for them to survive! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lord Antaoris is right!" Rotating Chairman Hermon (in the third year after the end of the Western Mediterranean War, affected by the death of Cornelus, Weisba, who was almost 70 years old, took the initiative to ask Diver Si requested to resign from the position of rotating chairman, and begged not to participate in Senate meetings anymore, but to take care of his old age at home. Davos agreed to his request and proposed that the Senate elect Hermon to replace him) took over: " In the past, Theonia needed a large number of new people to quickly enrich its national strength and cope with the dangerous environment around it, so the treatment given to foreign free people was very good. However, as your Majesty just said, as time and the situation change, Old laws and regulations should be adapted to new needs and should be changed accordingly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now that the kingdom is so powerful, any city-state or country not only dares not challenge us, but will actively seek to form an alliance with us. In such a relatively safe surrounding environment, do we really need to be so eager to transform these foreign free people into Kingdom citizens? ! There is indeed a lot of vacant land in the kingdom. In addition to considering those free people who want to become citizens of the kingdom, can't we focus on our own people! The current population of the kingdom is more than 3 million. How many adult citizens are there every year? "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hermon asked this question to the newly appointed Minister of Education, Monmentotique Els. Why ask him instead of asking the Minister of Household Registration, Rafael? Because Hermon believes that 20 years after the establishment of Theonia, almost all citizens' children will enter various city schools to study, so the Secretary of Education in charge of all schools should have a more say in this.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, Mentotic Els said: "I don't know how many citizens of the kingdom come of age every year, because many students have graduated from school before they are minors. I can only tell you that the number of graduates last year was 23,571 people."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Rafias interjected: "The number of adult citizens in the kingdom is about 20,000 every year, but the number has increased sharply in recent years. This is because after the last war, the kingdom merged into several regions and has more population……"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hemon expressed his gratitude to the two men, and then asked the household registration minister: "Lord Rafias, as far as you know, among all the citizen families in the kingdom, how many families have more than two boys?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This question was a bit difficult for Rafias. He thought for a while and then said uncertainly: "I'm afraid it's at least 70%. Due to the blessing of Hades and the high level of our kingdom's medical skills, under your majesty's With the strong support of the doctor, Mr. Helps led the doctors to invest a lot of energy in fertility and infant treatment and made great progress, which greatly improved the success rate of pregnant women's delivery and reduced the number of babies who died after birth. The rate has also been greatly reduced. Now most families have more than two children, and for old citizens, almost every family has children who have successfully grown up..." At this point, Rafias turned to the Minister of Medical Affairs Helps nodded in thanks.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "So, how many foreign freemen will the kingdom receive as full citizens every year?” Hermon asked again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This number is uncertain. In the years before the last war, because there was very little remaining land, according to the requirements of His Majesty and the Senate, the Ministry of Agriculture and our Department of Household Registration deliberately controlled it. In addition, the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean was stable, at least There are only more than 2,000 people a year... In recent years, the kingdom is in urgent need of labor, and the war in Greece has become more and more intense, so there are at least 10,000 people every year..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Everyone, you have all heard that the kingdom has about 20,000 adult citizens every year. This number is almost the same as the number of citizens of a traditional Greek power. Although the Ministry of Household Registration has also allocated land to them in recent years, this is just The temporary measure is to occupy the vacant land more quickly. In fact, the kingdom does not have a special decree that requires the distribution of land to adult citizens, because according to our accustomed thinking, they will all inherit what their fathers left in the future. the property of.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But the current situation in the kingdom is that most citizens have several sons. According to the kingdom's decree that "the inheritance is freely distributed by the original owners according to their own wishes," most citizens will probably choose to divide their property equally among several children. Then the area of ​​land owned by each child may even be lower than the original allotment of the kingdom to the citizens. These children who were born and grew up in the kingdom have received education from the kingdom since childhood, abide by the laws of the kingdom, and are familiar with everything about the kingdom. They love and are loyal to the kingdom. However, what they get after becoming citizens is not as good as these foreign freedoms. There are so many formal citizens who have changed from citizen to citizen! Guys, do you think this is fair? ! "
