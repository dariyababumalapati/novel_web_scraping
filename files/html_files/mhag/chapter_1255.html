   At the opening ceremony of Chapter 1255,
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lycomedes of the Theonian royal family sat down and sighed: "It is indeed quite different! On the first day of the sports games held in our mainland Greece, all Let the athletes and spectators gather in front of the temple and offer sacrifices to the gods together with the priests. Then the athletes stand in front of the altar, under the guidance of the priests, and swear in the name of the gods... But now we are sitting in the arena, Waiting for the start of the sports games!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, this is exactly what I am confused about." Pelopidas asked curiously: "Lycomedes, do you know what the Theonians will do next? ?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I just met Tisias, the chief general of Messenia, on the way here, and I asked him the same question. He didn't know, so how could I know." Lycomedes said with a smile: " I don't know if it's just right, so any next move by Theonia will be a surprise!" As

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   soon as his words fell, the entire arena suddenly boiled with cheers and shouts.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two people who were talking didn't know what was going on. Ipamironda, who had been silently observing the surroundings, loudly said in their ears: "King Davos is here!" The

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   royal stand is not far to their right. , is a marble platform 20 meters long and 5 meters high, with a gold-inlaid iron railing, a blue and white curtain above it, and majestic palace guards guarding it all around.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, Davos took the two princesses Christoya, Agnes, and all the children onto the stand.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The sharp-eyed people of Theonia immediately discovered this situation, and cheered and paid tribute to their beloved king and princess.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos, wearing a gold crown and a gorgeous black gold-embellished bolton, smiled and raised his right hand, swinging it slightly, to salute the audience.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The cheers in the arena were even louder.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Suddenly, the audience opposite the royal stand stood up, raised their arms above their heads, and then sat down again, followed by the audience on their right doing the same action...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Human wave! Human wave! I want it too Play!" Crotokatax's second son, 6-year-old Crimides, ran forward excitedly. Krystoya quickly grabbed him and said softly: "Kerry, don't worry, it will take a while. Let's play together."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sure enough, when the crowd spread to the royal stand, Davos and his family raised their hands, stood up from the soft sofa, and then sat down again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Despite the personal participation of royal family members, the wave of people became intermittent due to the large number of non-Theonian spectators.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Theonia audience continued patiently, the second round, the third round... Finally, all the spectators were mobilized, and the entire arena stands rose and fell like a rolling wave, which was truly spectacular.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the wave of people ended, Pelopidas still had more to say, and kept saying: "Not bad! This surprise is very good!!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the VIPs were discussing the wave of people in the audience, Davos was already sitting on his back. Sitting on the couch, he smiled and said to Christoya: "Judging from the wave of people just now, at least 2/5 of the audience are not Theonians. It seems that the Turiyi City Hall is serious about its implementation. The decision of the palace."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Kristoya rolled her eyes at him: "Not only the city hall, but also our chamber of commerce has also made great efforts!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Don't worry, I haven't finished speaking yet, and I must give you praise. ." Davos salivated and went to touch Crystal's hand, but she slapped her hard and warned: "This is a public place, don't mess around, it's not good for people to see it!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos Si said sternly: "What's wrong with this? Showing our love to the people is to remind them to respect their marriages and love their wives! Agnes, are you right?!" As he said, he also He took the opportunity to hold Agnes's hand.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agnes smiled slightly, but tried hard to push her hand back, but she did not break free, so she had to let her husband touch her.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Eunice, who was sitting in the back, made a face and whispered to her brothers and sisters: "Father is so shameless."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Eunice, what are you talking about!" Davos did not look back, but seemed to see it with his own eyes. Seeing what he saw, he shouted.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Ah...it's nothing. I was telling my sister-in-law that the human sex just now was very fun." Eunice quickly blinked at Dido next to her: "Really, sister-in-law?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dido suppressed her laughter: "Yes."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " Telling lies with your eyes open, your daughter is just like you!" Kristoya scolded with a smile.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos coughed a few times: "Who else can my daughter be like if she doesn't look like me? Eunice, I give you a task to tell the front that the opening ceremony can begin. Don't keep the audience waiting." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This way. It should be up to the eldest brother to inform you of the occasion." Eunice said hesitantly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But Clotokatax understood what Davos meant and said with a smile: "Eunice, you are the most popular royal member in this arena. Who will go if you don't go? Besides, your appearance will give those people It was the first time for a non-Theonian woman to sit in the auditorium of a sports meeting with great encouragement."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing this, Eunice stood up and said naughtily: "Father, I'll go then, Don't be jealous that I'm more popular than you then!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "No matter how big or small, go, go, go!" Davos looked impatient, but he couldn't help but joked: "Arex , what's the matter with you, you didn't take good care of your wife!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before Alex could respond, Eunice's almond-shaped eyes widened: "How dare he?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Aviya finally couldn't help but laugh out loud. Voice.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Eunice walked out of the curtain with an elegant gesture and walked to the front of the royal stand. As expected, even more enthusiastic cheers rang out from around her.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the main arena of Hades, Eunice is more popular with the audience than King Davos, and this is not a lie.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because Eunice, who loves sports among the royal family members, will go to this arena to watch rugby and football games whenever she has free time, cheering for the players with the audience, and the Kristoya Chamber of Commerce once took the lead in her name. Donated money for the renovation of the Hades main arena, and on several occasions replaced the busy Davos and Clotokatax to present awards to the championship-winning rugby and football teams, so there were many spectators Both players and players call her the "goddess of the arena."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Among the enthusiastic and cheering audience, there were indeed a very small number of women from the Greek city-states. More than half of them were the wives of ordinary civilians. Due to their family background, they had to show up in the market to buy and sell goods or plant farmland. Therefore, at home, The status and power are much greater than those of women in noble families, but even so, they cannot go to the venues of various sports games to watch the exciting competitions. The Theonian Games gave them this opportunity, so they came with trepidation, And Princess Theonia, standing so eye-catchingly in the royal stands, undoubtedly gave them the greatest encouragement.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There were also a very small number of Greek girls in the audience. They were brought to watch the game by their businessman fathers. Their purpose was to catch a rich husband and help them develop business in the Kingdom of Theonia in the future. These girls had just sat down. When he was in the audience, he acted very reserved, lowering his head and not daring to look around. However, when he saw the Theonian women nearby shouting and shouting freely, he gradually relaxed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Next to the royal stand was a smaller platform, on which sat five hosts of the arena. After receiving Eunice's order, the leader immediately raised a red flag and waved it in the air. , after the Theonian audience saw it, they not only stopped making noise themselves, but also persuaded the audience next to them to stay quiet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the entire arena became quieter, the five hosts picked up the microphones wrapped in copper sheets and said in unison with the loud voices and tacit understanding they had gained from hosting competitions for many years: "Everyone, audience, welcome to the Arena. Dis Main Arena! On the order of the great King Davos, we announce that the Theonian Games have officially begun!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   First of all, please invite the band to enter!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As the host's voice sounded, it led to the entrance of the arena. The gate opened, and nearly a hundred musicians holding various musical instruments lined up in neat columns, entered the arena, and marched along the edge of the track, playing "March" as they marched.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Their entrance was immediately greeted with warm applause from the audience, and the citizens of Theonia among them also clapped their hands and hummed along with this familiar melody, and the entire stadium became lively again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just as the band entered the stage, two distinguished guests were also welcomed to the King's Stand: Plato and Xenophon.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the surrender of Athens and the end of the Greek War, Plato refused Davos's request to stay, returned to Athens, and continued to manage his Akademi Academy. Not only was he no longer criticized by the Athenian people, but the General Executive Committee also asked him from time to time. Asked about the Kingdom of Theonia, he also occasionally wrote to Davos to communicate political issues, and has always kept in touch with Davos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Sparta was conquered, Davos wrote several times inviting Xenophon to teach at the Theonian Academy of Literature, but he refused on the grounds that he was "working hard on his writing and didn't want to be disturbed." He has been living in seclusion in the Peloponnese.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But this time Davos invited them in the name of a sports meeting, but they came happily. The reason is simple: they are not only fans of sports competitions, but also participants. Plato was a good wrestler when he was young, and Xeno Fin was good at racing when he was young. Later, after he settled in Peloponnese, because it was very close to Olympia, the competition venues of the Olympian Games were not missed, and he also participated in horse racing.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, Greece in this era advocated strength and beauty, so Greek celebrities all liked sports and competitions. Otherwise, no matter how knowledgeable they were, if they were weak, they would be despised by the people.
