   Chapter 1099: Selection of the Regional Chief Executive (3)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There are many Nuragi people in the inland mountainous area, so it is obviously more attractive than the Corsica region. Four more elders were recommended one after another, but in the end the candidate was elected The result was that Flocrates received more than 60% of the votes and was elected with an absolute advantage.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing this, Haka understood something in his heart: The three electors at the beginning of the meeting must have reached some kind of tacit understanding. These two young elders were both elected with high votes, and I am afraid they were both recommended by the other two. The support of the elders represented by people.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka's guess was correct. When Theonia was first established, the Turiyi sect headed by Kunogorata and the Amendolara sect headed by Cornelus, in order to suppress the power of Davos, , there was considerable cooperation with each other. Later, Davos became king, Kunogorata died, and the Senate finally completely tamed Davos.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, people from other regions continued to enter the Senate, impacting the dominant position of the Amendolara sect and the Turui sect. In order to ensure their right to speak in the Senate, they attracted people who had always had good relations with them and whose status continued to rise. The Lucanian faction, as long as their interests do not conflict, the elders of these three factions can basically remain consistent... So when Stromboli saw that the situation was not good just now, there was no guarantee that Flocrates could be stable. After winning, he immediately gave up and winked at Vespa and Hermon. The two Lucanian senators who had cooperated for many years immediately understood what it meant, while Burkos, who had always been busy with government affairs and not very flexible in politics, After being reminded quietly by Ansitanos next to him, he realized that he also chose to abstain, so the three major factions reached a silent cooperation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Many elders who had come to understand applauded and congratulated Flocrates, but they also thought in their hearts: I wonder which regional chief executive will be elected, and Mikhippus of Thurii will pop up again?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The next step is to elect the chief executive of the southern region of Sardinia." Rotating chairman Antaoris continued to advance the meeting.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The southern region of Sardinia is home to seven or eight former Phoenician towns headed by Kalaris, more than half of which are seaside towns with a large population, prosperous maritime trade, and relatively fertile riverine plains. Such a region The strength is not weaker than that of some regions in Greater Greece, which naturally attracts many elders to be elected.

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the etiquette officer carefully looked at the people who raised their hands, he shouted loudly: "Lord Brelu!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Brelu quickly stood up and said loudly in a loud voice: "I recommend Lord Tellis! Lord Tellis's ability, It is obvious to everyone that he has served as chief executive for more than 10 years and has achieved outstanding results in each term. He also actively responded to His Majesty's call and went to the Latium region during the war, and bravely served as Ostia, which was at the forefront of the war. The administrator of the city successfully assisted the expeditionary army to win.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Moreover, Lord Tellis adhered to the "Theonian Laws". During the Laodicean incident that year, he was one of the few people who never interacted with Laodicean. A Sicilian senator, so I think only Lord Tellis can govern the southern Sardinia region where Phoenicians are the majority and the people are relatively wealthy, and there will be no problems such as corruption and bribery."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Brelu said .
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The words were very straightforward, which made Antonios in the venue feel a little embarrassed.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sedorum was also embarrassed. He did not expect that Brelu, who was also from Bruti, would recommend an outsider without consulting him in advance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But in fact, although the Bruti people were one of the races that joined Theonia earlier, the large-scale rebellion in the South Italian War caused the Bruti forces to suffer heavy losses in Theonia. After Baguilippi passed away, Sedorum became the leader of the Bruti people, but unlike Vispa and Hermon, he cared more about the people of the original Vig City and did not care enough about the development of other young Bruti officials. , so the Bruti people's political cohesion in the kingdom has never been enough.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the past few years, Cedorum has grown older and discovered that Bruti's talents have withered, so he began to pay attention to this issue.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Brelu is from Brutia, he has been in the army all year round and has a closer relationship with the military elders. Even though he was dismissed from the position of commander of the Seventh Army because he made mistakes during the Western Mediterranean War, He did not quit the army, and after the war, he was appointed military training adjutant by Xiros (actually an instruction from Davos, because he believed that any legion commander in Brelu's position at the time had to The order to rescue, despite a lot of sacrifices, maintained the popular support of the people of Catania and the morale of the army. Breru made the right choice, but he was responsible for it. He had withdrawn from his post. It was to maintain the majesty of military law, and his subsequent appointment was to make up for the debt owed to him by the Ministry of Military Affairs). His relationship with the military elders was even better than with the Brutians.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Moreover, Sedorum felt that it was impossible for Bloom to say the above-mentioned words with his political level. He had never had any dealings with Tellis in the past. He must have been under the instruction of those in the army. The recommender who just came forward was Felicius?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Or Alexis?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sedorum glanced suspiciously at the two military ministers who were talking in low voices, and finally fell on Saru, another Bruti elder.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before Cedorum joined Theonia, Saru was the successor he trained for Veg City. However, after Bruti merged into Theonia, despite Cedorum's full support, Salu's development in the kingdom's political arena was not very smooth. His ability to handle government affairs was not strong, and several setbacks made him lack confidence in managing a region alone. However, he himself has always been very interested in commanding operations, but he was blocked at the time. Due to Dorum's dissuasion, he did not enter the military as early as possible. Later, when the political situation was not going well, he wanted to transfer, but he was already old and it was no longer possible to start as a team officer.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, Saru was looking at Sedorum anxiously, because Sedorum was also preparing to ask Saru to nominate someone - Hegesitus.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Hegesitus was not a Brutian, he had lived in the Brutian area for decades after all. Most of the tribesmen he led to resist now still live in the Brutian area, and they still play an important role in the kingdom's politics. Several talents emerged.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The important thing is that Hegesitus has served as the administrator of important towns in the kingdom many times, and his administrative skills are quite good. In recent years, Cedorum has had a lot of cooperation with him in the Senate, but he felt that the Brutians were not strong enough. In this case, he was determined to incorporate Hegesitus and his tribe into his own sect.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But in the eyes of some senators, Braylu belongs to the Brutian sect. He has already recommended Teles, and now Saru recommends Hegesitus. This will not only make the senators who support him feel at a loss, but also make others laugh. The most important thing is that now that Brelu has the support of the military, Cedorum is not sure that Hegesitus can win... After thinking about it, he shook his head slightly towards Saru.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Cedorum's judgment was accurate. Although Tellis had several competitors, he was still elected with a high vote count.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The candidates for the three regional chief executives have been determined. This day's selection seems to have just ended, because the regions to be discussed next are all in Italy and Sicily. This is what most senators are most concerned about, so many people are not aware of it. He straightened his body and waited for Antaoris to speak.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The next region to be elected is the eastern plains of Campania!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The eastern plain of Campania not only includes Enona, Naconia, Rolla, Sessala, Pompeii and other towns in the original Campania region, but also includes Cavutim and Beneventum. Such as the original Samnite town, it can be said that it occupies the most important and best area in this area, thereby achieving the strategic purpose of controlling and balancing the Samnite and Campanian people, but precisely because of it He is very important, so there are many elders who like him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The first senator to stand up was Pollet. In fact, he was not a very senior Theonia senator, but he cooperated with Theonia very early. In the South Italian War and the Western Mediterranean War, They all provided great help to Theonia's final victory, and also took the initiative to persuade their own people to incorporate Potentia, a Lucanian town that is extremely important to the kingdom, into Theonia, so since From the day he entered the Senate, he attracted the attention and respect of the senators.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The etiquette officer also asked him to speak first out of respect.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I recommend Kesima!" Polet said with a loud voice: "Ksima has served as the chief executive of Niutum, Elia, Kopsa... and other towns, and has great influence on the Lucanian mountainous area and Samonei. He is very familiar with the mountainous area and the Samnite people. I believe that as the administrator of the eastern region of Campania, he can well maintain the stability of that area and prevent the Samnite people from causing trouble."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pole Although Te's words were short, it can be seen that he still has a deep prejudice against the Samnites.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Saru finally stood up: "I recommend Hegesitus..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Gorkis, the former Castelon senator, also stood up and recommended his friend Amycles.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The original Heracleian senator Triphias recommended his friend Tudeples, the senator from Metapontum...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Among these recommenders, one is particularly eye-catching, he is the current Dio Mentotic Els, president of the Academy of Nea, although compared with his good friend Mattikles, he sometimes attended Senate meetings (for these scholar-type senators, in order not to delay their research, through Davos A proposal was passed: Unless it is some important meetings that they must attend, they do not need to attend other meetings), but they have never participated in the selection of the town chief executive.
