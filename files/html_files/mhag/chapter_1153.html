   Chapter 1153 The reaction of Thessaly and Thebes
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Are you saying that the Helots in our territory will rebel under its influence?!" Archidamus's expression became solemn: The Helots would rebel. This is not without precedent. This is what happened in the second and third Messelia Wars.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Father, after you go back, you must propose to the council to strengthen the control of helots, and if necessary, kill them several times to achieve the purpose of shock."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Archidamus said that he was right about the random slaughter of helots .
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As easy as slaughtering cattle and sheep, Agesilaus did not feel strange, but nodded in agreement.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus continued: "On the way to the dock, I also saw the Theonians transporting baggage into the camp. Not only did they transport the baggage with a large number of pack cars and laborers, but also some soldiers, team officers and Craftsmen, they are mainly responsible for guarding, commanding and maintaining. Although the entire transportation team is relatively large, it is very orderly and there is no chaos... I have long heard that the Theonian army also has a specially equipped transportation team. This is the first time I have seen it with my own eyes-" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Father, it's no big deal that the Theonian army has a special transport team. Don't the Persians also have one? We haven't been defeated by us many times! (The Greeks usually fight with their own soldiers. Rations. During the battle, if the rations are almost exhausted, either local grains will be harvested, or the commander will come forward to open a market near the garrison. Businessmen from all over the place will bring grains and supplies to the garrison to facilitate the purchase of soldiers.) "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Archi Damus said disapprovingly: "Look at what you said, father, it is a hospital and a transport team. I think the Theonians have provided the army's logistics so well. Can their soldiers still endure hardship? You know The victory of the war will ultimately be determined on the battlefield. Only an army that has undergone arduous training and is not afraid of death can win the final victory!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Archidamus was obviously full of confidence in the combat effectiveness of the Spartan warriors, and Agsilao Si had to say in a deep voice: "I am saying this to tell you that the Theonian army is different from the other Greek city-state armies we have encountered before. We must treat it with caution. Today's Sparta can no longer withstand it. A failure...cough...cough..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You are right, I understand. You have just been injured. You need to have a good rest and don't talk any more." Archidamus warned a few words and turned around. Go to the bow.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus sighed helplessly. He saw that his son was perfunctory. This is why he was over 60 years old, frail and sick, and still led the army to fight everywhere. He was not satisfied with Archidamus. So reassuring!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He looked at the coast in the distance, thinking about what he had seen at the Theonia military camp before, the worry on his face became heavier, and the thought in his mind came up again: If Leoticides could really come back, Arrive at Sparta...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ……………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Muklu returned to the camp and entered the military tent, only to find that Leoticides was still sitting on the main seat, motionless. He seemed to be thinking about something.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He stepped forward and said softly: "Your Majesty Commander, that... the Spartan envoy is fine after being treated by the medical camp and has left by boat..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides seemed to have come back to his senses at this time. Come, look up at him and ask: "What did you say?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Muklu coughed lightly: "The Spartan envoy has been sent away."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides nodded without speaking. People are immersed in thinking again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Leoticides had the habit of often falling into deep thought during the war, Muklu, who had worked with him for many years, still felt that something was wrong with him at this moment. He did not have the uncomfortable feeling in the past. He remembered that he had been like this He also made a joke to Leotychides once, saying that Leotychides was always thinking about how to defeat his enemies, but this momentum affected the people around him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Could it be that he is thinking about...his uncle... Just as Muklu was thinking about it, Leoticides' voice sounded in his ears: "Bring me paper and pen."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Muklu After hurriedly getting it, he asked: "What order do you want to give?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides looked at him, and his calm tone became more firm: "There is no order. I want to write a letter to His Majesty."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Muklu, who felt slightly uneasy, walked out of the tent without asking any further questions.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The papyrus has been spread on the table and the pen is stained with ink, but Leoticides has not yet started writing. In his mind, the images of his mother's suicide and Agesilaus kneeling before him alternate. It can be said that Agesilaus's visit caused him a lot of trouble, not because he completely believed Agesilaus's words, but because Agesilaus knelt down to admit his mistake and cut him off. The sword of Agesilaus had made many years of hatred disappear. At this moment, his heart felt empty and unfulfilled, and the scenes of his life in Sparta were also stirred up from the depths of his memory...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, for so many years in Theonia, Leoticides has always maintained the pride of being a Spartan warrior. Now this pride suddenly turned into a complicated attachment to his hometown, making him lose his confidence in his hometown. He has the desire to continue fighting, and he is also very aware that after this incident, other generals and soldiers are more suspicious of him. If he leads such an army to fight in such a state, the result will probably be very bad!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Leoticides took a deep breath and resolutely picked up his pen.
  </font>
 </font>

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the envoys of the Arcadian League asked Athens for help and were rejected, they had no choice but to turn to Thebes.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, the news that "the Theonian army captured Messenia" spread throughout the Peloponnese and quickly spread to central and northern Greece.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Jason, who had been paying close attention to the situation in the south, soon learned the news and was very surprised. In the past, he had heard about this newly rising Western Mediterranean power, but he was not deeply impressed. After all, this country's influence on mainland Greece Its power was minimal, but this time it actually dared to declare war directly on Sparta, and it also gained an advantage, making him realize that Theonia's power was probably not a lie, so he suspended the military operations he was preparing and decided to first Observe the development of the situation in the south and then make plans.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He sent many spies to the Peloponnese Peninsula to inquire about the news, and also tried his best to collect information about the Kingdom of Theonia. He spent most of his time in Philae's mansion with his men based on the news they constantly received. To analyze the situation in the south, he reduced the number of inspections to the military camp outside the city, so that he could safely spend the day in the city where he was assassinated in his previous life.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For the Theban government, the request of the Arcadian League envoys put them in a dilemma. Whether it was to follow the approach of "the enemy of my enemy is a friend", or from a strategic point of view, the establishment of the Arcadian League was very important to them. This is a great thing for Thebes. It greatly weakened Sparta's power. As long as Thebes and the Arcadian alliance can unite, they can completely suppress Sparta in the Peloponnese. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But Thessaly in the north was in full swing, and the news that "Jason was going to lead his army south" was rampant. Even Thebes, which had an alliance with Jason, felt great pressure and sent an envoy to Philae. To find out, Jason was always perfunctory and did not give a clear answer, which made Thebes even more wary.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even though Pelopidas and Epamelonda insisted on sending reinforcements to support the Arcadian Alliance, they were strongly opposed by other members of the council. Their reasons were very good: the security of Thebes could not be ensured. Next, the citizens of Thebes who have already suffered the pain of losing their city will never agree to join the army and leave the Boeotian region, and other Boeotian city-states allied with Thebes will not agree for the same reason. Send reinforcements.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the previous life, Thebes also hesitated about this matter for a long time. It was not until Jason was assassinated and civil strife broke out in Thessaly that Thebes decided to reinforce the Arcadian Alliance.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In this life, Jason has been safe and sound. Although the military mobilization in Thessaly has stopped, the pressure has always existed. How could Thebes dare to be careless.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But when the news came that "Theonia captured Messenia", the Thebans were overjoyed and felt deeply: Compared with the ally in the north that could turn against the enemy at any time, the newly allied kingdom in the west was Undoubtedly more reliable.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the Battle of Leuctra, the Thebans led by Ipamirondas originally wanted to use this victory to expand their results. However, due to Jason's obstruction and other reasons, they had no choice but to fight with Spar. Da signed the armistice contract, and he was actually very unwilling to do so. Now Theonia has directly dealt a heavy blow to Sparta's home base. The Spartans will inevitably turn the focus of their attack to the Theonia army, and Thebes The military pressure on the south and north that they were suddenly facing was suddenly greatly relieved. The excited Thebans decided to send envoys to Messenia to express condolences to the Theonian army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ipamilonda volunteered.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, Pelopidas solemnly told the Arcadian Alliance envoy: Although Thebes is temporarily unable to support the Arcadian Alliance, Thebes sympathizes with the situation of the Arcadians and is willing to recognize the Acadian Alliance. The Dia Alliance is also willing to form an alliance with it, and will also send envoys to Messenia to persuade the alliance Theonia to assist the Arcadian Alliance in repelling the upcoming invasion of the Spartans.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Arcadian envoy was excited when they heard this, and the entire envoy immediately divided into two parts: one stayed in Thebes to discuss alliance matters, and the other followed the Theban envoy south to Messenia.
  </font>
 </font>

   "I didn't expect that this Proseus was actually the prince of Sparta!" In the palace meeting hall, Davos patted a pile of letters. These letters all come from the army as far away as Messenia. There are secret reports written by the intelligence department, letters written by Olivers and other army commanders, letters written by military judges... The letter at the top is Leotychides himself wrote it.
