   and look at this place called a naval base by the Theonians. It is not a military port as the Greeks understand it at all. It is simply a town. However, according to the captain of the clipper: the people living in the base are all The crew and family members of the Theonian navy

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ... The number of ships is around four or five hundred..." He thought there was something wrong with this before, but now it seems that it is probably true... At
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   this time, Xenophon has realized that he has been making a mistake since yesterday. Wrong: When he looked at Theonia with the eyes he was used to looking at Greek city-states, he naturally felt that nothing was wrong. But in fact, Theonia is not an ordinary city-state, it is a kingdom, a country similar to Persia!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Xenophon adjusted his mentality, he continued to be shocked during the rest of the trip.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The ship left the port of Tarentum and sailed into the "Gulf of Thurii" named by the Theonians, but in Xenophon's view, this is not a bay, it is just a sea area, but this sea area It is surrounded on three sides by the land of Theonia and has become a convenient route for coastal towns to trade with each other. Therefore, a group of Spartan envoys constantly saw an endless stream of ships traveling from all directions around the passenger ship, as if they were They are in a prosperous port, but in fact they are on the vast sea, but the Theonians completely turned this sea area into their inland sea.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the passenger ship arrived at the mouth of the Krati River, they were even more surprised by the prosperity and hustle and bustle of the port. They were shocked by the huge size and large population of Thurii City. Even the few Sis in the envoy group who were the least satisfied with this mission were The Badans also became uneasy, because even the most stupid people can realize that with such prosperous trade and a large population, Theonia is fully capable of sending a large army to Sparta, who were in trouble at the moment, were in big trouble.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, everyone in the envoy group became a little heavy-hearted, and gradually they stopped even speaking.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the passenger ship entered the inner city port of Turiyi, officials from the Theonia Ministry of Foreign Affairs came to greet them. However, they did not take the envoys to the Kingdom Hotel first, but took them directly to the palace because King Davos wanted to meet Spar immediately. The messenger.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Walking in the inner city block, Xenophon saw the dazzling Hades colossus on the hill in the distance, which made him feel like he was in the inner city of Athens, but in fact there was still a big difference between the two: Thurii The inner city is obviously much quieter and tidier than Athens, and there are many strange buildings, such as the rumored viaduct, the huge water wheel, the automatic water fountain, and the triumphal arch representing the glory of Theonia, which is different. The arena, the library with its unique shape and profound meaning, the majestic meeting hall...the eyes of the envoys were overwhelmed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xenophon knew that Theonia had been established less than 30 years ago, but at this moment he had an illusion: the city of Thurii has a profound and long cultural heritage.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Finally they came to the palace with the Theonian flag flying high. They only let Xenophon serve as deputy envoy, and the envoy was a Spartan general who had made many military exploits. This way, they could monitor Xenophon and prevent him from doing wrong things, and at the same time, minimize criticism from the people) Under the guidance of the etiquette officer, we walked into the palace.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Due to what he had seen and heard before, even the Spartan envoy, who was known for his domineering and arrogant nature, was a little nervous at the moment, not to mention Xenophon. He had already forgotten the joy of meeting his old friend and was filled with thoughts. The question is: How to complete the task assigned to him by the Spartans while preventing the powerful Theonians from retaliating?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, the Spartan envoys have arrived!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Invite them in."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The voice was steady and thick, almost no longer as familiar as it once was... Xenophon calmed down, rearranged his clothes, and stepped into the hall. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition to the palace guards and ministers of the kingdom's main departments, there are also six former rotating presidents of the Senate. They are not here by chance, but have been serving in the palace in the past few years, because they are now called "Kingdom Assistants". Minister of State."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the second year after Theonia conquered Gaul, at a Senate meeting, a newly promoted senator suddenly launched an attack and criticized: The current Senate system is flawed, and the rotating presidents preside over Senate meetings as well. , and at the same time participate in the administrative affairs of the kingdom, which allows them to obtain more important information in advance and use their rights to better help those close to them, which is unfair to other senators.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   His words immediately caused an uproar in the Senate. The senators who supported the rotating chairman criticized him one after another. The senators who had been dissatisfied with this for a long time were not willing to be outdone and helped the senator to refute, and gave many examples of the current situation. In the past few years, Li was an example of the elders who won the election with the help of the rotating chairman...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The two sides had a fierce quarrel on this matter, which did not subside for several days, and even tended to expand. Finally, King Davos intervened forcefully , restored order to the Senate, but also carried out some new reforms to the Senate: the rotating chairman of the Senate will be held by the senators in turn, and there will no longer be a fixed number of people;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   in addition to formulating and amending legal provisions, the Senate In addition to selecting regional chief executives and supervising the administrative performance of middle- and high-level officials, all administrative decisions and foreign affairs of the kingdom will no longer be submitted to the Senate for review and approval, but will be directly decided by the Kingdom's Administration Office;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   the kingdom will establish the position of Assistant Minister , a total of 6 people, whose terms are the same as those of ministers, and will assist the king in managing the administrative affairs of the kingdom.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the term of office expires, the Senate can be elected and the king can approve the successor...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Davos took advantage of this turmoil in the Senate to reform it, the powers of the Senate were reduced, the functions became more single, and more powers were taken over. It was returned to the Kingdom Administration Office, making administrative efficiency faster and more efficient.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reason why the Senate made such a big concession was because since Davos was named "Hades", his prestige in the kingdom was unprecedented. Ordinary senators did not dare to fight against him, but they had the ability to organize everyone. The opposing rotating presidents were caught in the act and became the core of the turmoil. They had no time to take care of themselves. In addition, Davos used the position of auxiliary minister to give them a way out, so his plan to take over power went smoothly in the end. be realized.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xenophon certainly did not understand the changes in the political arena of the Kingdom of Theonia, and he did not pay attention to the ministers standing on both sides. Since entering the hall, his eyes have been looking at the man sitting high on the throne.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But Davos, who was wearing the crown, stood up, walked down from the throne with excitement, strode up to Xenophon, and gave him a strong hug.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because things happened so fast, the ministers and guards in the palace had no time to stop them, and they heard Davos' hearty laughter: "Xenophon, Xenophon, I thought I would never see you again in this life. Unexpectedly, with the blessing of Hades, we finally meet again!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos's sudden move was beyond Xenophon's expectations, and he was quite touched. He immediately put aside the pre-planned details of the meeting. When he said that, he sighed and said: "Yes, we haven't seen each other for 27 years since Byzantium!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You have a good memory." Davos put his hands behind his back, leaned slightly and looked at him, smiling. Asked: "Do you remember what I said then?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xenophon frowned in thought for a while, then shook his head: "I don't remember."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos raised his eyebrows slightly, pointed around, and said slowly: "I said at the time, 'I'm going to Magna Graecia. Established a country of my own and invited you to join, but you refused'... 27 years have passed, do you think what I said at that time has come true?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Dear Your Majesty the King of Theonia, your Majesty in Persia You have created countless miracles when you were young, so if you do anything amazing in the future, I will take it as a matter of course." Xenophon replied calmly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Hahaha..." Davos laughed heartily again. He patted Xenophon on the shoulder and said meaningfully: "I haven't seen you for so many years, but you have become very good at talking. It's because I have been with you for a long time. The reason why King Agesilaus of Sparta stayed together?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's because everything I saw in Theonia made me feel awe!" Xenophon said sincerely.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos looked at him, suppressed his smile, and said seriously: "Every time I read the book "The Long March" you wrote, I will think of the difficult days when we shared weal and woe in Persia, and our friendship. It should not fade away with the passage of time, just like Theonia will always treat its friends sincerely no matter how powerful it is. So over the years, I have specially asked messengers to send you invitations and invite you to Theonia Participating in the Scholars Conference allowed us to get together properly, but we were never able to do so..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ..." Xenophon felt guilty and remained silent without responding.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It seems that you are not doing well in Sparta!" Davos said half-jokingly and half-seriously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "That's wrong!" Someone next to him immediately retorted loudly: "Xenophon is highly respected in Sparta, otherwise he would not be allowed to serve as an envoy to your Theonia this time!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos's eyes immediately It became sharp and stabbed the man wearing a red cloak with his hair in a thick braid. He asked in a deep voice: "Who are you?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Gathyrus, a Spartan citizen, appointed by the Council of Elders. , Accompanying Xenophon on his mission to Theonia." The man did not avoid Davos' sharp gaze and answered with a loud voice.
