  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Nectanipos learned that there had been changes in the city and angrily led his army to reinforce the city gate, the Theonian army had already rushed into the city under the leadership of Memphis officials.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a day of fierce fighting in the city, the rebels were defeated, Nectanipos was also captured, and the Theonian army entered the city of Memphis.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Immediately on the second day, Foreign Minister Tapirus, who accepted the instructions of Davos and came to Egypt with the army, began to meet frequently with Memphis officials and priests of several temples in the city.

   It was already mid-August, "The Holy Kingdom of Theonia officially declared war on Persia and was forming a Greek coalition to prepare for the attack. The news of "Asia Minor" has reached Babylon, which shocked Artaxerxes. This Persian king, who had suffered repeated military defeats and had done nothing, did not know when he would continue to pay attention to the man in the far west even if he encountered any obstacles. The victorious and ever-expanding Kingdom of Theonia was a little afraid, and he couldn't help saying in public: "It's finally here!..." Then
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   he stood up suddenly and shouted: "Go and get it Trebassus is calling!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, Lord Trebassus has been sent by you to conquer Egypt!" a minister reminded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Artaxerxes then seemed to have woken up from a dream. He stood blankly for a moment, and then asked: "Where is he now?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "He is still gathering troops in Syria."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Artaxerxes sat down again, holding his fist. , pondered for a while, and said slightly nervously: "...The order to attack Egypt has been temporarily cancelled, let him come back first. Preparing for the invasion of the Theonian army is the most important thing at present!... Put the secret spies in the capital Send me out to monitor the movements in mainland Greece at all times...At the same time, notify the governors of each region to immediately mobilize military forces. The garrisons in each region are assembled and on standby, waiting for my orders!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Yes, your Majesty!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ………… ……………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Artaxerxes realized: Although Theonia has officially declared war on Persia, it will take some time for the Greek coalition to complete its formation and invade Persian territory.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But he did not expect that Leoticides had led the Tenth Legion and the Eleventh Legion to Thessaly, and the Theonian commander had a detailed understanding of the enemy situation on the other side of the Aegean Sea, and after repeated thinking , made a resolute decision: not to wait for the Greek armies to gather together before attacking Asia Minor, but to take advantage of the fact that the Persians had not completed their defense preparations and send a vanguard force to land in Asia Minor to occupy a foothold for further landing operations of the subsequent army. provide assurance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The commander of the Tenth Army, Stepros, is the adopted son of Amyntas, a famous figure in the Theonian army. He is a good friend of Patroclus and an old subordinate of Leoticides. He has a deep understanding of his abilities. , so this task was given to him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Stepophos, who was in his prime and eager to make another great contribution, took over this important task without hesitation, and after discussing with Leoticides, he targeted the beaches of the Misia region in western Asia Minor.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reason why we chose this place is simple: take a boat from Philae Port in Thessaly to the east, across the Aegean Sea, and reach western Asia Minor. The closest straight line is Mysia, which is also the westernmost region of Persia today. Naturally, Persian dominance is also weakest here.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because Mysia is close to mainland Greece, there are many colonial towns established by the Greeks in the area. Persian rule here has always been unstable. During the wave of rebellion in Asia Minor against Persian rule, Mysia was also one of them. One, because Artaxerxes promulgated some laws during the war that were beneficial to the Greek colonial city-states in Asia Minor, such as giving them more autonomy, paying less taxes, and having more freedom in religious belief. ... Therefore, most of the Greek city-states in Asia Minor did not participate in that rebellion, nor did they provide support to the rebels. On the contrary, they provided a certain degree of cooperation with the Persian army's attack.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, after the rebellion was put down and the new governors of various regions in western Asia Minor took office, many of them did not implement the decrees announced by the Persian king. One of them was Theopompus, the governor of Mysia. This caused a stir in Greece within his territory. The dissatisfaction of the city-state.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This Persian nobleman from Susa obviously did not expect that the Greeks under his jurisdiction would dare to oppose his decision. Most of the other local ethnic groups, including the Persians, looked on with cold eyes. Few people were willing to move closer to this outsider, resulting in a dispute. For more than many years, Theopompus's rule over Misia was still very weak, and the political situation in Misia was very disordered.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A few days later, a total of more than 8,000 soldiers of the fully prepared Theonian Tenth Army boarded a troop transport ship at the port of Philae. Under the escort of the Fourth Fleet, they sailed straight east and successfully landed in Mihai two days later. beaches in western Asia, and at the same time quickly captured Tenedos, an unsuspecting island not far from the landing beach.

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In September, the news that "King Davos will personally lead an army to attack Persia" has just been officially announced, and the palace office The hall welcomed several guests.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos looked at these guests, pretending to be surprised and asked: "What a good day is today for you to come and visit me?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty!" Felicius, who has been retired for many years, replied respectfully: "We I heard that you were going to personally lead the army to attack Persia, so everyone was very excited and made an appointment to come to see you. I hope you will allow us to go with you to the land where we have fought side by side through life and death!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Your Majesty! Over the years, I can't forget those comrades who died in Persia. We were so anxious to escape that we buried their bodies in a hurry without even putting a copper coin in our mouths... This time When I go to Persia, I must transport their bones back to my hometown and bury them properly, so that their wandering souls can smoothly return to Hades..." Alexis, who has always been relatively calm, also said emotionally.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "There are also Clearchus, Proxenus, and Menon. I heard that their heads were sent to Babylon and randomly discarded in the garbage dump by the Persians. Even if they spend a lot of effort, they may not be able to find them. But... it is everyone's common wish to collect their bones and bring them back to their hometown!" Immediately afterwards, Hieronymus finished speaking seriously, and Tormid, Agarcia and others immediately echoed loudly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Everyone's common wish?" Davos heard something from these words.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, we are here to request you on behalf of the majority of the old mercenaries who are still alive and idle at home, hoping to follow you back to Persia!" Epithenes said loudly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos looked at Felicius, Alexis, Hieronimus, Thormedes, Marigi, Agalia, Epithenes, Martius, Geogris... When the faces of these white-haired and wrinkled old people were swept across, they finally landed on Amyntas.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Theonian general who once had outstanding military exploits and was extremely brave was now completely unable to stand. He could only sit slumped in a wooden wheelchair and was pushed into the palace by his trusted servants.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Due to being unable to walk for a long time, his originally burly body became very puffy. While everyone was talking, he actually closed his eyes and snored.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos couldn't help but whispered: "Amintas."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Huh..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Amintas!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Huh?..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Are you going to Persia too?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Under the push of the slave , Amyntas finally woke up. He supported the armrests of the wooden chair with both hands, tried his best to sit up, and gasped: "Your Majesty... even if I die... I will die on the way to Babylon! . . . "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos looked around at everyone again and asked solemnly: "Do you have the same idea?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Felicius looked back at the others, and after receiving their nods, he replied seriously: "Your Majesty, we Following you, we have won countless victories in the past few decades. The only regret is that we were driven back like dogs by the Persians in Persia. This time we want to follow you to make up for this regret, even if we die on the way to the battle. , that is also the glory of our lifelong battle!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, I have one more request!" Epithenes shouted from behind: "If I really die on the way, please allow my slaves to carry my body Enter Babylon so that I can see with my own eyes what the Hanging Gardens that the Babylonians boast about look like!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Martius immediately complained to him in a low voice with dissatisfaction: "We all agreed in advance, but you violated the agreement and suddenly asked His Majesty Such a request is really too much! What can you see if a person is dead? Apologize to Your Majesty quickly and take back your unreasonable request!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I am happy. I don't think Your Majesty will blame me." Epithenes said He looked so indifferent that Martius was so angry that he grabbed his clothes and wanted to beat him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Okay, okay." Davos waved his hand, looked at everyone, and said sternly: "I can allow you to go to Persia with me, but - you are all veterans who have fought with me for many years, and you all know Dionysus well. Runner-up, you should understand that this war against Persia will determine the ownership of the entire Mediterranean. It is related to the rise and fall of the two countries and cannot be ignored. Therefore, you must have the mentality of "fighting instead of playing" and must obey all orders. , Follow the command! If someone can't do it, it's better to quit now, otherwise when someone violates military law, I will never show mercy!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty, please rest assured that we will fight for our whole life and will never be at the last moment. Even if you ruin your reputation, you will never let the juniors look down upon you!" Felicius, Alexis and others said in unison.
