   Chapter 1265 About Egypt

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crotocathax is no longer the simple young man who graduated from Tulii School. He has gone from an ordinary tribune in Rome to the administrator of Rome, from an ignorant recruit to commanding the army. In the end, he won the Greek War and served as consul. He actively participated in the administrative management of the kingdom's government affairs for five years... Under the deliberate training of Davos, Clotokatax has grown into a qualified leader with both civil and military skills. .

 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, he would no longer think about problems based only on his likes and dislikes, but would consider the gains and losses of the overall interests from the perspective of the kingdom. So after pondering for a while, he did not express his objection clearly, but reminded with some concern: "Father, we are about to launch an attack on Persia. At this time, we have to conquer Egypt. Will it affect the original military plan? Egypt is an ancient kingdom after all, with its own unique civilization and a large population. The political situation is complicated, and it may not be easy to conquer it. If it causes continued resistance from the Egyptians and delays the war, it will be troublesome." "

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This possibility cannot be ruled out." Davos nodded slightly and said, "So We must try our best to avoid such a situation. From a historical perspective, today's Egyptians are not a strong nation. In more than 100 years, they have been invaded and ruled by Ethiopians and Persians, and now the Egyptians are not a strong nation. The dynasty established by Niebu and the others was also dominated by Libyans. Most of the time, the Egyptian people were relatively submissive, so why couldn't they be ruled by us Theonians? After

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   all, Theonia and Egypt have been Trade exchanges are close, and our cheap and high-quality goods are flooding the Egyptian people. Egyptian businessmen and civilians have a good impression of us. And because the two countries are allies, the troops we have sent to Egypt in recent years have strictly observed discipline and did not harass the local people. He does not buy or sell by force, and always takes the lead in battles. His performance is far better than Egypt's own army, and he has won a good reputation in Egypt. This has laid a good foundation for us to conquer Egypt in the future."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos He paused, pondered for a while, reorganized his thoughts, and then slowly said the thoughts he had thought about for a long time in a confident and firm tone: "As long as we can do the following, I believe that what you are worried about will be solved." This will not happen, and our rule over Egypt will be very stable! First, you are right what you just said. Egypt is indeed a kingdom with a unique civilization and has an extremely long history. We cannot use the methods of governing other regions. To govern Egypt, you must first treat it as a unique region of the kingdom and rule it with the methods of the Egyptian Pharaohs-"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Using the methods of the Egyptian Pharaohs..." Clotokatax mused.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Although we Theonians believe in Hades and other gods, the Egyptians are far more devout to gods than we are. They dedicated all their life and death to gods, and the gods dominated their lives. Everything, so we must get the support of the Egyptian monks, like Tanib, to recognize the rights they once had, to recognize their autonomy in the upper reaches of the Nile, and not even let the Hades faith spread in Egypt, thereby getting them Let's cooperate fully to help us consolidate our rule in Egypt."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hearing this, Crotokatax stopped talking.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos knew what his son was thinking, patted him on the shoulder, and said gently: "As the descendants of Hades, we have done a lot for him. I think he will forgive us! After all, it is a very big piece of land." In this ancient land, the gods there are older than him. He should have never expected to be recognized by the Egyptians..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax was silent for a moment, and finally nodded slightly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Second, I have read the information about Egypt collected by the intelligence department in detail. When these foreign races ruled the Egyptians in the past, Persia encountered the most fierce resistance. Why? Because the Persian king gave all the land in the Egyptian Delta to The Persian nobles regarded the Egyptians in their fiefdoms as slaves and oppressed them extremely severely. Of course, they met with fierce resistance from the Egyptians. Why did Artaxerxes attack Egypt several times? I'm afraid there is something behind this. The Egyptian nobles pushed hard because they were unwilling to give up this land that made them richer.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And if we conquer Egypt, we must learn a lesson and not colonize as much as we did in the areas we conquered in the past. Instead, we must Try not to colonize Egypt or compete with the Egyptians for land..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos stretched out two fingers and said solemnly: "The divine rights and land, as long as we basically maintain the status quo of Egypt and don't make major changes, I think Theonia will surely conquer Egypt quickly and stabilize it quickly!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The divine power and land..." Crotocathax murmured, and asked hesitantly: "Father, we have made a decision Is the concession a bit too big? Will it leave huge hidden dangers for the future rule of Egypt?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Look, I didn't want to conquer Egypt just now, but now I'm starting to worry about power issues." Davos said jokingly .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Father, I-" Crotokartax was a little embarrassed and wanted to defend.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos smiled and waved his hand, and said: "We have made a lot of concessions, but as long as we can quickly stabilize Egypt, we will get a large granary and a stable territory in the Eastern Mediterranean! We are outsiders after all, In order to gain the recognition of the Egyptians, it was necessary to make big concessions at first. However, as time went by, the Egyptian people have fully accepted the rule of Theonia and fully recognized the royal family of Hades and Davos as Egypt's At that time, we will gradually make some changes to Egypt's governance...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Egypt's unique culture was gradually formed over a long period of time. We must be patient enough and cannot rush!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Kolotoka Tuckers thought for a moment and agreed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Okay, now our father and son have reached a consensus on the issue of Egypt." Davos tapped the chair and asked: "If we really want to send troops to conquer Egypt first, who do you think is the most suitable person to send to lead the troops? "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Proseus." Clotokatax said without hesitation: "His military command ability is one of the best in the kingdom, his political adaptability is not weak, and he is also very loyal to the kingdom. More importantly, He has experience fighting in Egypt, so he is the most suitable candidate!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Proseus is indeed a very suitable candidate, but using him to conquer Egypt would be overkill." Davos shook his head, and then spit out A person's name: "Just let Chalcides lead the army to go out."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Chalcides, commander of the Seventh Army..." Now Crotokatax was very familiar with the kingdom's army and generals, and he immediately recalled the relevant information. The general's resume.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos has already continued: "When Proseus was the commander of the Eighth Army, Chalcedis, as a Catanaan, was the first captain of the Eighth Army and performed very well in the war against Carthage. After the war, he was promoted to commander of the legion based on merit. In the Greek war, Proseus led the army to rescue Egypt. Chalcides' Eighth Legion was the main force. It contributed the most and performed best in the defensive war against the Persians... By This shows that he has strong military ability and is also familiar with Egypt.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And unlike Proseus, his communicative skills are not weak and he is good at handling the relationship between the army and the people. In the battle report about the Eighth Army in Egypt submitted by the Ministry of Military Affairs, he specifically mentioned, "Everywhere where the Eighth Army is stationed In cities and towns, Egyptian officials and people actively cooperated.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   'If we want to conquer Egypt and reduce the Egyptian people's dislike of Theonia, we need a commander who can flexibly handle the relationship between the two!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After listening to Davos's explanation, Clotokatax had no objection to Chalcedis being the commander-in-chief of the army to attack Egypt. He just reminded softly: "Father, these plans we have made are all Based on the possible death of Jie Hao, if Jie Hao is lucky enough to be alive, the alliance and friendship between the Kingdom and Egypt should still be maintained..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is natural!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, it is best to prepare for anything in advance to avoid being caught off guard when an accident does happen.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And after everything is ready, everything still depends on whether Hades will bless you..." Davos said in a calm tone, but there was a hint of imperceptible sternness in his eyes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then, he said in a more serious tone: " But if Jie Hao is really killed, in addition to letting Chalcedis lead the army to attack Egypt, the plan to attack Persia formulated by the Ministry of Military Affairs will probably be stepped up.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Greek coalition to conquer Persia must be formed as soon as possible. I am going to let Proseus serve as the commander of the coalition and launch an attack on Asia Minor as soon as possible to contain Persia and prevent it from attacking Egypt again, which will seriously affect our conquest of Egypt.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the sports meeting, the kingdom will immediately carry out military mobilization. I will lead the main force of the kingdom's army to Egypt to stabilize the situation there as soon as possible!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   With the war, the kingdom's affairs will inevitably be complicated, and the pressure from all aspects will increase. Moreover, all the kingdom's elite troops have been transferred to the Eastern Mediterranean, and the domestic defense strength has also been significantly reduced...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, in terms of administration, there are Sipulos and Antaoris. , Haka and others will assist you, and Olivers and Printors will also fully assist you in the military. I am also planning to let your brother-in-law Patroclus stay in Thurii to protect the security of the kingdom, but the burden on your shoulders The burden is still not light!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Father, don't worry!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I will do my best to maintain domestic stability and prosperity, and look forward to your triumphant return!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Klotokatax said in a deep voice.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos looked at his flourishing son carefully with soft eyes, but his expression seemed a little complicated.
  </font>
 </font>
