   Chapter 1227 Reunion at the Gates of Athens
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, Kallias walked into another military tent, where Crotokatax and Printoles were waiting.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Kalias lied, and they did not go to Argos. In fact, Crotok Cartaxus could directly refuse to meet the Athenian envoy, but this polite prince thought that doing so would be detrimental to people like Athens. It was a humiliation for the city-state, so I found such a reason, and I could also use the "surrender of Argos" to stimulate Athens.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Kalias, what's the result of the negotiation?" Clotokatax asked with interest.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Highness, the chief general of Athens said that he wants to go back to discuss this matter, but I don't think Athens will agree." Karias stated his judgment truthfully.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Athens is facing such a predicament. They are not planning to surrender. Are they preparing to be destroyed together with the city of Athens?!" Clotokatax was surprised and a little regretful, although he failed to enter the Theonian School. However, he had always had good grades when he was studying at Thurii School since he was a child. Since most of the teaching materials came from Athens, especially grammar, rhetoric and speech (after all, the Athenians created the glory of Greek civilization), he has always had a fondness for Athens in his heart. Good impression.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "After all, Athens was once the overlord of Greece, and now it is also one of the top powers in Greece. It is understandable that it is not willing to admit defeat." Printors saw his thoughts and reminded: "But if we want to attack Athens, We have to conquer Corinth first."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "But the city of Corinth has high walls and thick walls. It may not be easy to conquer it in a short time." Although Clotokatax said this, he still set his sights of hope on Printols.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Highness is right. The city of Corinth is not like ordinary Greek cities. Its city defense facilities have obviously been carefully constructed. It is impossible to capture it without a hard fight." Printors looked solemn. said.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I think this may be related to the fact that the Spartan coalition forces stormed the city of Corinth for several consecutive years during the Corinthian War. The Corinthians must have had more experience in how to defend the city of Corinth after that fierce city defense war." Karias interjected from the side.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This is a bit troublesome..." Crotokatax looked worried. Although he was a little reluctant when Davos asked him to serve as the commander of the expeditionary army at the beginning, after this period of battlefield After tempering his career, he not only adapted to battlefield life, but also began to enjoy the glory of battlefield victory like other generals. So at this time, he was really eager to go north to join forces with Patroclus and share the conquest of the great city of Athens. The glory of the city.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, the guard came in and reported: "Lycomedes wants to see you."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Invite him in quickly!" After Crotokatax finished speaking, he immediately adjusted his clothes and headed towards the door of the tent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax treated Lycomedes with such courtesy not only because Lycomedes was the head of Mantinia, but Mantinia is now the most determined Theonia in the Peloponnese Peninsula. and the only ally (Messenia and Lagnia are now two regions controlled by Theonia, and they are completely under the command of Theonia and are not counted as allies. Argos was forced to surrender. , loyalty has yet to be tested), and because Lycomedes personally led the army to join the Theonian army and participated in the battle against the Argos army. After defeating the Argos army, he also took the initiative to ask Croto Cartaxus proposed that he was "willing to surrender Argos" and succeeded in the end, so Cloteaucartaxus valued him particularly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Highness Clotokatax, I want to ask for your permission to go and surrender to Corinth."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lycomedes indeed went to the Three Treasures Palace for nothing, and gave it to Clotokatax as soon as he opened his mouth. Surprised, he hurriedly asked: "Lord Lycomedes, are you sure that the Corinthians will open the city and surrender?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lycomedes said seriously: "I am not completely sure, but I can give it a try. I am confident about the Corinthians. I am relatively familiar with it. Although Corinth is a strong country, the Corinthians are not good at fighting. They have no fertile land to cultivate. The only thing they rely on is to use the isthmus for sea and land trade. Therefore, most of the Corinthians are good at business. They There is no persistence, what is best is to adapt to the situation, and even do any unbelievable things for your own benefit.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just now I heard you talking about the Corinthian War outside the tent. In fact, the reason why the Corinthians were able to The long-term resistance to the Spartan coalition's attack relied more on the continuous support of the troops and supplies from Athens and Thebes. At that time, many Corinthian people quietly united and surrendered to the Spartans. If not With timely reinforcements, the outcome of that war would have been completely different.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now we have defeated the Greek coalition, and the Peloponnese is basically under our control, and I heard that another Dior army landed in Thessaly. The Nian army has united with the Thebans and even invaded Attica. As a result, the Corinthians not only have no support, but will also face the great danger of being attacked from both sides. I think the smart Corinthians should He will see the situation clearly and will not stupidly stop us from going north."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Great! Then please, sir, go to Corinth yourself!" Clotokatax said happily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "After listening to Lord Lycomedes, I have a small suggestion." Printors interjected: "Just now the Athenian envoy came to the camp to request an armistice and peace -" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Athens are going to surrender so soon? !" Lycomedes was a little surprised.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "They just asked for an armistice, but we refused, and the Athenian envoy was Callistratus," Callias said.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing this, Lycomedes felt something in his heart, and his face suddenly beamed with joy: "I understand. I will mention this matter in front of the Corinthians. I believe I can persuade them to surrender!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lycomedes left the military tent and said Go straight to the city of Corinth.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He was once somewhat dissatisfied with Theonia's gift of Tegea territory to Mandinia, because this directly led to the isolation of Mandinia from other city-states in Arcadia, but now that the matter is over, Lyco Medes had to accept the reality and quickly changed his mind, firmly believing that "the only way out for Mandinlia is to follow Theonia closely!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So when the Theonia army withdrew the Lagnia and Greek coalition forces When Mantinnia was besieged, it was he who convinced the people to hold on and not surrender, which led to today's great situation.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now he only hopes to do his best to let Theonia win the Greek war as soon as possible, so as to fulfill Theonia's promise to Mantinia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Corinthians are indeed smart. Although Callistratus falsely claimed that "he went to see the commander of Theonia in order to retrieve the remains of the Athenian citizens who died in the battle," this could not fool them. They already knew that "Theonia" "The Oonian army invaded Attica", so I suspected that the Athenians wanted to make a truce and negotiate a peace. If the Athenians surrendered, Corinth would be a fool to continue to hold on!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So when Lycomedes entered the city and explained his intention to the Corinthian senior officials, they got what they wanted.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What's more, the request made by Theonia is easy for Corinth to accept: to join the New Greek Alliance led by the Holy Kingdom of Theonia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lycomedes did not mention the request to "let Corinth dissolve its alliance". He did not mention this request when he lobbied Argos before. In fact, Theonia only asked Athens, because Athens' maritime alliance not only included love There are many islands in the Aegean Sea, and there are also some of its allies among the coastal city-states in Macedonia and Thrace and the coastal city-states in the Ukxing Sea. This range is too wide, and this is something that Davos, who wants to unify the Mediterranean, cannot allow. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Joining the New Hellenic League is no different from joining the Peloponnesian League and the Greek League. For Corinth, which has been reduced to an ordinary powerful country and does not have much ambition. Even the Corinthians feel that this will have a negative impact on Corinth's future. Maritime trade has great benefits, because since the establishment of Theonia, Corinth has been the city-state with the most trade with Theonia on mainland Greece.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotocathus led his army into Corinth smoothly, then went north along the eastern coast of the isthmus, and soon approached Megara, a city-state in the middle of the isthmus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There are mountains as barriers on both the south and north sides of Megara. If it is willing to defend, it can stop the Theonian army for a period of time. However, the northern part of Megara borders the Attica region. The people of the city-state just saw this a few days ago. Seeing the scene of the Athenian soldiers fleeing in panic and the Theonian army aggressively invading Attica, the timid Megarians did not think that their weak self could withstand the two-sided attack of the powerful Theonian army. Under the persuasion of the Corinthians , Megara obediently joined the New Greek Alliance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crotokatax led his army through the territory of Megara easily, entered the Attica region, and successfully joined Patroclus' army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Athenian citizens on the top of the city felt palpitated when they saw another mighty Theonian army coming from the Theonian military camp outside the city.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the days since Callistratus left, urgent military mobilization has been going on in the city of Athens, and all citizens and foreigners who can fight have been organized (Athens has a large number of foreigners who have settled there for a long time). In Attica, they paid taxes like citizens and even assumed some obligations of military service, but never had the rights of Athenian citizenship) and prepared for defense.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is not only to ensure the safety of the city of Athens, but also the port of Piraeus and the long wall connecting the port and the city.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Several well-known Athenian orators, headed by Isocrates, gave speeches many times in the Agora Market, Dionysus Theater, Athena Square and other crowded places in Athens, motivating citizens and foreigners to defend the city. Athens fought bravely against the Theonian army.
