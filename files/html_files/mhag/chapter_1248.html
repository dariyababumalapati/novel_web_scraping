   Chapter 1248 Strategy against Persia (2)

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors continued: "But according to the recently obtained information, the King of Persia did not fulfill his promise very well, so these city-states have great complaints. In the future, in Asia Minor The fighting Greek coalition will most likely get their support. More than

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   20 years ago, Agesilaus led the Spartan coalition, which was mainly mercenaries, to fight in western Asia Minor and had a long-term advantage. But now the situation in Asia Minor is more favorable to the kingdom , our coalition with the legion as the main body attacking Asia Minor will be more invincible -" "

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Wait a minute, I think there is a problem here." Bagule couldn't help but interjected: "I have seen the map of Persia, the territory of Asia Minor The area is very vast and mostly mountainous. Even if we have an advantage at the beginning, as the army advances eastward, food supply will become a big problem. The land transportation line is too long, and transportation by sea -

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Persians They will never sit idly by. They also have a powerful fleet and will definitely attack our transportation team and cut off the sea transportation lines. In this way, our army will be in trouble..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lord Bagule is right!" Pu Lin Tols replied seriously: "But in fact, attacking Asia Minor is only the first step of our military plan. The next second step is also the most important step, which is to defeat and destroy the Persian fleet!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Kingdom is thousands of miles away from Persia, separated by the vast Eastern Mediterranean. If we want the army to fight on Persian soil without being troubled by logistical supplies, we must control the dominance of the Eastern Mediterranean, especially the Persian Sea. Therefore
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   . , we need to assemble the first, second, third, and fourth fleets, and merge the warships of the allies to form a huge fleet, stationed in the port of Piraeus or Philae, once the Persian fleet moves west Enter, enter the Aegean Sea, and come to attack the transport fleet of the Greek coalition that landed in Asia Minor. Then our combined fleet can take the opportunity to attack and start a decisive battle with the Persian fleet. Once it is defeated, the combined fleet can take advantage of the situation and move eastward... "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka coughed loudly a few times, interrupted Printors' speech, and then asked slowly: "The Persian fleet is also powerful. I would like to ask Lord Printors why the Ministry of Military Affairs is so confident that Can our fleet defeat them?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors said confidently: "Your Majesty! Sirs! After repeated analysis and deductions, our Ministry of Military Affairs believes that the Theonian army has an absolute advantage compared with Persia. Not in the army, but in the navy!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   These words surprised some ministers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors answered confidently: "Persia's main ruling area is inland. It has never been a nation that is good at seafaring. Its fleet is mainly from Phoenicia, Cyprus, Syria, Asia Minor and the Greek coast in Persia. The city-state... is a patchwork of warships and crews provided by them. Due to its complex origins and huge differences in language and culture, it is not easy to knead it into a unified fleet that fully obeys command and dares to fight to the death. This is the reason why in the past, the Greek fleet headed by Athens could always win repeatedly despite having far fewer warships than Persia. However, our fleet acted strictly in accordance with military law, insisted on military training for a long time, had flexible tactics, and fought bravely. It is more powerful than the fleets of Greek city-states.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Secondly, the Persian fleet has hardly participated in major battles for decades and has a serious lack of experience in naval warfare. It is obviously unable to compare with our fleet in this regard. Also, the main force of the Persian fleet is the Philippians. The Nikesâ€”"

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors glanced at Haka who was thinking, and then said: "We had a naval battle with the Phoenician fleet more than 10 years ago, and finally rescued Carthage's Phoenician fleet. Almost the entire army was destroyed. But according to the intelligence we obtained, the Persian fleet did not learn the lessons of this failure. Their naval tactics have not changed much in the past 10 years, and their warships have not improved much. On
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   the contrary, several of our The fleet has been conducting targeted training with Persia as its imaginary opponent in recent years, and has also cooperated with Theonia Academy and shipyards to improve our warships... The number of warships between us and Persia Under similar circumstances, the well-prepared Kingdom Navy has an absolute advantage!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The only shortcoming is that the main station of the Persian fleet is too far away from us, so we have to rely on the Greek coalition's attack in western Asia Minor to lure Persia. The fleet entered the Aegean Sea and completely defeated it!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors waved his fist vigorously and his voice became passionate: "The winning kingdom fleet can seize the opportunity when the strength of the Persian navy is greatly weakened and continue eastward. To advance, either use the ally Egypt as a temporary naval base, or capture the island of Cyprus with the support of Egypt and completely blockade the coasts of Syria and Carthage. Therefore, Egypt is very important to us, and we must maintain it well for the kingdom. friendship and guarantee the stability of its domestic order.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Once we control the Eastern Mediterranean, the kingdom can send its main army consisting of more than a dozen legions to sail eastward without any worries, either docking in Egypt or landing in Canaan , conquered Phoenicia and Syria, entered Mesopotamia, and approached Babylon...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If the Persian army was still fighting the Greek coalition in Asia Minor at this time, it might not have had time to rush back for rescue. Even if the main force of the Egyptian army had not It was sent to Asia Minor and could intercept it in time, but we still had to worry about whether the Greek coalition forces would circle around its rear from the north and form a pincer attack on it together with the main army of the kingdom. In such an unfavorable situation, with the morale at its peak, Our army will engage in a decisive battle, and the Persian army has basically no possibility of victory-" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Persians may not engage in a battle with our army and choose to stick to Babylon.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Asistes reminded: "I heard that Babylon is a huge city, with extremely tall and strong walls, and the wide Euphrates River as a barrier. It cannot be conquered in a short time.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Once the siege continues for too long, our military supplies will be tight, and the Persians may also slow down, causing the situation to change unfavorably for us.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Lord Asistes, you are right. If Persia adopts a defensive strategy, it will indeed cause us more trouble."
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Printors responded euphemistically, he changed his tone and said, "But it will cause even greater trouble to Persia."
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Persia is a big country with vast land, it is not like a kingdom that can effectively govern various regions. Its rule is not too strong. Many regions rely on local races to take care of themselves. Therefore, there was Egypt's independence before, and there was Dukiya. People launched a riot, followed by a rebellion in Asia Minor... Artaxerxes failed to suppress it, resulting in a low prestige, and the nobles and people were not convinced.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Once our army enters the core region of Persia, the plains of Mesopotamia, and the Persian army hides behind high walls and watches us destroying villages and farmland, the local people will definitely be disappointed in Artaxerxes. , which may lead to new rebellions and divisions.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Only by gathering a large army to repel us can he regain the trust of the Persian people, so I think a decisive battle is inevitable!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printols finished roughly explaining the plan drawn up by the Ministry of Affairs, and the hall fell into silence. The ministers looked at me and I looked at you, silently communicating with their eyes, but no one spoke.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a moment, Davos spoke: "Klotokas, what do you think of the Ministry of Military Affairs' plan?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although a few years ago, in mainland Greece, Printors actively assisted Clotokas. Alex finally won the war. Since then, the two have established a friendship and have often communicated with each other after returning to Thurii. But at this time, the kingdom's consul glanced at Printors, and then faced his father, He said calmly: "Your Majesty, the plan formulated by the Ministry of Military Affairs sounds very reasonable. We have a great advantage over Persia. If we follow this plan, we will win easily. But - to fight thousands of miles away, It itself means huge risks. Whether it is the transportation of military supplies or the transmission of news, it will encounter greater difficulties than before. What's more, the attack is a large country with a vast territory. For generals and soldiers, there is no It is a completely unfamiliar land, the situation is complicated, and accidents may happen at any time.

   Just like during the Greek War, we initially hoped to try not to arouse the same hatred of the city-states in Greece. Starting with Sparta, we would conquer the powerful ones one by one. The state eventually took control of the entire Greece. Unexpectedly, the Greek city-states quickly united to form the Greek Alliance to confront us, forcing us to invest more troops, thereby rapidly expanding the war. The reason why the
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   kingdom was able to fight in time at that time The reason for changing the plan and making the right response is that Greece is very close to us. But now Persia is too far away from us. Perhaps when we receive the news and are discussing contingency plans, the army in Persia will encounter new difficulties. They even suffered a defeat, and once they fail, they will face the risk of annihilation. Therefore, I think we should be cautious in using troops against Persia!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, although the political situation in the kingdom is relatively stable now, Master Haka has just said, The mountainous Gauls in the north pose a threat to our territory, and the indigenous people in northern Iberia also harass our southern territory from time to time. The mountainous indigenous people on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea also threaten our Thessaly region and The safety of the Greek allies...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There are still so many insecurities within the kingdom's sphere of influence. In other words, there is still so much land near the kingdom that we need to conquer to ensure the safety of the people of the Holy Kingdom of Theonia. To achieve peace and tranquility, we should focus on doing these things first, and should not be tempted by the wealth of Persia to abandon the near and seek the far."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even if we defeat the Persian army, it will be difficult to conquer the people there and integrate them into the kingdom, because they It is a powerful race that is completely different from us, with a culture and glory that is completely different from ours. They will not be willing to be ruled by us. Perhaps we need to invest huge manpower and material resources to maintain the rule of Persia, but is it worth it? ?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After all, the foundation of the Holy Kingdom of Theonia is in the Western Mediterranean, in Italy-"
