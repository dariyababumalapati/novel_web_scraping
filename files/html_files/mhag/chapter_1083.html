   Chapter 1083 Cloteau and Dido (continued)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Licinius Stolo..." Croteau Catacus is very familiar with this name, because he is now serving as the Roman household registration officer, Stolo. From time to time, he would come to the household registration office to retrieve files or submit a citizen's criminal record. The two parties had many opportunities to interact with each other. He knew that Stolo was able to make impartial decisions in court affairs and rarely made misjudgments. He was very popular among the Roman people. Of course, the welcome is also related to the fact that he is a Roman himself.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax has always believed that as one of the few capable and active Roman citizens of Theonia, this person has a bright future.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Is she here to intercede for Stolo?" After several years of tempering, Crotokatax was no longer as immature as when he first started working, and he immediately thought of the reason why the other party came.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Stolo was invited to the Inspection Office for investigation. Konya was very worried about this, so she came to me crying and said, 'Her husband is devoted to doing things for the kingdom and has never colluded with those former Roman nobles to plot rebellion. ...'She asked me to ask you to speak for her husband, and I agreed." Dido narrated calmly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Are you very familiar with Stroll's wife?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "She has attended several banquets I hosted, and we got to know each other as soon as we went there. How should I put it... She is not exactly a traditional Roman woman, but also has a bit of Roman aristocracy. A woman's cowardice." Dido said seriously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ever since her marriage to Crotocatacus, Dido had lived with him in Rome, but when she was about to give birth, in order to ensure a safe delivery, Christoya strongly urged Dido to go to Turii to give birth, so Dido stayed in Turii for a while and witnessed several gatherings of Turii ladies organized by her mother-in-law. After returning to Rome, she also followed the example, because she had the special characteristics of a prince and concubine. Due to her status, there were many Roman noble ladies who came to the banquet every time, including the wife of the Roman administrator Asistes. In addition, Dido herself was good at dancing, and her banquets gradually became more popular in the entire Roman area. Big reputation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax did not stop it, because this approach would help expand his influence in Rome and meet Davos's requirements.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "During this period, the Turiyi Inspectorate arrested a group of rebels who attempted to assassinate my father at a conference of Greek scholars. Most of them were former Roman nobles. Stolo had a special status and had to interact with these people in the past. , it is normal for him to be investigated. But as far as I know about him, he is a smart man and will not participate in this stupid conspiracy, and his father also admired him in the past... I believe this is just a routine Investigate, he will return home safely soon, and maybe he will be dining at home now." Crotokatax said firmly while eating cod.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I thought so too, so I agreed to her simply. Anyway, we can easily gain their gratitude without any effort from us." Dido blinked her bright eyes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You, you." Clotokatax pretended to be helpless and shook his head. He forked another piece of fried cod and just brought it to his mouth. He thought of something, then put it down again, and said seriously: "Even like Ko Romans with Nia's status will feel uneasy about this arrest. I'm afraid other former Roman noble citizens will be even more worried. I'm worried that this will cause instability in the kingdom!" "I think my
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   father is making this decision. When we arrived, we must have considered this problem and had corresponding measures to deal with it, don't worry!" What Dido said was not a comfort. Since she joined the Kingdom of Theonia, she has deeply felt Dio's feelings in the past few years. Nia's strength today is inseparable from her father-in-law: he was a man of great political wisdom, and he was also very kind to her. During the time he lived in Turiyi, he not only cared about her, but also cared about her. And whenever Christoya criticized him, he would come out to persuade and speak for her...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Mago passed away, she found the shadow of her father in another person.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax agreed with his wife's words. He finished chewing a piece of cod with confidence. Suddenly he remembered something and said softly: "Today I received a letter from my father. In the letter, he asked me to follow Just tell me...the kingdom is going to transfer Sicily Governor Haka back to Thurii."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Ah!" Since experiencing the betrayal of Carthage and the death of his father, Dido thought that he had been able to face everything calmly. But hearing the news still made him a little flustered.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax saw his wife's thoughts, gently squeezed her hand that was resting on the dining table, and said with a smile: "Father does not want to idle Haka, but invites him to come to Thurii to serve as a senator. Rotating President of the Senate."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dido was stunned and then asked: "Who among the five rotating presidents has a vacancy?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It is a seat specially created for him by his father in the Senate, which shows that his father values ​​him!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax heard from his wife that after most of the Magonid family members moved to Iberia, Mago and Hasdrubal were away fighting all the year round, while Dido and Haka were at home. They spend the longest time together, especially during the Western Mediterranean War. The two have to worry about the safety of their loved ones and stabilize the situation in the territory. They comfort and support each other. Although they are just cousins, they are better than real brothers and sisters, so they have a good relationship. , so he continued to comfort his wife and said: "Besides, Haka's health has been poor, and the affairs in southern Iberia are so heavy. Transferring him back to Turiyi will be beneficial to his health. Besides, it can also Closer to us, Chris is already over two years old, and he has never met his uncle!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dido felt a little more relaxed after Crotocatax's explanation, but she saw Seemingly unintentionally, he asked again: "Who will be the new Governor of Sicily?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Father didn't say that in the letter." Clotokatax thought for a while and said with a serious face: "I think father will definitely send A very capable senator came to take over. In the past year, the Iberian territory has been frequently invaded by indigenous people. This has a lot to do with the inaction of local officials. It needs to be rectified. We don't want to see it. The area that your father spent 10 years conquering finally became a paradise for the indigenous people!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dido was silent for a moment, then relaxed his brows and said softly: "Cloteau, you are right. Since Iberia The southern region has become the territory of the Kingdom of Theonia, so it should be left to the kingdom to govern with confidence... Do you still need to serve you a bowl of soup?" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I'm full." Clotokatax cut the knife As soon as the fork was placed on the dining table, the servants rushed over to clean it up.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Cloteau." Dido asked softly again: "When can we return to Thurii?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This... still needs my father to decide..." Crotokartax's desire to go home is not very strong, mainly because he is more free here, and his efforts have been recognized by many people. , which gave him a sense of accomplishment, so he thought for a while and said: "My father left me here because he hoped that through my efforts, the people here would identify more with the Kingdom of Theonia and support our royal family. I have not done enough. , I may need to stay here for a few more years...I am still just a Roman household registration official, maybe when I become the governor of the Roman city, I will not be far from going home."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ………… …………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As Crotocatacus said, the "arrest of a group of former Roman nobles" spread in the kingdom, which indeed made some Roman citizens in the Kingdom of Theonia feel They were nervous, but soon they got the news: Sextus became the commander of the legion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Immediately afterwards, a bigger news shocked them: the rotating chairman Lysias resigned from the position of administrator of Thurii and was replaced by Manlius Publius, a former Roman noble and current Theonian senator.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thurii is the center of the kingdom, and its chief executive position is far more important and powerful than other towns in the kingdom. It must be a senator trusted by King Davos.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And this new news strongly proves: this arrest operation is not to purge members of the former Roman aristocracy, but indeed these people are plotting rebellion. King Davos still trusts and is willing to reuse former Roman aristocratic citizens.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The appointment of Publius as the administrator of Thurii was also a major event in the political arena of the kingdom. Publius, who had always kept a low profile and had never served as administrator, was suddenly nominated by Lysias who had resigned. , which not only surprised many elders, but also encountered strong opposition from them.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But with the full support of Davos, he finally took this important position.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even after the dust settled, the senators still had a lot of criticism, but soon their attention was attracted by another major event: the death of Finance Minister Melses.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the establishment of Theonia, Melses has been in control of the country's financial power. Although many elders have had disputes with him over money issues, they all have to admit that it was precisely under his strict and shrewd attitude that he Under his management, the kingdom managed to survive several life-and-death and costly wars without leading to financial collapse. Only then did the kingdom become as strong as it is today.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, they were not worried that the death of Melses would cause chaos in the kingdom's financial and taxation management. In fact, his successor had already surfaced.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   During the period when he was ill and bedridden, Archibides received his recommendation and the king's support, and he performed brilliantly in the position of acting minister of finance. Many people believed that he would officially take over this important position in the kingdom. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the few days since Melses' body lay dormant, King Davos and his wife, five rotating presidents, ministers of various departments, elders, officials at all levels of the kingdom, and even many people in Thurii went to pay homage. There were long queues of people waiting in front of the mansion where he lived. Merses's life was not even as good as it was in the past few days after his death.
