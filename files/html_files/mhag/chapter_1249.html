   Chapter 1249 Davos's Wish
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The foundation of the Holy Kingdom of Theonia is in the Western Mediterranean and in Italy!" Davos did not show dissatisfaction because his son opposed launching a war against Persia. Instead, he laughed and looked towards The son's eyes were full of relief: "Klotokatax, I hope you will remember what you just said, and let your descendants remember it in the future, and concentrate on governing the Western Mediterranean. Only the Holy Kingdom of Onia can have long-term peace and stability!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes!" Crotokatax responded respectfully.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "But Theonia wants to attack Persia, not because of its wealth and land, but to change from passive to active, seize the favorable opportunity when its national power is weak, and defeat it completely. At that time, depending on the situation, or Support a few puppets in Persia, or split it into multiple countries to reduce the threat to the kingdom... These methods should be more effective and less laborious than directly annexing the land."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos said calmly: " As for the difficulties you mentioned about attacking Persia, which war in Theonia has experienced in the past did not have difficulties or accidents! It's just that the difficulties in facing Persia are greater. And we in Theonia Why are we able to win and defeat our opponents every time? It is because we attach great importance to every opponent and have careful planning and preparation, so we have more advantages. Since the

   establishment of the kingdom, the only strong enemy left in the entire Mediterranean is Persia. Artaxerxes and I both understood that there would be a war between the two sides, so he would instigate the Greek city-states to unite against us. When the rebellion broke out in Asia Minor, I had thought about sending troops to attack the Persian mainland, but at that time The Greek war has just ended, our military food and supplies have been consumed a lot, the Greek alliance has just been established and needs to be consolidated, Thessaly has just been conquered, and it still needs time to digest... so I had to cancel this idea. But

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   the Ministry of Military Affairs has always regarded Persia as the leader. Target, in the past few years, we have been conducting military training and improving weapons and equipment against Persia, and we have accumulated many advantages over Persia today. Therefore, the attack plan against Persia cannot be delayed any longer! I believe - with the
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   blessing of Hades, We will definitely win in the end!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Davos said categorically, Cedorom understood completely in his heart: Sure enough, the attack on Persia was the intention of His Majesty Davos, and he just asked the Ministry of Military Affairs to propose it. Even He may have discussed it with Bagulu and Asistes in advance and performed a play with everyone in the palace hall.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thedorum glanced at Olivers and Printols, then at Bagule and Asistes, then lowered his eyes and remained silent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, Davos let out a long sigh and said in a low tone: "Yesterday, I went to visit Amintas. Due to the recurrence of his old injury, he could no longer sit or stand at all. He could only lie on the bed and talk to me... …He talked to me about many past events, especially his adventures in Persia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He said, ‘He has gone from being a homeless refugee to becoming an important minister of a powerful kingdom in the Mediterranean. He doesn't have many regrets in this life. The only regret is that…maybe We can no longer see the Theonian army attacking Persia, taking back the bones of our mercenary companions who died in foreign lands in the past, and taking revenge on the Persians who chased us like cattle and sheep..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Speaking of this, Davos He sighed deeply again and said: "...Amintas' words touched me a lot!...I still clearly remember that we went through all the troubles to escape from Persia and rested in Byzantium. Burkos, are you still here? Remember? You came all the way to Byzantium and wanted to hire us to go to Thurii to fight against the Lucarians. I agreed—"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Minister of Agriculture Burkos stood up tremblingly, quite excited. Said: "Your Majesty, of course I remember! I heard that a Greek mercenary army fought thousands of miles in Persia and successfully returned to the Aegean Sea. Therefore, I believe that as long as this army can be hired, it will be able to defeat the Lucanians, but hiring The military leaders rejected my invitation one after another. Just when I was about to feel desperate, it was Your Majesty who agreed to my request without hesitation and gave me hope! But who could have thought that this small invitation would actually create a powerful person? Kingdom, changed the pattern of the entire Mediterranean!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos recalled the past with emotion: "Yeah, no one can predict the world a few decades later... So at that time the Spartan army and the Byzantines were afraid to accept We who were invited by Thurii took the opportunity to cause trouble and made harsh demands. 'Unless we take off our armor, lay down our weapons, and enter the Byzantine city naked, we will not be allowed to leave by boat at the port.'
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The former leaders of the mercenaries once went to Persia for I blindly believed in the words of the Persian general and entered the Persian camp to negotiate with my bare hands. As a result, I was brutally killed. Therefore, the mercenaries were deeply wary of this. For this reason, I struggled to convince them... and on that day, we laid down our weapons. When I walked into Byzantium, I was humiliated in every possible way by the Spartans and Byzantines. The road leading to the port was really difficult!..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty, I remember the events of that day very clearly!" His eyes were a little moist. Olivers gritted his teeth and said: "They called us vile bastards and told us to get out of Byzantium and not pollute their land. Some people also threatened that if we didn't run faster, they would chop our bodies into pieces. Break them into pieces and feed them to the dogs... They not only scolded us, but also threw all kinds of debris at us!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I was standing next to your Majesty at the time, and I saw with my own eyes that you were hit by a few rotten fruits, and your face was a little swollen. But he endured it... After we got on the ship, many people were very angry and swore in the name of the gods that one day they would return the humiliation they suffered to the Byzantines!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Kolotoka This was the first time that Tuckers heard his father talk about the bitter past decades ago. He clenched his fists in sympathy and was about to say something.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, Davos's eyes quickly swept from Olivers and Alps, who looked sad and angry, and then looked at the other people with solemn expressions. He said in a serious tone: "It is these people who have gone through hardships and been spurned by others. The mercenaries came to Magna Graecia in embarrassment, fought bloody battles, and finally had the powerful Holy Kingdom of Theonia today! They are the founders of the kingdom, but we owe them an explanation!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Melses, Ci Peter, Xantiparis... they have already left this world, and Amyntas, Alexis, Philisius... I am afraid they will follow in their footsteps in a few years. Are these kingdoms going to be allowed to do so? The heroes all went to the Elysee with regret!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What's more, among the Theonian army, they are the most familiar with the combat characteristics of the Persian army, and they are also the most familiar with the geography and customs of Persia. Shouldn't we take advantage of them? Some of the people were still barely able to wear armor and go into battle, launching an attack on Persia in time, which not only solved the hidden dangers of the kingdom, but also fulfilled their wishes!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Elites of the kingdom, if you agree or disagree, please give your opinions immediately!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Main Hall After a brief silence, Clotocathus, Asistes, Sipulus, Antaoris, Haka, Bagule and many other ministers rushed to respond loudly: "Your Majesty, I agree with the Kingdom Declare war on Persia after the Games!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Okay! Okay! Okay!" Davos looked at the excited Olivers, Asistes and others, stood up suddenly, and said loudly: "Since everyone agrees, then the attack on Persia is settled. "!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He paused and then said: "I read the report of the Games organizing team. The city-states of the Greek Union that accepted the invitation will send their most important officials to participate. It is a good opportunity to hold a Greek Games. The high-level meeting of the alliance reached an agreement with them to form a coalition to jointly deal with Persia! Leave this matter to Tapirus to arrange." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Yes, Your Majesty!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After deciding on the most important thing, Dai Firth looked at his son again and said in a deep voice: "Klotokatax, the questions you just mentioned about the expedition to Persia are too far away and the kingdom cannot get the latest news from the battlefield in a timely manner. , and cannot convey new instructions in a timely manner, and the leading generals dare not make decisions without authorization in the face of complex situations... Wait, these problems do deserve our attention, but the solution to the problems is also very simple, that is, I personally lead the troops on the expedition. !"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone was shocked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Cedorum blurted out: "Your Majesty, this is absolutely impossible -"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What's wrong!" Davos interrupted him with a stiff tone, and said with confidence: "Since I came to Magna Graecia and personally led the troops, I have successively Conquering Lucania, Crotone, Syracuse, Messape, Pucetti, Rome, and Carthage, and winning one victory after another, helped the kingdom get through the most difficult period, and gradually Becoming stronger...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The war that is about to begin with Persia is of undoubted importance to the kingdom. It is related to the life and death of hundreds of thousands of soldiers and the rise and fall of the kingdom. Who else but me can take on such an important mission and have the confidence to do so? Get the final victory?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Some shrewd ministers heard the implication of Davos' words: Theonia will use all the forces of the kingdom to attack Persia, and put such a huge force into the hands of a certain general. There is some uneasiness.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What's more, after the victory, great glory was bestowed on the generals who led the army, which made this uneasiness even greater... Therefore, it is safest for the king to lead the army in person.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course Clotokatax was also aware of this problem, but he still suggested with concern: "The environment and climate in Persia are different from those in the Kingdom. This is another thousand-mile campaign, which will definitely be more tiring. Your Majesty...Father, how old are you?" The situation is too high and we should not go on such a difficult expedition again. Let me go on your behalf!"
