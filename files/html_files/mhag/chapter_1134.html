   Chapter 1134 Daedi Alliance
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos coughed lightly and said seriously: "Pelopidas, someone told me that Thebes can regain its independence and be able to fight against the Spartans for many years, with a slight Occupying the advantage, you played an important role in it!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pelopidas was refreshed. He felt a hint of kindness revealed by Davos in these words, and immediately replied humbly: "Thebes What we are today is the result of the joint efforts of all the citizens who love Thebes. I just exerted all my strength like them. And what I have done is compared with the powerful kingdom you created. , not worth mentioning at all."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You are too modest." Davos smiled slightly. Apart from Plato, this was the first time he heard a powerful figure in Greece give him such a high evaluation. He felt slightly complacent in his heart, so he lightly Patting the armrest, he asked, "Why did you come to Thurii this time?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty the King." Pelopidas said solemnly: "Ten days ago, Thebes was invited. Go to Sparta to negotiate an armistice. The war has lasted for so many years, the land of Thebes has been wantonly destroyed by the Spartans, and the people's lives are very difficult. We are very willing to stop the war and restore peace.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But during the negotiations Athens betrayed us. They joined forces with the Spartans, with strong support from the Persians, to jointly put pressure on us and force us to dissolve the Boeotian League. However, their own alliance was obtained through such a contract. To retain..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pelopidas briefly described the general content of the contract, and then said angrily: "Our envoys withstood the pressure and did not sign the contract, because once they agreed to their demands, they would be disbanded. League of Boeotia, if Sparta breaks the contract again and attacks Thebes, we will not be able to fight against it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Due to our refusal, the Persians threatened us that they would fully support Sparta, Severely punish Thebes... So today I came to Thurii to seek support from Theonia on behalf of Thebes!" After
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pelopidas finished speaking, he saw Davos sitting firmly on the throne, Putting his hand on his chin, he pondered and said nothing, so he continued: "Before this peace negotiation, because I heard that both Sparta and Athens sent people to Persia to seek support, I also went to Babylon as an envoy from Thebes. And was summoned by the King of Persia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In front of our three envoys, the King of Persia clearly asked us to stop the war, and also said, 'Theonia has ambitions for Greece, and only the Greek city-states can resist it if they unite The invasion of the Theonian army...'That's why the King of Persia sent an envoy to vigorously promote the peace talks in Sparta."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos's heart moved: He didn't think that Pelopidas was seeking Theonian support. And lying, because what he said also confirmed why Persia had to let Sparta end the peace agreement with Theonia early. It seems that the Persians have begun to play games against Theonia!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thinking of this, Davos looked at Pelopidas and said slowly: "So do you Thebans think Theonia is a threat to Greece?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I think what the King of Persia said is simply a joke!" Pelopidas said angrily: "The Persians are a foreign race. Since the beginning of the Greco-Persian War, they have been dreaming of annexing Greek land and enslaving the Greek people. In the past few decades, It has never stopped interfering in the political situation of mainland Greece. Nowadays, Greece has constant wars and has a lot to do with Persia. Theonia is a kingdom mainly formed by Greeks. It has lived in harmony with mainland Greece since its establishment. Any conflict or war. Who is better and who is worse can be known by comparing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   That's why I came to ask your noble king to lend a helping hand to help Thebes fight against the coalition forces of Persia and Sparta, so that the various city-states in Greece can regain their Freedom and peace are no longer under their control! If Theonia does this, it will not only crush the Persians' series of conspiracies against Theonia in advance, but also allow Theonia to win prestige and the majority in Greece The support of the city-state!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos nodded while showing an embarrassed look: "What you said makes some sense, but... Theonia and Sparta have been in friendly contact for more than ten years. The Bada envoy said, 'They will not be punished for ending the friendly agreement early -'"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty the King!" Pelopidas immediately persuaded: "Theonia keeps its promise and is famous in the Mediterranean. It's admirable! But during the more than 10 years that you have conscientiously implemented the friendly agreement with Sparta, what did the Spartans do?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As far as I know, they violated the agreement and secretly cooperated with Syracuse. Keep in touch with Zha, and take the initiative to take in some of the remaining forces of Greater Greece that hate Theonia. During your war with Carthage, these forces also formed armies and invaded the territory of Theonia. It is difficult to say that there is no Spartan among them. The instructions of the master...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Spartans are insidious and cunning. As long as it is beneficial to them, they will do whatever it takes. This is true for Thebes and the same is true for Theonia. To speak faith with them is like a cow or a sheep. Against the evil wolves, we are always the ones who suffer!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And it has been almost a month since the Spartans tore up the agreement with Theonia. In this month, you have not taken any hostile actions against Sparta, which can be regarded as The promise has been fulfilled. In addition, because of this truce negotiation, the war between Thebes and Sparta has stopped for a while, and peace has appeared in the eyes of the Greek people.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If Theonia and Thebes form an alliance , Sparta also launched another attack on Thebes, which will let the Greek people know more clearly who the real perpetrators of the war are, and will also let the Theonian people see more clearly how the Spartans treat them. Theonia, which has been friendly for more than 10 years! Of course, if they can take Theonia into consideration and really restore peace in Greece, I think it will be a good thing for everyone!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos sighed and said, "It seems that it is true that you were treated favorably by the King of Persia when you visited Persia. You are indeed very persuasive."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pelopidas felt happy in his heart, but responded humbly: "That's because what I said is true. ."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos finally said seriously: "In this case, I agree that the Kingdom of Theonia and Thebes will form a military alliance. I hope that this time our sincere efforts will be treated sincerely by each other!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Pelopidas was somewhat confident in gaining the support of Theonia, he did not expect that the king of Theonia would be willing to form a military alliance with Thebes. It was suddenly difficult to suppress the joy in his heart, and his face was filled with tears. It was a smile.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Soon, Theonian Foreign Minister Ansitanos and Pelopidas began to discuss alliance matters.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   One day later, Ansitanos came to the palace and reported the situation to Davos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Pelopidas Si hopes that our Theonia will support Thebes in unifying the Boeotian region?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Davos frowned.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Your Majesty. It seems that the Thebans have a strong obsession with this. I heard that when they were conducting contract negotiations in Sparta, it was because Sparta forced them to dissolve the Thebes Alliance that the negotiations took place. Rupture..." Ansitanos reminded tactfully.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos tapped the wooden table with his hand, pondered for a while, and said, "Promise him."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before Ansitanos could respond, Henipolis on the side asked with some doubts: "Your Majesty, from now on Judging from the current situation, Sparta will definitely launch another attack on Thebes. Our alliance with Thebes at this time has already given the Thebes huge support, and now we have to help them unify the skin. Osha, is this a little bit..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "A little too high a view of Thebes?" Davos took over his words and said seriously: "Henny, you should take a longer view, don't Just focusing on this small benefit in front of us, even if the Thebans really unified the Boeotia region, the land area would only be the same as that of Messape, Pucetti and other regions, and it would not cause any harm to us. Threat. But in order to achieve this goal, the Thebans dared to confront Sparta, Athens, and Persia. This shows how important it is to the Thebans! If we can help them, they will naturally be doubly grateful. This It will be of great help to us to gain a foothold in Greece in the future!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not to mention, making our allies stronger and able to compete with Greek powers such as Athens and Sparta will be very helpful for us Theonia to enter Greece in the future. It is more helpful and conducive to the stability of the local order in Greece..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, you have to think long-term!" Henipolis praised loudly and sincerely.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos did not accept this, pointed at Ansitanos, and said, "You just didn't think carefully. When your teacher came to report to me, he had already considered these pros and cons clearly, and understood it in his heart. La."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Henipolis immediately looked at Ansitanos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ansitanos said calmly: "Your Majesty, Henipolis is not a foreign ministry official. He cannot understand the intricate relationships among the Greek city-states in detail, nor can he think about how to get benefits from them every day like us. He How is it possible to make a very correct judgment..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Henny, do you see, your teacher still cares about you." Davos said jokingly, with a smile on his face. He suddenly remembered something again, seriously. Said: "But you are right just now. Theonia has given Thebes such great support and should receive more rewards. Ansitanos, when your Ministry of Foreign Affairs negotiated with Pelopidas , additional requirements can be added to the covenant, for example, when Theonia takes military action in mainland Greece, Thebes must provide full support, etc..."
