   Chapter 1220: Confrontation at Thermopylae

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Iphicrates nodded happily. Jason's statement at least showed that his efforts were not in vain.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He looked at the Thessaly military camp, which was already filled with flames. Countless torches poured out of the camp gate, extending to the north, gradually forming a winding fire dragon...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Iphicrates prayed silently with a solemn expression: May Athena bless you. , all the best for the Thessalians!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As the Thessalian army's departure caused military morale to fluctuate, the Greek coalition forces closed their camps in the following days. At the same time, out of fear, they were not allowed to leave. Not strengthening defenses.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While Iphicrates was busy appeasing the coalition generals and soldiers, he also sent people to notify the allies in the Peloponnese and warned them to strengthen their defenses.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As he expected, Crotokatax, who had discovered the enemy's situation, sent the first legion quickly north from Sparta on the advice of Printors and attacked the part of Greece that besieged Mantinia. The Greek coalition forces, which had been ordered by Iphicrates, retreated voluntarily, and Mantinia was temporarily freed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The 1st Army, which failed to fight the Greek coalition forces, continued northward, heading straight to Corinth on the isthmus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After receiving the news, Iphicrates did not lead the army to rescue. Instead, he allowed the main force of the coalition forces to continue to stay in the Leprion camp, and at the same time assumed a posture of launching an attack on the Theonian camp in Messenia at any time, forcing Theonia did not dare to easily transfer its troops in Messenia. Only the Greek coalition forces that had previously besieged Mandinia followed the First Army. But once the First Army turned to attack it, they quickly avoided it.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But their presence prevented the First Army from launching an attack on the seemingly well-defended city of Corinth.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Two days later, the First Army, which failed to achieve its purpose of mobilizing the main force of the Greek coalition forces, did not dare to stay in a completely unfamiliar enemy territory for a long time. In addition, the rations it carried had been consumed a lot, so it turned around and returned south again, returning to Lagnia. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ……………………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just when the battle in the Peloponnese temporarily subsided and the two sides presented a strange confrontation, Jason had already led the army through Landing in the Gulf of Corinth at Chleusis in Thebes, we quickly headed north, passing through the Boeotian region and entering the Phokis region.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, the Phokis people no longer reject the Thessalians as much as they did a few months ago. After all, the two sides are now allies, and Phokis faces the threat of the Theonian army stationed in the north and urgently needs the Thessalian army. With help, the Thessalian army was welcomed by the Phocians, and Greek reinforcements generals came to greet them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After some discussions, Jason had a general understanding of the situation in the north: the Theonian army occupied Heraclea, and at the same time captured Thermopylae, and for a time continued southward and surrounded the city of Kittenion. Fortunately, With the timely reinforcements from the Athenians in advance, the Phocians repelled the attacks of the Theonian army several times. Yesterday, the Theonians may have found out the news about the return of the Thessalian army, and had already arrived from Kittenion. Withdraw and return.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After some consideration, Jason decided to lead his army north along the coast, first capture Thermopylae, and then enter the Lamia region. The reason for making such a choice was that he considered that the mountainous areas in northern Central Greece were more difficult to trek. It is conducive to the march of the army, and the Theonian army also occupied Heraclea and guarded the northern gate of the mountain. He has seen the defensive capabilities of the Theonian army in the Peloponnese. Once it cannot conquer Heracles in time, Leah, it is extremely dangerous for tens of thousands of troops to be blocked in the mountains.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Jason knew very well that although Thermopylae was famous in Greece for being easy to defend and difficult to attack, the Greeks originally built this pass to defend against the barbarians in the north (mainly Thessaly). Therefore, it was designed to defend against the north but not the south. It was just a It is a single-sided pass, which is why the Persian army could easily capture the Thermopylae after sending surprise troops to bypass the Thermopylae via the trail. Therefore, the Thessalian army attacked directly from the south and should be able to capture the pass relatively easily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But when Jason led his army to the steamy coast, he was dumbfounded: a Theonian military camp stood in front, stuck between the mountains and the seaside cliffs, and behind it was the familiar stone wall of Hot Spring Pass. ...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It turns out that before, Efialt led the main force of the legion to attack Thermopylae at the same time from both front and odd sides. Although the defenders of Thermopylae were also on guard against the mountain road, they had too few troops after all. After a day of fighting, the 12th Legion successfully occupied the pass. Went to Hot Spring Pass.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a result, Effialt quickly discovered the flaws of this pass. The main task of the Twelfth Army was to block the returning Thessalian army, but Thermopylae was unable to defend against enemies coming from the south.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But this couldn't help Efialt. After all, the terrain here at Thermopylae was narrow and superior troops could not be deployed. It was conducive to defending more with less. This feature was the same for the south and the north, so he called the engineering battalion and commanded more than half of the troops. The soldiers built a camp close to Thermopylae, and he led 3,000 soldiers from the coast to the inland, surveying the terrain along the way, and after discovering the city of Kinnion, he quickly surrounded it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, his purpose of doing this was no longer to expand the results, but to attract the enemy's attention and ensure the smooth construction of the camp.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now, Jason felt a headache looking at the Theonian camp ahead. His army had suffered enough from attacking the Theonian camp in Peloponnese, but at this moment he could not retreat and could only break through with all his strength. Only in this camp can we return to Thessaly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the order to attack was given, the Thessalian soldiers who were eager to return home were divided into teams and continued to attack the Theonia camp along the narrow coast.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the Greco-Persian War a hundred years ago, a bloody battle on a grand scale broke out again near Thermopylae.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, compared to the Spartan army that guarded this place a hundred years ago, the Theonian army on the defensive side at this time has more advantages.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The first is that Theonia's defensive strength is not at an absolute disadvantage.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The 12th Legion has 8,000 soldiers, and in order to prevent accidents, Efialt also forced Lamia, which had surrendered to Theonia, to recruit 1,000 citizen soldiers in advance as a reserve force to defend Thermopylae.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition to the 1,000 Theonian Legion soldiers stationed in Lamia Acropolis and Heraclea, which cannot be mobilized, Ephialt can have 7,000 soldiers in the battle. These soldiers will continue to pass through Thermopylae and enter the camp. , take turns participating in defensive operations.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, after this period of fighting in the Peloponnese, the Thessalian army had been reduced from the initial 40,000 to more than 36,000. The strength was only more than four times that of the defenders. Unlike the Persian army back then, Up to hundreds of thousands.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Secondly, Ephialt learned the lessons of the Spartan army and built small defense facilities on several known mountain trails, guarded by Samnite soldiers who were good at mountain warfare to prevent sneak attacks by the Thessalians. .
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Moreover, the 12th Legion has a variety of arms. Heavy infantry, light armor, javelin soldiers, and archers are reasonably matched with each other. They can defend the narrow coastal camp and effectively curb the Thessalian attack.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, Effialt also asked the soldiers to move several ballistas from the legion to the head of Thermopylae. The stone projectiles fired could fly over the camp and inflict maximum damage to the intensively attacking Thessalian soldiers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, the Thessalian army launched a fierce attack on the camp for several days, but not only had little effect, but also suffered a lot of casualties.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just when Jason in the rear was anxious because he could not break through the Theonian defense line, the Thessalian soldiers who were once again preparing to attack the camp were shocked to see the wooden door of the camp suddenly opened, and dozens of people came out. A Thessaly man in civilian clothes shouted that he was so-and-so from a certain city-state in Thessaly, and at the same time asked to meet with the citizen soldiers of his own city-state.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It turned out that when Jason led his army to approach Thermopylae, Effialt immediately sent a messenger to Thessaly to inform the commander-in-chief Patroclus that the main force in Thessaly had returned.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, more than half a month had passed since the landing army conquered Philae and forced the surrender of Pharsalus. Since the main power in Thessaly had been controlled by the Theonian army, the landing army continued to divide its troops and plunder the land. The general situation was gone. The city-states of Surrey either surrendered or were conquered, so during this period the Theonian army basically conquered the southern and northern plains of Thessaly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The army was advancing in triumph, and the officials under the leadership of Hilos, the administrator of Thessaly region, were also working intensively.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While promising to provide benefits to civilians, they also attracted celebrities from various city-states. In addition, they were all born in Thessaly. Many people in Thessaly began to accept them, so there was a saying that soon spread in Thessaly. Rumor has it that King Theonia is a Thessaly and a descendant of Hades. Compared with the tyrant Jason, he is more capable of protecting Thessaly and is more suitable to serve as Thessaly Tagus. ...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, the legendary story of "Davos founded the Kingdom of Theonia and the rapid rise of the Kingdom of Theonia" also began to spread among the people of Thessaly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After receiving the news from Ephialt, Patroclus was well prepared. He immediately asked Hilos, who was already handling the entire Thessalian affairs in Philae, to help summon all the Thessalians who had surrendered to the Kingdom of Theonia. The prestigious council members of the city-state then told them clearly: Jason was leading the army back, and Theonia was preparing to gather a hundred thousand troops in Thessaly to completely defeat it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Many of these councilors from the Thessaly city-state have witnessed Theonia's huge army and their terrifying combat effectiveness. Although the number of troops led by Jason is also large, most of them do not think that Jason Be able to win in the end.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   They were very worried about this.
