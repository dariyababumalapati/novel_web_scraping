   Since the establishment of Theonia, large-scale battles like this have only occurred twice. In the Western Mediterranean War, King Davos personally led the main force to fight the Carthaginian army in Sicily. But in that war, some of the soldiers were provided by the allies, so the 100,000 soldiers were mixed with a lot of water; secondly, in the Gallic War, Leoticides led a large army to conquer Alpine Gaul, but in fact other The main force led by himself did not number 100,000. Counting the partial army led by Patroclus, it only exceeded 100,000.

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, this time it is really a landing operation of 100,000 troops composed of the regular Theonian army (the Balearic slingers belong to the special Theonian army, have a formal establishment in the Ministry of Military Affairs, and are usually stationed in Ibi. The training of the Eighteenth Legion in the Iberian region, and occasionally participating in combat against the Iberian natives; the Gallic Brigade is also a regular force, and the Ministry of Military Affairs refers to the former Roman Reserve Brigade, hoping that through time, it will eventually be Transformed into a regular army, it has been trained and commanded by the 14th Army stationed in the Po River area, and has also participated in the war against the Ligurians with the Border Army. Today, Liguria is still resisting except for sporadic places. It has basically been pacified, and the Gallic army has contributed a lot), and Patroclus can command such a large army to carry out such an important battle at such a young age. This is really enviable!

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Olivers, Tagetinos and other generals looked at Patroclus who was talking eloquently, and felt very envious and jealous in their hearts, but there was no trace of disdain. After all, Patroclus made many brilliant plans in Etruria. The deeds of annihilating the invading Roman army in a short period of time were amazing. After that, he led his army to station in Alpine Gaul. In a few years, he not only stabilized the Po River area, but also almost conquered Liguria... Therefore, he was able to become the commander of the landing operations because of his outstanding command skills and past achievements, not because he was the son-in-law of King Davos.

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors did not have these complicated thoughts. He was focused on the upcoming landing operation. He frowned and continued to ask: "100,000 soldiers will need at least 2,000 ships to transport them, and there are still many landing places." There are many islands on the east coast of Greece and the coastline is tortuous. How can we reach the landing site as quickly and accurately as possible? How can we ensure the safety of the fleet at sea?..." "Let

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   me answer these questions." Sekeli An took over without hesitation: "The maritime support for this landing operation is handled by me, Midorades and Stefankas. The 1st Fleet, 2nd Fleet and 3rd Fleet, a total of 1,200 A warship will escort all fleets transporting soldiers and supplies and participate in combat at the appropriate time.

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Today, there are only two city-states in the Greek alliance that may cause trouble for transport fleets, Athens and Thessaly. According to intelligence, The Athenian navy has more than 80 warships, including 50 triremes. Recently, due to the support of its maritime allies, the number may have exceeded 100. The Athenian navy has relatively strong tactical capabilities, high ship handling skills, and is aggressive. Seven days ago, the main force of our navy was on the west coast to assist the army in conquering the island. The Athenian fleet actually quietly approached the Gulf of Lagnia and fought with the 1st Squadron of the 1st Fleet that stayed behind. Since the Athenians were not familiar with our tactics, lost several warships, and later took the initiative to retreat. This was also a small victory for our navy...

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Thessaly fleet only started to be formed a few years ago, but it is said that Jason invested a lot in it, There are nearly a hundred warships now, but they have never engaged in any major battles. So far, our intelligence personnel have never seen this fleet patrolling the sea. A fleet that likes to stay in the port does not have the capabilities. combat effectiveness.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, based on the analysis of the enemy's situation, our navy made the following combat deployment on the day of landing. The 2nd Fleet and 3rd Fleet left the port before the departure of the transport fleet, and the warships of the 2nd Fleet blocked Salon Bay. The Third Fleet blocked the Gulf of Pagasa (the bay east of Thessaly) to prevent the warships of Athens and Thessaly from going out to sea to attack the transport fleet. The five squadrons of the 1st Fleet respectively escorted each transport fleet to land. Land -"

   Sekerian said here, swallowed, moistened his throat, and continued: "In addition, I want to talk about the transport fleet that landed this time. The Ministry of Military Affairs arrived in the Kingdom a month ago When each port town recruits transport ships, they deliberately choose merchant ships that are familiar with the coastal routes of Northern Greece. The chambers of commerce in each region provide a lot of help in this regard, so there is no need to worry about the crew being unfamiliar with the routes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Moreover, the Ministry of Military Affairs also spends time These more than 2,000 transport merchant ships have been formed into a formation, their respective tasks have been clarified, and unified training has been carried out, so there is no need to worry about too much chaos in the fleet when landing. This season, the

 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   south wind blows in the Aegean Sea. If there are more days, we will choose the stronger day in the south as the landing day. According to my judgment, it may only take half a day for the entire fleet to reach its destination."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors listened carefully and frowned. The raised brows did not completely relax: "Our huge fleet may face more threats when sailing north than the navy of Athens and Thessaly -" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I know Lord Printors is talking about the Persian navy.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This time it was Midorades who interrupted. He and Sekerian looked at each other and said with a smile: "We have not taken the Persian Navy lightly. Since the First Fleet was stationed in the waters south of the Peloponnese, They have been sending clippers to monitor the movements of the Persian fleet in various areas of Asia Minor, and so far no abnormalities have been found.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After our 2nd Fleet returned from Egypt, we sent additional clippers to the waters near Crete to strengthen observation of the Phoenician waters. Judging from the news we have now received, the Persians have begun to launch an attack on Egypt. A large number of warships are concentrated in Tire and Sidon in Phoenicia, and there is no sign of a large-scale march westward to aid Greece.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing this
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   , Printols asked with some concern: "100,000 soldiers consume a huge amount of military rations every day. How will you solve the problem after landing?"
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Patroclus replied without hesitation: "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Ministry of Military Affairs requires that each soldier must carry 5 days of rations. After a successful landing, we must occupy nearby port towns, such as Lamia and Peleus, as soon as possible to ensure that we carry Material ships can enter the port to unload their cargo.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, this is only temporary. The base that can really conveniently provide logistics supplies for the entire army should be Philae.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   According to the information we have received, a large amount of food has been stored in the city of Philae, which is prepared for Jason's army. Therefore, our landing army must break into the hinterland of Thessaly as soon as possible and capture Philae as soon as possible.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A smile appeared on the corner of Patroclus's mouth, and he said confidently: "Your Majesty also attaches great importance to Philae. He has made some arrangements in advance. I believe it will be of great help in successfully capturing Philae.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is now the end of July, and it will be August when we attack. The wheat is almost ripe, and Thessaly has a large number of fertile wheat fields, which can fully supply our military rations for the next few months..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Only then did Printors look a little brighter. He looked at the generals who had just arrived in Sparta and said seriously: "It seems that His Majesty attaches great importance to this landing operation and has asked the Ministry of Military Affairs to do a lot of work." More preparations. I believe you have also led the legion to conduct many landing operations. I no longer have any doubts. I just hope that you will continue to pay close attention to the trends in the Aegean Sea in the next few days, and then based on the actual situation Perfect your landing plan."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors obviously said these words as chief of staff, and Patroclus and other generals nodded seriously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then Patroclus looked at Clotocathacus and asked with concern: "Whether the landing in Thessaly is successful or not, whether it can be defended here is the key. I heard that you suffered a lot of losses in the battle with Sparta. , and now we are facing a large-scale attack by the Greek coalition forces. Are we a little tight in terms of military strength? Do you need me to detach some troops to support you?" After more than
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   two months of fighting in the Peloponnese, Clotokatak Sparta no longer lacked self-confidence at first and had to consult with Printors before making any decision. He answered confidently: "Actually, we did not lose much in the battle with Sparta. We lost 4 legions and one cavalry. The legion is still very complete. In addition, we can also organize about 15,000 young Helots and Pileasians from Messenia and Laconia. The total force can reach 45,000 people, and the Greek coalition forces The difference is not too big.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What's more, they are attacking and we are defending, and their troops are completely sufficient. And judging from the previous battle conditions, the Greek coalition is not good at siege. Their siege equipment is simple and their methods are simple. Even if the battle is not brave enough, it does not pose a great threat to our defensive camps. In fact, even without your landing operation, we are confident that we will hold on until the morale of the Greek coalition forces is low and they finally have to retreat." When
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Patroclus heard this, he suddenly Frowning, he reminded directly: "I suggest you not to defend too hard, but also make some concessions appropriately, so that the Greek coalition forces can taste the sweetness and not want to retreat. We need to contain the Greek coalition forces in the Peloponnese. Spread so that it will not be possible to rescue Thessaly in time!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax was stunned.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors, who was reminded, quickly reacted and immediately persuaded: "What Commander Patroclus said makes sense. Before, our tenacious defense was to defend Messenia and Laconia. Now we must protect For the smooth implementation of the landing plan, we can consider making some concessions, such as voluntarily giving up a defensive camp..."
