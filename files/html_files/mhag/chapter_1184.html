   Chapter 1184 Fierce Debate at the Athens Citizens' Assembly (1)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This... this..." Callisenos was frightened when he heard this. He was overwhelmed by the momentum of the young commander and did not dare to say a word to dissuade him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Then what will happen if this fertile land is vacated?" Clotokatax looked at Calicenos and said solemnly: "I think Mantinia is the most important place on the Peloponnese Peninsula. Theonia's most loyal ally, so I decided to give the land of Tegea to you Mandinia."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Calicenos's heart was beating wildly, thinking that he had heard wrong, and couldn't help but ask loudly again One sentence: "You...you mean to hand over the territory of Tegea to us?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It's no wonder that he was ecstatic. The territory of Tegea and Mandinia is the only plain in the Arcadia region. It is narrow from east to west, long from north to south, and the terrain is higher in the south and lower in the north. Tegea is located in the south and occupies most of the land of this small plain, while Mandinia is located in the north. The river floods every rainy season. The Mandinians Having suffered enough from the floods, they wanted to expand their land southward, so they had constant conflicts with the Tegea people.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just because Tegea received the full support of Sparta, the Mandinians had some scruples and did not trigger a major war.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Unexpectedly, before the Corinthian War, the Spartans invaded Mandinia. With the help of the Tegeans, they blocked the river in the north of the plain and used water attacks to destroy the city of Mandinia. Eternal suffering for the Dinians.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now that Mandinia has the opportunity to own the entire plain, not only can it obtain more fertile land to enhance its strength, but its long-standing worries will also be completely resolved. How can Calicenos not be overjoyed?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I hope Mantinia will give me an answer tomorrow! After tomorrow, I can only regard you Mantinia as abandoning this land and use it as Theonia's military base in the Peloponnese. ."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Don't worry, General Clotokatax, I will rush back to Mandinia right away, and we from Mandinia will definitely give you a definite answer tomorrow!" Calicenos said quickly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Okay, I'll wait for your reply." Clotokatax nodded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Calisenos got on his horse, held the reins tightly, tightened the horse's belly, urged the horse, and hurried toward the north.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Highness, if you hand over Tegea's territory to Mandinia, I'm afraid other city-states in the Arcadian Alliance will be dissatisfied with Mandinia." Printors reminded him at this time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax said with a firm expression: "Although the Arcadian Alliance has become our alliance, the situation within the alliance is too complicated, Tegea has rebelled, and Okomenus is also being lobbied... and How can we be reassured by cooperation with such an alliance!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is better to strengthen the relationship with Mandinia, which is truly willing to cooperate with us in a friendly manner. It was originally one of the strongest city-states in the Arcadia region. Now, If the Tegea territory is merged, the strength will skyrocket, and it will definitely become the absolute leader of the Arcadian Alliance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Moreover, once Mantinnia annexes the Tegea territory, not only the city-states of the Arcadia Alliance will be dissatisfied, Other city-states in mainland Greece may also want to interfere (this is the tradition in mainland Greece. A city-state is destroyed by enemies, and will be re-supported by enemies of enemies in a few years). Mantinia can only rely more on us. Onia!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "That Lycomedes from Mandinia looks very shrewd, I'm afraid he may not agree."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotocatacus smiled: "He is in Megalopolis now. After the Mantinians make their decision, I'm afraid he still doesn't know about it. And even if he knows, in the face of such huge interests, he alone can't convince all the people of Mantinnia."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crowe Tokatax considered it very carefully, and Printors had no doubts. At that moment, he felt like he was facing King Davos, and even his tone of voice became respectful unconsciously. Some: "I understand."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, Ctissus came over with a solemn expression holding an earthen jar, and said in a low tone: "This is the ashes of Adoris...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crotocathax He carefully took it and held it in his arms, tears flowed out again...
  </font>

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Kalias kept asking Looking around, I suddenly felt very nervous, because this was not the Executive Committee of the Generals of Athens, nor the 500-member parliament on Mars Hill, but the Citizens' Assembly on Pnyx Hill, the highest authority in Athens. Look at these layers. Listening to these noisy and heart-stopping murmurs of crowds of people, the Athenians claimed that "when they held citizens' assemblies, the number of people often exceeded 5,000," it seemed that it was by no means a lie. At
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   this moment , he saw the chief general of Athens, Callistratus, walking to the center of the venue, raising his right arm high, and his voice was loud and penetrating: "Citizens of Athens, the citizens' meeting has officially begun!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Gradually, the surrounding Athenian citizens stopped talking, and the entire meeting became quiet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus continued: "In the last meeting, we discussed the unprovoked invasion of the Peloponnese by the Theonian army. The envoy from Theonia also came to Athens today and wants to communicate with us on this issue. Let's first listen to what he said.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Callistratos pointed his finger at Callias, the tension in his heart disappeared at that moment. He stood up and walked to the center of the venue step by step...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the past years, Sparta , Corinth, Thebes, Megara, Argos... Almost all Greek city-states in the world once had envoys standing here, facing the picky citizens of Athens, explaining their city-state's proposition, or preparing for war. , or for alliance, or for trade, or just for citizens of a certain city-state who broke the law in Athens...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Countless famous Athenian scholars have also delivered exciting speeches here, including Solon, Demosthenes, Ari Stoddard, Themistocles, Cimon, Pericles, Alcibiades, Socrates...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Whether it was in the Theonian Academy or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Carias followed his teacher Ancita North has studied many articles about Athens speeches, and has traveled back and forth to various allies and tribes in the Western Mediterranean over the years. Although he received a relatively satisfactory answer in Thebes a few days ago - Thebes will remain neutral, But Karias understood that it was the Thebans who wanted to do this, and it was not his fault. Today finally came the time for him to really use force.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Karias stood in the center of the venue, his eyes scanning the surrounding area. With an indifferent face, a surge of pride arose in his heart.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He took a deep breath, feeling the abundant breath flowing between his chest, throat, mouth, and nasal cavity, and then spoke: "Citizens of Athens, I represent the 2 million citizens of the Kingdom of Theonia (excluding women and Children), I extend my sincere greetings to you!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   His first sentence caused a commotion among the surrounding Athenians: "Two million citizens?! Real or fake? Counting overseas territories, Athens will not exceed With 15,000 citizens, Theonia is more than ten times that of Athens?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I first want to correct a misnomer of Lord Callistratus. Theonia sent troops to the Peloponnese , in order to fulfill the covenant and help Thebes fight against the Spartan army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In this regard, I admire you Athenians. Just when the city of Thebes was occupied by the Spartans and the Theban democrats were in danger, It was you who bravely extended your hand to help them;
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   the Thebans retook the city, but faced the attack of the Spartan army, and it was you who were not afraid of the threat of the Spartans in such a dire situation. The Thebans formed an alliance and not only provided them with material assistance, but also sent a fleet to directly participate in the battle, threatening the Spartans' rear. The Thebans were able to persist until now and won the battle of Leuctra, and your Selfless help is absolutely inseparable.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Theonia formed an alliance with Thebes late, we in Theonia are very concerned about Sparta, the culprit who keeps provoking wars in the Greek mainland and makes the entire Greek people unable to live in peace. The culprit is deeply disgusted! We in Theonia also hate Sparta for continuing to bully Athens after the Peloponnesian War, and even invaded your territory, wantonly killed and plundered Piraeus during the Great King's Contract. The people in the villages near Sparta feel the disgusting incident without any regrets afterwards!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, even if Athens is tied up because of the new contract, you should be optimistic about Theonia's victory over Sparta... ..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus noticed that the faces of the citizens softened, and he immediately interrupted Callias intentionally: "Thank you very much for your wonderful speech, but first I want to correct a mistake of yours. , you can call me by my name, but you can't call me 'sir', because all Athenian citizens are equal, regardless of big or small. If I dare to call myself 'sir', I'm afraid my compatriots will use pottery pieces to drive me out of the country today. Yes."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There was a burst of laughter in the venue.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus continued: "However, it is no wonder that you would make such a mistake, because I heard that in the Kingdom of Theonia, the people in the country are divided into many levels, ranging from kings and ministers to The people at the bottom are very hierarchical and cannot be called by their names casually, otherwise they will be punished. It is no wonder that you appear more reserved when you come to Athens."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Karias smiled slightly: "I call you 'my lord', not just for you. Your kind of respect, and even more respect is the power given to you by the citizens of Athens, which is a concentrated expression of the will of all Athenian citizens. As for your talk about our Theonia, I would like to ask Calistratus first Lord Si, have you been to any of our towns in Theonia?"
