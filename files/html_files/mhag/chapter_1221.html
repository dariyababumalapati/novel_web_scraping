   was not because they sympathized with Jason's imminent defeat. Although the tyrant of Philae was not too cruel, in the process of conquering the entire Thessaly and becoming Tagus There was no shortage of bloody methods. Although later, with the assistance of Asidamas and others, the integration and governance methods of the city-states in Thessaly gradually became softer, but it has only been a few years, and everyone's memory has not yet Forget.

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   These Thessaly city-state councilors were worried that the upcoming war would cause the citizen soldiers of their own city-state in Jason's army to suffer heavy casualties, so they asked Patroclus one after another to persuade Jason to The citizen soldiers in the Song army came to surrender.

   Patroclus achieved his goal, but he did not let these people set off to Thermopylae immediately. Instead, he first convened an emergency military meeting. In addition to himself, Matonis, and Lizaru, the three military commanders who attended the meeting After some consultations, the four of them finally reached an agreement:

 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Matonis led the Second Army, the Fifth Army, the Ninth Army, and the First Cavalry Army with nearly 26,000 people. Temporarily stationed in Thessaly, continue to stabilize the order in this newly conquered area and prevent turbulence and recurrence. At the same time, we must also be wary of the Epirus people in the mountains to the west, because it is said that Alcaitas, a king of Epirus, and Jason was well connected and would likely be able to help him.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, Matonis was to assist Hieros in protecting the upcoming wheat harvest in Thessaly and to provide protection for the baggage trains that would subsequently transport military provisions.

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And Patroclus and Lizaru will lead the rest of the troops, a total of more than 40,000 soldiers, and immediately go south (Patroclus' words to the Thessalians have a lot of water content. At this time, they are in Thessaly. The Theonian army does not have 100,000 people, because it has to exclude the nearly 20,000 fleet infantry of the Theonian navy and the 12th Legion defending in Lamia). After solving the hidden danger of Jason, the march Greece.

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For these generals of the kingdom, it was undoubtedly a great honor to be able to lead the army into Central Greece, finally conquer Athens, and wash away the shame of being dismissed as barbarians by the Greeks led by Athens.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reason why Matonis agreed to stay was partly due to the persuasion of Hilos, and partly because as a Thessalian, he was willing to contribute to his hometown from the bottom of his heart.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After solving the problem of who should stay in Thessaly, Patroclus led the army across the southern mountains and entered the Lamia area with high spirits, and then the previous scene occurred.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   These Thessalian MPs were all celebrities in their respective city-states. The Thessalian soldiers quickly recognized them and immediately rushed to ask them about the situation in their respective mother states.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Jason arrived after hearing the news, the news that "the 100,000 Theonian army landed in Thessaly and had conquered various city-states, and the people of each city-state were eager for the safe return of citizen soldiers to their homes" quickly spread among the soldiers. , had a great impact on the morale of the army.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Citizen soldiers from various city-states gathered around the council members of their own city-states, eagerly discussing matters about returning home. The entire army had begun to show a trend of disintegration.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The furious Jason sent mercenaries to prepare to arrest them on the grounds that "these councilors surrendered to Theonia and are traitors to Thessaly". He wanted to isolate them from the citizen soldiers first, and then go To appease the army soldiers, the arrests of the mercenaries aroused resistance from the citizen soldiers and even triggered small-scale conflicts.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing that the riot was likely to gradually turn into a civil war, Jason had to urgently withdraw the mercenaries. Looking at the angry faces, he felt that he had lost control of these citizen soldiers. Unwilling to do so, he simply He walked alone among the citizen soldiers and loudly assured them that he had no harm to these Thessaly MPs and only wanted to learn the true situation in Thessaly from them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the end, several congressmen who had a good relationship with him told him in detail a series of things that happened in Thessaly during this period in front of many citizen soldiers, and also answered all his questions seriously.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   During the whole process, the surrounding citizen soldiers gradually looked at Jason with more sympathy in their wary eyes, but Jason's face became more and more ugly. Finally, he walked out of the crowd with a gloomy expression, got on his horse, and did not He took another look at the restless citizen soldiers and the congressmen who caused this terrible scene, but turned his horse's head and left here surrounded by mercenaries.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Jason remained silent on the way back to the rear camp. However, the moment he entered the camp, he suddenly fell off his horse, vomited blood, and fell into a coma. With the rescue of military doctors, his condition improved slightly. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   That night, the guards outside the tent heard Jason murmuring to himself: "Dorus, my good brother! ... Asidamas, I am sorry for you! ... Polyfulon, You devil!... Damn Theonia, you have ruined everything for me!... Dorus, my good brother..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Throughout the night, Jason's mournful muttering to himself never stopped.
  </font>

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The arrival of councilors from various city-states in Thessaly completely disintegrated Jason's army. In just one day, the citizen soldiers who were eager to go home In accordance with the requirements of the Theonia camp, they put down their weapons, formed a long queue, and passed the camp and Thermopylae in an orderly manner. Then they saw thousands of Theonia soldiers spread throughout the Lamia Plain depression. , not only did he completely believe the words of the congressmen, but any luck he might have had in his heart was also swept away.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The citizen soldiers of Thessaly left Jason and saw that the situation was not good. Naturally, those indigenous mountain warriors recruited by Jason could no longer fight for Jason, but most of the soldiers were unwilling to put down their weapons. Weapons, so they chose to cross the mountains and trek back to their hometown. Of course, this would involve great risks.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There were only nearly 8,000 mercenaries (after becoming Tagus, Jason once increased the number of mercenaries to tens of thousands. This time during his southern expedition to the Peloponnese, he left 3,000 mercenaries to be handed over to Pori. Commander Dorus, stationed in Thessaly), in return for Jason's care and trust in them over the years, remained loyal to him. When they saw that the army was falling apart and the situation was critical, they quickly gathered to protect the Jason, sober, retreated south.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The sentry sent by the Thermopylae military camp quickly reported the news to the commander-in-chief Patroclus who had arrived in Lamia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The news that Jason's army was defeated without a fight made Patroclus very excited. He issued an order: The Thirteenth Legion escorted these more than 20,000 unarmed citizen soldiers back to Thessaly safely.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The remaining legionnaires took the time to rest and march into Central Greece early tomorrow morning.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On this day in early September, Patroclus led 40,000 troops through Thermopylae. The soldiers lined up in neat columns, sang the "Song of the Legions" energetically, and walked south along the coastal road. After marching for 10 After several miles, the troops turned south and began to trek through low mountains and hilly areas. They successfully entered the plains of the Phokis area on the morning of the second day without any hindrance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The farmers of Phokis who were harvesting in the wheat fields hid in the town in panic, but the Theonian army neither attacked the towns of Phokis nor wreaked havoc on the farmland and villages outside the city. The entire army did not stop. Continuing to march south, the weak city-states of Phokis, in addition to thanking the gods for their blessing and escaping the disaster, dared to send troops to block the march of the Theonian army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   By the afternoon, the cavalry corps, as the vanguard, had entered the Boeotian area and approached Chaeronea, the westernmost city-state of Boeotian.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The people of Chaeronea felt very nervous when facing the dark Theonian cavalry under the city.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But the Diorian envoys who entered the city gave them reassurance: Thebes is an ally of Theonia, and Chaeronia is an ally of Thebes. As long as Chaeronia does not attack the Diorian army, The Theonian army will not cause any damage to the Chaeroneian region by taking any hostile action.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The people of Chaeronea were relieved and immediately said: Theonia is an ally of Thebes, and of course it is also an ally of Chaeronia, and Chaeronia will do its best to help its allies.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the cavalry regiment received a satisfactory answer, they did not stay much longer and continued to ride south, getting similar promises from the Boeotian city-states they passed one by one. The road from Chaeronea to Thebes was smooth. Although the cavalry regiment rested while walking, they still arrived at the gates of Thebes at noon on the second day.

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In this war between Theonia and the Greek Alliance, Thebes and its Boeotian Alliance basically maintained Neutral, but they have also been paying attention to the battle on the Peloponnese Peninsula. For Theban senior officials such as Ipamirondas and Pelopidas, what they are most worried about is the victory of the Greek Alliance, because that means that As the prestige of Athens and Thessaly has greatly increased, it will be a huge trouble for these two major forces in the northeast and the north to settle old scores with Thebes.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, although Thebes had to provide some help at the request of the Greek Alliance, such as providing the port of Cleuses, they still expected Theonia to win, but judging from the current situation, the Theonia army was in a The disadvantage makes them a little anxious.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, Ipamilonda often comforted his colleagues: he firmly believed that the advantage held by the Greek coalition temporarily put together by various city-states could not last long, and the powerful Kingdom of Theonia would definitely fight back.
