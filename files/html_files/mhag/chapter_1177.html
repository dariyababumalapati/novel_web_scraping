   Chapter 1177 Battle of Tegea (3)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Accompanied by the roar of the soldiers of the Theonian Legion, nearly 20,000 javelins flew out, covering the sky and the sun.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The charge of the Spartan coalition soldiers stopped instantly, followed by continuous screams.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The shocked Spartan coalition soldiers had just removed their bucklers, and were shocked to find that countless javelins were attacking.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although before the battle, Agesilaus specifically reminded the mercenary generals to be careful that the heavy infantry of the Theonian Legion would throw javelins when approaching, mercenaries who had never had experience fighting against the Theonians We are still not prepared enough.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Taking advantage of the Spartan army's frontline formation being disrupted by javelin rain, the legionnaires shouted the name of Hades and launched a charge. The four-mile-long Theonian army formation crashed into the army like a mountain. The Spartan coalition.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldiers of the Sixth Army were holding their breath because they heard from the team officers that the commander asked the Fourth Army to fight the Spartans on the right wing, the First Army on the left as the focus of the attack, and their Sixth Army on The middle lane is just a containment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Why can our Sixth Army only act as a diversion?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ...The soldiers vowed to let the young prince see the power of the Sixth Legion, so they roared angrily, focused all their strength on the long shield in their left hand, and slammed into the enemy who was trying to restore their formation. The stab in their right hand The gun passed through the gap like lightning, and accurately pierced the enemy hiding behind the buckler...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldiers of the Sixth Legion launched an unreserved attack with all their strength from the beginning, leaving the Spartan army in the middle of the formation that was in disarray due to the javelin attack. There was even more chaos at the front.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldiers of the Fourth Legion were reserved in their charge. This was because their opponents were famous Spartan warriors and they had to be prepared.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But when they rushed forward and started fighting, the Spartans' counterattack was not sharp, and they also seemed passive under the soldiers' rapid attacks. Although the soldiers breathed a sigh of relief, they were slightly disappointed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the left wing, the soldiers of the First Army shouldered the important task of winning the battle. They also attacked with all their strength. However, the mercenaries who had just been attacked by the javelin rain slowed down the rear in a tacit understanding, which greatly eased the First Army's attack. The soldiers' charge, and at the same time their fierce counterattacks from time to time amid the solid defense, caused some casualties to the frontline soldiers of the First Army, forcing the soldiers to stop their aggressive advance and begin to patiently fight with the enemy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In general, the Theonian army relied on the long-range attacks of light infantry and the javelin strikes of heavy infantry to gain the upper hand from the beginning, making the Spartan army appear somewhat passive in the frontal confrontation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, Agesilaus had thickened the columns of the left and center military formations as expected before the war. He relied on stronger pushing force to withstand the impact of the legionnaires, and gradually stabilized the battle situation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the battle between the two sides returned to a balance of power, the scouts rushed back to the command center and reported to Clotokatax: The cavalry on both sides had defeated the Spartan cavalry and were pursuing them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A smile finally appeared on Crotokatax's nervous face. Although he knew that even if the cavalry won, the small number of cavalry would not make much difference in a battle of tens of thousands, but after all, it was a good sign.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He was about to say something to Printols to relieve the tension in his heart, when suddenly he heard the faint sound of a bugle, and was stunned for a moment, thinking that he had heard it wrong.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But the sound of the trumpet continued, becoming clearer and clearer.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He subconsciously looked around the battlefield filled with morning mist and loud noise, unable to distinguish the source of the trumpet for a while.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Printols had already given a serious order to Muklu: "This is not our bugle! You immediately send out several staff officers to investigate around and find out the source of the bugle as soon as possible!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes!" Muklu also realized the seriousness of the problem and immediately rushed to perform the task.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lord Printors, could it be Spartan reinforcements coming?!" Clotokatax asked very worriedly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors turned around, pointed to the back, and calmly comforted: "Your Highness, don't worry, even if Sparta's reinforcements come, we can defeat him!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The same thing happened behind and on both sides of the command center. There is a larger square formation, which contains not only the 3,000 heavy infantry of the Seventh Army, but also the three light armored infantry brigades and the mountain reconnaissance group of other legions, with a total of 7,000 people. Printors will 1/4 of the entire army. The decision to use the troops as a reserve was indeed too bold, but now it gave Clotokatax confidence.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not long after the several staff officers set off, a scout cavalry returned: "Sir Commander, about four to five thousand soldiers rushed out of the city of Tegea, blowing the bugle and marching towards the battlefield!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It's the Tegea people !
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The bugle is blowing!" Clotokatax suddenly realized.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "We saved Tegea, but the Tegea people didn't send anyone to contact us and express their gratitude to us. The battle started for a while before they sent troops out..." Muklu complained softly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The Tegeans were attacked by the Spartan army before, and they should have suffered a lot of losses. Moreover, such a large-scale battle took place on their doorstep. It is understandable to remain vigilant..." Clotokatax also added For the sake of the Taigea people, he explained a few words, and then said excitedly: "Now they are not only participating in the battle, but also sending so many soldiers, which will definitely help us win as soon as possible!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Put the battle map at this moment Bring it!" said Printors.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A staff officer immediately handed over a wooden board that he carried with him. On it was a simplified battlefield situation map drawn based on various battlefield information previously detected by Zhenqi.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors took it and took a look, and immediately his face darkened: "Our cavalry has defeated the Spartan cavalry, and you didn't correct it in time!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not yet... not enough time."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Battlefield information changes rapidly, once If you are slow, you will be slow again and again, how can you provide good assistance to the commander!" Printors severely criticized.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Sir, I was wrong, I will correct it immediately!" The staff officer lowered his head and wanted to take back the board in shame.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors did not give it to him right away, but took the wooden board and asked the scout in a deep voice: "Where is Tegea's army?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Today's Theonia scouts are specially trained. Not only is he good at riding, has a strong sense of direction, has sharp eyesight, and is good at observing and estimating the number of troops, but he is also good at reading maps and drawing... So he just glanced at the wooden board and pressed his finger on it without hesitation: "They are here. !"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors took a closer look: the Tegea army was behind the left wing of the Theonian army formation, not far to the south of Tegea city.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Highness, we should immediately send someone to notify the Tegeans and ask them to go around to the rear of the Spartan army and attack the right wing of Sparta." Printors suggested to Clotokatax. , while gesturing on the wooden board.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crotokatax understood immediately. He looked around and said: "To show respect for the Tegea people, Muklu, please go for a run." "As
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ordered."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Wait. Wait! Let the guide named Callisenos from Mandinia go with you, so that it will be easier to communicate with the Tegeans."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It should be said that Crotokatax was very thoughtful, and Muklu was pleased Follow the order and leave.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors looked to the north thoughtfully. Because the dust and fog blocked his sight, he could not see the Tegea army two miles away at all.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He felt vaguely uneasy, but he couldn't remember where the uneasiness came from.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus also heard the bugle that kept ringing. He stood up again and looked to the north. Waves finally appeared on his calm face: "The Tegeans finally came out. It's time for our soldiers to take action."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Until now, Max, who was at the forefront of the military formation, was increasingly surprised. His soldiers had tried their best, but the enemy on the opposite side not only did not fall behind, but also passed through Corinth Through the narrow eye holes of the helmet, he could feel the indifference and bloodthirstiness revealed in those sharp eyes, as if they still had some energy left.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Where did the Spartans recruit these soldiers?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   so smart!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ... Max realized that the First Army was going to have a hard time fighting.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, he heard a roar from the opposite side, and the roar became louder and louder. He subconsciously tightened his shield and shouted to his soldiers: "Pay attention to defense! Pay attention to defense!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But what happened next The situation was completely beyond his expectation. The enemies on the opposite side turned and ran away amidst the roars.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the soldiers at the front of the First Legion were a little dazed, they immediately cheered and pursued.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ……………………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as Muklu left on horseback, the Theonian army's rear command center received good news: the right wing of the Spartan army was defeated, and the fourth A regiment is in pursuit.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Great! The First Legion is indeed the strongest legion in the kingdom. It seems that we have won this battle!" Clotoka Taxx was so excited that he danced with excitement, and the previous nervousness and worries had long since disappeared. Without a trace, he even suggested: "Lord Printors, do you want to send out all the reserves? Otherwise, they will not get any merit at all and the battle will be over."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But Printors was not only not overjoyed, but Somewhat confused: "Strange! According to the information reported by the previous reconnaissance cavalry, Sparta's right-wing defense was tenacious, and the First Army did not take advantage. How could they suddenly be defeated without any warning?" "You doubt it
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ? Are they pretending to be defeated?!" Crotokatax was startled, and then shook his head: "This is impossible! In such a big battle, thousands of people are pretending to be defeated at the same time. Even our legionnaires will find it difficult. If you control it well, you can easily cause the entire formation to collapse if you are not careful, let alone those improvised mercenaries."
