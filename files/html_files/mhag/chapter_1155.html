   Chapter 1155 Henepolis's Recommendation
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Where is he now?" Davos asked with interest.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The year before last, he had retired and returned to Amendolara. However, he is a restless person and applied to the Ministry of Military Affairs to serve as the military training officer of Amendolara..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Zantiparis can still lead the army in his 60s. Kill the enemy and make meritorious service to the kingdom. Ctissus is younger than him. I think his performance should be equally outstanding, but..." Davos asked with some uncertainty: "He has refused to serve as the legion commander many times. Could it be that Will you agree this time?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, this time is different from the past. The First Army does not have a commander when it may face a battle at any time. This is actually a big crisis for the First Army, and As a veteran of the First Legion, Ctissus will never stand idly by, not to mention this is a temporary takeover, I believe he will not refuse!" Alexis said firmly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Okay, it's him!" Davos agreed simply, and then asked: "Who can replace Proseus?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alexis said hesitantly: "What does your majesty think of Matonis? "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He is a fierce general and can charge into battle, but he lacks experience in commanding multiple regiments, and the political environment in Greece is complicated..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos said it euphemistically, but Alexis understood it, and he continued Said: "How about Olivers?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Olivers is really flexible in mind, but he also lacks the experience of commanding multiple regiments, and he is sometimes not decisive enough at critical moments, and now the army is facing the Spartans..." Dai Firth's words were equally tactful.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What about Lizaru?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You forgot that I specifically said last time not to send non-Greek citizens to fight, let alone the commander of an army."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, I was negligent! Then... Xiros How?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "How could Hilos suddenly abandon his important task as the administrator of the Turii region and go to the Peloponnese to lead the army in combat? What's more, he has been away from the front line for many years, and he may be a little unfamiliar with commanding operations... Not only him, but also Capps." Davos was a little dissatisfied with the candidates he proposed, and couldn't help but said: "What do you think of Patroclus?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alexis was already prepared, He immediately responded: "Patroclus is indeed a more suitable candidate, but he is now stationed in the Po River region and has to fight against the Agurians at any time. He also has to ensure the stability of the Po River region. It is really not appropriate to send him away at this time. Transfer... Sextus did the same in the Iberia region, and although Chalcedis is also very capable, he also lacks the experience of commanding multiple legions..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos looked at him, and his tone of voice increased. He asked: "There are so many generals in the kingdom, why can't we find a suitable candidate?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, any of the generals mentioned above can be the commander of an army, just because he went to Greece for the first time , in order to better demonstrate the strength of the kingdom to our motherland, we have higher requirements." Alexis persuaded in the same gentle tone, he paused, and then said with a smile on his face: "Your Majesty, I I have thought of a suitable candidate who should be able to meet your requirements!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Oh, tell me."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Printors." Alexis said firmly: "Although he is now the chief of staff, he once was He served as the commander of the Fourteenth Army Corps, and also commanded many legions during the Western Mediterranean War with outstanding performance. Your Majesty should know his military exploits better than I do." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But he is now the chief of staff and has heavy military duties - —"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Tormid or Philisius can take over temporarily."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Well..." Davos stroked his chin and said thoughtfully: "I will discuss it with Printors in person and listen to him. Let's make a decision after expressing our wishes."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After watching Alexis walk out of the conference hall, Davos said softly with some emotion: "Many old people in the Ministry of Military Affairs are not willing to give young people more opportunities. Even Alexis is no exception."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Henepolis said: "Your Majesty, I think Lord Alexis and Lord Printors have a very close relationship."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing this Davos was silent for a moment and then said slowly: "They have been comrades-in-arms for many years."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty." Henipolis looked at Davos and bravely said softly: "I also have a suitable one. I would like to recommend a candidate to you."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Oh? Do you also have a candidate?" Davos became interested and smiled: "Tell me about it."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I think Prince Clotokatax is suitable to be the commander-in-chief of the expeditionary army. ."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The candidate named by Henipolis was beyond Davos's expectation. He looked at Henipolis, but thought in his heart: His son had not returned to Tulii for a long time, and he had nothing to do with Henipolis. Contact, is this just Henepolis's own idea?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos asked tentatively: "Klotto rarely goes into battle to kill the enemy, and he has no experience in commanding an army. How can he be the commander in chief?! This is a life-and-death war, not a game!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   His Royal Highness Cloteau does not With experience, Printors can assist him. Your Majesty, didn't you say before that you transferred His Highness Croteau from Rome to let him take on greater responsibilities! His Highness Croteau is your heir in the future. The King of Theonia, although he cannot be victorious on the battlefield like you, he must at least have a certain influence on the army, otherwise in the future he will face the likes of Alexis and Amyntas who make decisions worth tens of millions. A military general who is responsible for life and death, can he calmly refute their suggestions and put forward his own opinions?" Henipolis said sincerely.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos stared at him for a long time, and sighed in a gentle tone: "You are the only one in the entire kingdom who can think about me like this!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dusk, Davos Return to the mansion on the hill.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Dinner is the most lively time of the Davos royal family. The large round dining table is full of people: King Davos and his two princesses, Clotokatax and his two children, Apox and his wife. One child, Eunice and his wife (who last year married Alex, a famous sculptor from Tarentum), Briantes, Ivia, and Cynthia with her two children, Adoris's wife loves Dui and a child.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the children grew up a few years ago and started to have their own families and careers, the Davos couple became older and longed for a lively and prosperous family. However, the mansion was often deserted, so Davos hired the best in the kingdom. Engineers designed according to the terrain of the entire hill, and then Christoya spent a huge amount of money to hire a large construction team to build multiple mansions on the hill according to the drawings.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The hills of King's Hill are gentle, and the top and mountainside are suitable for building a large number of houses. However, because of Davos's noble status, there is only one mansion in the entire hill.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because the funds were sufficient, only half a year later, there were several more mansions on the hill.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then Davos forcibly issued an order to Apox and Antbris, requiring them to move to the new mansion. Later, Eunice also followed the instructions after her marriage. Although Antbris had some resistance, she was not allowed to live in the new mansion in the end. Never give up.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos also requested that the whole family dine together as much as possible in the evening.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sometimes Krystoya would invite Cynthia and Adoris's family to come for dinner. Since the Clotokatax family had just returned, Cynthia and Adoris's wife often came over to have gatherings these days.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "...The game is almost over. Our team is still one point behind, but we still have one last attack, and we are only three meters away from the end line. Three meters is not that far, isn't it?" Antbres asked the children surrounding him. them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes!!" Several older children rushed to answer, and the younger children also shouted together.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "But -" Anteblis stroked with both hands and said with a serious expression: "The opponent's players lined up in a dense wall and blocked us in front. There was no gap to pass through. What should we do?! The referee blew the whistle After the whistle, the game started. Our team's quarterback made a pass to the left winger. After diverting the opponent's attention, he quickly handed the football to the player next to him. The player who caught the ball It's me!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The children made surprised sounds.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "There was not much time left. I held the ball, lowered my head, and pushed it forward with the help of my teammates. The other players tried their best to block me, and several people even pressed on me. I used all my strength. Carrying them, I just arched forward... My eyes were full of feet, and I couldn't see where the end line was. It felt like the time was very long... Suddenly I heard a whistle, we scored a touchdown! The game is over, we The Thuliyi rugby team won the Kingdom Rugby Finals, and I, your uncle, also became the best player in the final!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Wow! My uncle is so awesome!!..." In the eyes of the children with admiration, In the middle, Anteblis looked proud.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Didn't you have such an outstanding performance in the finals last year? Look at you, you are bragging every day!" Eunice couldn't help but said: "I have always felt that the reason why you were able to succeed in the end was because Your identity prevents Oudi's players from hurting you..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You are blaspheming the sacred rugby finals!" Antbris suddenly turned red with anger and stood up suddenly: "You Niss, you keep talking nonsense..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Okay!" Christoya slammed the table hard and shouted: "You two, please be quiet! You are so old and you still quarrel when we meet. , and don't set a good example for the children!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "She said it first—"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You still said it!" Christoya yelled again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Antbris had no choice but to shut his mouth in embarrassment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
