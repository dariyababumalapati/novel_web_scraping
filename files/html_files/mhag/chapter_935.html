   Chapter 935 The New Order in Central Italy
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos smiled slightly and said loudly: "If you understand the history of the founding of Theonia, you will find that Theonia has never actively invaded the territories of other city-states and races. Usually other forces invade Theonia first. Diaonia, and even some city-states broke their promises, suddenly tore up their alliances with us, brazenly invaded the territory of Theonia, and killed the people of Theonia, which led to the anger of our Theonia, angrily counterattack, Destroy it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It can be seen from this that our Theonia is not the former Rome. We are not tyrannical, nor are we greedy for other countries' lands. On the contrary, we love peace and are willing to live in friendship with our neighbors. Here, in the Latium region, Theonia will continue to uphold our consistent diplomatic attitude. For any force that wants to have friendly exchanges with Theonia, we will live in peace with it and even sign some friendly agreements to conduct Wider trade exchanges, cultural exchanges, and even mutual aid...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I want to make a solemn promise to you here. Theonia came to Latium not to bring more wars to this war-prone land, but to eliminate wars and bring peace and harmony. Prosperity, this not only applies to the Romans and Latins under the rule of Theonia, but also to you, as neighbors of Rome, who are also willing to live in friendship with us! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although some forces had received similar assurances in previous contacts with envoys sent by Theonia, when these words were spoken by the king of Theonia himself, it undoubtedly made the envoys more reassured.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then, the Sabine envoy asked: "Can we Sabines also become an alliance with Theonia?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Of course!" Davos said with a smile: "As long as you, Sabine, are willing to be friends with Theonia, of course Theonia is also willing to form an alliance with you! When the banquet is over, you can find our diplomacy Guan Tapyrus, discuss the alliance."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As Davos spoke, he pointed at Tapirus, who was sitting at the banquet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tapirus immediately stood up and greeted the Sabine envoy with a smile.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Sabine envoy responded quickly, and he breathed a long sigh of relief: Theonia occupied Rome and Phedina, Crustaium surrendered to it, and Theonia's sphere of influence bordered on the Sabine territory. Among all the surrounding forces, Sabine has become the closest force to the Roman city, the central town of the Kingdom of Theonia in Latium. The Romans have been suppressing Sabine for more than 10 years, and now they are here They found a Theonia that was more powerful than Rome, which frightened them even more. Now that they have the promise of King Theonia and can form an alliance, they can be said to be completely relieved.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not only the Sabines, but other forces also have this fear to a greater or lesser extent, so the envoys have also expressed their willingness to form an alliance with Theonia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos all agreed one by one.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Dear Your Majesty the King of Theonia, I have a question." Envoy Masi asked loudly: "If there is a war between two allies of Theonia... For example, we, Maxi, have formed an alliance with Theonia In the future, conflicts with the Herniki people led to wars, and they all asked Theonia for help. Will Theonia help the Herniki people who have a closer relationship with you? Or will it help the newly formed alliance with Masi? ?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "We Herniki people are busy rebuilding our homeland, how can we conflict with the Masi people who have helped us!" Although Nemeri was complaining, like other envoys, he was looking forward to Davos's answer.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Central Italy has many forces and complex relationships. Conflicts and wars occur from time to time. In recent years, it is only because of the strength and rapid expansion of Rome that the surrounding forces have been forced to temporarily unite under pressure." Davos smiled slightly. , his voice was not loud, but he said resolutely: "I have just said that Theonia is here for peace and prosperity. We will first stop the ongoing war and gather both parties to discuss the causes of the conflict. Discuss and find a way to resolve the conflict so that both parties can eventually restore peace.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I believe that people of all races yearn for a peaceful life and do not want to be involved in wars with no guarantee of life. If there is such a race that relies on war and plunder for a living, then it will be a common danger for us and must be We will fight against him together! Are you right? "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, you are right! If Wolsi has a conflict with other races one day, we are willing to listen to the Theonian envoy to help us resolve the dispute!" Catamontaros first expressed his position.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "We Herniki people are also willing to obey any decision of the Theonian envoy!" Nemeli also rushed to say.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Messengers from other races, including the Masi people, have understood: King Daves wants to establish a new order centered on Theonia in central Italy, and wants other races and forces to follow it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For them, this is actually not a bad thing, because as far as they know, the Theonian army did not pay too many casualties and destroyed Rome, which they feared. Since the Theonian king promised They would feel much more at ease if they did not use such terrifying force and settled the dispute through negotiation, so they all agreed with Davos' decision one after another.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, someone said loudly: "Dear Majesty King Davos, the Celts in the north are what you call a terrible force that lives by plundering. They invaded the Latium area 20 years ago, and now they are again Beginning to become active in the north, it is said that the former Celtic king Brennus never forgot his defeat in Rome before he died, and repeatedly warned the leaders around him to avenge him. Perhaps a few years later, the Celts It will come back again, and we all need to be prepared for it, what do you think about it?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as these words came out, the messengers present fell silent. Although the Celtic invasion occurred 20 years ago, because the war lasted for a year, all the forces in Latium were affected to some extent, so they were all deeply impressed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos followed the call and found out that the person speaking was the messenger from the city of Fufluna. Fuluna is one of the twelve Etruscan city-states. This time, it represents the northern Etruscan city-states that have not allied with Theonia and came to Rome. Because these northern Etruscans Between the city-state and the Latium territory controlled by Theonia, there are Tarchuna, Volch and other southern Etruscan city-states that have just formed an alliance with Theonia. The two sides have not communicated before, and there is no What kind of conflict of interest, Davos had been speculating on their intentions, and now he finally realized it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I have just said that no force is allowed to destroy the peace and tranquility of this land!" Davos said without hesitation: "As long as the Volts dare to invade the territories of Volch and Tarchuna, Dio Nia will definitely gather a large army, cross the Tiber River, help the allies, and repel the Celts!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The envoy of Fufluna was stunned and blurted out: "What about northern Etruria? The Celts attacked northern Etruria. If Theonia ignores it, the situation will be very bad! Etruria The sub-region has a flat terrain. In recent years, the northern Etruscan city-states have only relied on the continuous mountainous areas on its northern border to barely contain the Celtic invasion. However, if the Celts gathered an army to invade south, the northern Etruscan city-states would It is difficult for various city-states to resist. Once the Celts gain a foothold in the north, it will be easier and more violent to attack the south! By then, the brutal Celts will attack Rome again , attack Latium and avenge their old king Brennus!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos looked embarrassed and said hesitantly: "What you said makes sense, but Theonia does not have any diplomatic contact with your northern Etruscan city-state. Even if Theonia wants to rescue, I don't dare to lead troops into your territory rashly, lest the Etruscan people will think that the Theonians are invaders like the Celts."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The envoy of Fulfluna heard the meaning of Daves' words, immediately stood up, saluted respectfully to Daves, and said: "As long as Theonia is willing to help us Etruria resist the Celts, we The northern Etruscan city-states are willing to form an alliance with Theonia!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos nodded gently and said loudly: "It is a good thing that the northern city-states of Etruria are willing to form an alliance with Theonia. I welcome it very much! After the banquet is over, you can also join other alliances. Like an envoy, discuss alliance matters with our diplomat Tapyrus. I said that Theonia came here to make friends, and we are very willing to cooperate with the Latium region, the Etruscan region, Join hands with new friends from other regions to defend against external enemies! Let's defend the peace of our homeland together!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty, what you said is so good!" Catemantaros of Wolsey raised his wine glass, stood up again, and said loudly and excitedly: "I propose that we jointly respect the distinguished King of Theonia and thank him Brought us peace!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Cartamontaros's proposal was immediately responded to by other envoys.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos smiled and toasted with them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Tapirus finished the glass of wine and was quite excited. Although he would be very busy next, this busyness reflected the value of a diplomat. After coming to the Latium area for half a year, he could finally Show off your skills.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Messenger Fuluna sat down, he breathed a sigh of relief.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What he just said is not entirely true. Since the Celts invaded the south 20 years ago, the strength of the Etruscan city-states has been greatly weakened, and the city-states in the north are even more serious, because the Celts have been Although people no longer gathered large armies to go south, small-scale invasions were frequent. The northern city-states helped each other and jointly defended each other at the beginning, but due to repeated failures, they could only fight on their own and struggled to support themselves. So when Rome attacked the southern Etruscan city-states, the northern city-states could only watch helplessly as they were forced to surrender to Rome because they themselves were too busy to take care of themselves and had no spare energy to reinforce the south.
