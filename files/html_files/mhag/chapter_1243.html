   Chapter 1243 The King's Son-in-Law
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "How will you know if you don't try." Sosikles broke free from his hand, and after walking a few steps, he whispered in a low voice: "Brother Stas is too honest."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pekes Tas was the second son of Hieros, who married the eldest sister of Sostatus, so they were cousins.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Pekestus is older, he is influenced by his family education and follows the rules.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Sosikles was younger, Sostatus intended to train him to be the heir to his business, so he was more tactful and flexible in his work.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sosikles went back and told his slaves to take care of the children, and then he walked slowly southward along the zoo wall.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Turiyi Zoo, whose full name is Turiyi Kingdom Zoo, is built on a hill near the Krati River, and the entire hill is owned by the zoo.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It has been established for 7 years, but construction has never stopped. Because the east side of this hill is gentle, the west and north sides are steeper, and the south side is close to the river, so there is only a wall built at the foot of the east side.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Originally it only opened one door, but due to the increasing number of tourists, it was neither safe nor convenient for Aviya who often went in and out of the zoo, so a side door was built at the foot of the south mountain for Aviya and the palace. Guards and staff came and went.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   From a distance, Sosikles saw some scattered people standing at the side door. Apparently, they had the same purpose as him, but they failed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He walked over with his head held high, and said to the guard standing at the door in a neither humble nor condescending manner: "I am the younger brother of Axicus. I have something important to see him!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The guard quickly called the team officer and whispered to him. sentence, the team officer looked at Sosikles, and then said: "Wait a moment."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ………………………………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Near this side door There is a huge water wheel erected on the riverside, and a long stone flume, which is embedded in the wall, leading the water of the Kraty River into the zoo, and finally into an artificial lake not far from the main entrance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There are large iron cages and huts next to the iron cages placed around the artificial lake. In front of each iron cage, some people gather, exclaiming and screaming from time to time.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There were also spectators gathered in some places, but there were no iron cages. Instead, large pits were dug with low walls and pools in them... Suddenly
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   , the people in front of a large pit let out deafening cheers. , the animal that was hiding in the pool at the bottom of the pit finally climbed ashore. It has a huge mouth, but a pair of small ears, and a thick body like a cow with 4 thick short legs... This is The hippopotamus from the Nile River shook its little ears and sprayed water from its mouth, causing waves of cheers from tourists...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In a corner next to this big pit, there was a person who looked different because he sat quietly and looked in front of him. There is also a wooden board erected. On the wooden board is an unfinished painting, which is the hippopotamus at the bottom of the pit.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But the continuous screams obviously disturbed him. He threw the ink pen in his hand to the ground angrily, and then looked at the excited tourists, and finally showed helplessness on his face.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, a simple-looking young man hurriedly walked up to him and said diligently: "Brother, it's so hot. Let's drink some syrup first to quench our thirst!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as he finished speaking, the servant next to him immediately took off his backpack. From the wooden box, he took out a long-eared pottery bottle and two clean wooden cups, pulled out the corks, poured green syrup, then opened another wooden box wrapped in layers of cloth, and picked up a few pieces with wooden clamps. Place ice cubes carefully into the cup.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The people next to them saw this operation and couldn't help but look at them carefully. After all, it is definitely not ordinary people who can use ice cubes to cool down on hot days.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The man who was painting unceremoniously picked up a glass and drank it in one go. Then he chewed ice cubes and said vaguely: "Yes, it's apple juice. Pour me another glass."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The slave quickly took the water and poured it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I say Axikus, do you usually drink water so extravagantly?" This man drank the syrupy water provided by others, but he actually criticized him. It was a bit too much.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But the young man didn't care. He also took a sip of syrup and explained: "I am busy with this and that every day. How can I be so delicate? This is all prepared for Ivia." The
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   painting man stopped talking.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The young man asked curiously: "Brother, haven't you been helping the city hall with carvings and designs for the sports games recently? Why do you have time to come here?" "I've already
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   finished helping them, so I came out to relax today."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Then. If you want to come to the zoo, you should tell us in advance. If Sister Eunice knows that we have not taken good care of you, Aviya and I will have to be scolded by her!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It turns out that these two people are King Davos's Two sons-in-law: Arex and Axicus.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hearing this, Alex felt a little uncomfortable.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He used to sculpt and paint, and could go without eating or sleeping for long periods of time, completely immersed in creation, which was actually very harmful to his body.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After getting married, Eunice asked him to change his bad living habits. The two had several quarrels about this. Later, Davos intervened and had a conversation with the couple before he was willing to make the decision. After the change, Eunice also took careful care of his life, allowing him to devote himself wholeheartedly to creation. From then on, his sculpture and painting skills continued to make new progress, and he eventually became the top sculptor in the entire kingdom.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I have hands and feet, what do I need you to take care of!" Alex scolded nonchalantly, and then whispered: "If you really want to help me, drive all these tourists out!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Aksiku Si shook his head hurriedly: "I can't do this! Before, Aviya wanted to only allow a few hundred people to enter the park. I tried to persuade her for a long time. Now there are all tourists outside the park. If it causes a commotion, it will be troublesome!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " I said you hang around Aviya every day now, and you don't even care about your father's business?" Alex couldn't help but ask.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Axikus scratched his head and did not answer directly. Instead, he asked: "I heard that Theonia Academy is going to set up another art academy and prepare you to be the dean. Is this true?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " Alex hesitated for a moment, looked at the painting on the wooden board, and said softly: "This matter is still under discussion and has not been finalized yet."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Alex has his own carving room and several apprentices, But this is completely different from becoming a dean and having to teach and manage dozens or even hundreds of students. It is precisely because of the pressure that he sneaks out to draw alone these days to relax.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the news was confirmed, Axikus was overjoyed: as the largest iron manufacturer in the Kingdom of Theonia, his father not only continued to lead the way in weapons and equipment and civilian iron tools, but also began to get involved in metal crafts. Production, for example, the previous Anteblis star statue was designed by Alex and produced by Theos Iron Workshop.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But after all, his family does not have enough background in handicraft manufacturing and does not have enough carvers. In the metal handicraft market of the kingdom, some well-known carvers either work alone or are trained by other manufacturing workshops. Dai Dai, who is about to establish Oniya Art Institute will be great news for his family's handicraft workshop.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just as Axikus was thinking about it, the zoo guard came and said: His brother is looking for him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He was suddenly stunned: Because he has no brothers, only one sister, who is so bold and dares to pretend to be his brother?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Axikus decided to go and see what happened.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When he walked to the side door, he saw a young man waving to him and shouting: "Brother, it's me!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Axikus suddenly smiled.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since Theos and Sostatus were both big businessmen in Thurii, and they were both members of the Thurii Chamber of Commerce, the two families often had contact with each other. Furthermore, Sostatus intended to train his second son and often brought him to visit him. , Axikus really likes this smart little brother.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Why are you here?" Axikus asked pleasantly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Brother, help me!" Sosikles said with a pitiful look: "We don't want to have a sports meeting now. There are many guests coming to my house, and my father insisted that I take the children of these guests to the zoo. As a result, When we arrived, we found that we had to wait for a long time, and the weather was so hot that the younger children could hardly stand it..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "How many people are there?" Axikus frowned.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Including me, there are five people. However, I just saw that my cousin Pekestus was also queuing up. He brought about seven people with him. Can you join us..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pekestus?" Ake Sikus was stunned for a moment, and immediately understood that the only person who could be called cousin by this little guy was the son of Xinos, the administrator of Thessaly region. He thought for a while and said: "Okay. But you have to first Wait outside for a while, I have to go and tell Aviya first, it should be fine."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Thank you, brother!" Sosiklis said gratefully, watching Axikus walk into the side door and ride on a horse The Brutti horse brought by the slave disappeared in the blink of an eye, and he couldn't help but think about it: There are rumors that the reason why Axikus was attracted by Princess Aviya was because he was like a dog, surrounded every day. Turning into a princess, even after getting married, is still like this, with no spirit and pursuit of her own. It is simply embarrassing the young citizens of the upper class of the kingdom...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sosikles used to sneer at this statement, thinking that it was just some people. The harsh words spoken out of jealousy now seem to be true.
  </font>
 </font>

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Brutima walked on the flat stone road, carefully avoiding the bustling tourists, and came to a high mountain halfway up the mountain. in front of the yard enclosed by iron railings.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Axikus dismounted and hurried to the wooden house at the back of the yard. Several antelopes in the yard immediately stopped grazing and looked at the sudden intruder warily.
