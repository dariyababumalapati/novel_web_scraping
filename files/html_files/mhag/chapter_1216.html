   Chapter 1216 Returning to his hometown
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   and standing in front of the familiar yet unfamiliar city of Larissa, Hilos could not help but sigh: More than 30 years ago, he lost his land and lived in poverty, so he had to accept the Spartans who came to recruit soldiers in order to survive. He was hired to go out to fight.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When he left here, his mood was gloomy, because the stories he heard about the Thessalian mercenaries made him have a premonition that he would probably die on the battlefield like most of them, and would never be able to return to his hometown... He really never thought that he would return to his hometown as a conqueror.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hieros rode his war horse and stood there in a daze. Most of the officials behind him already knew that Larissa was the hometown of this important minister of the kingdom, so no one stepped forward to disturb him.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But Hilos quickly broke away from this dejected mood, took a deep breath, turned around and said to the officials: "Let's go into the city." When the
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   officer responsible for guarding the city gate saw the arrival of Hilos and his party, he immediately He came forward and saluted and said: "Lord Hilos, I salute you! Commander Matonis and Commander Lizaru are waiting for your arrival at the city lord's mansion!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After saying that, he turned around and led the way.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hilos rode his war horse and slowly walked into the city. He looked around: the streets were clean and tidy, obviously after careful cleaning, but occasionally you could still see blood stains on the ground; there were no pedestrians on the road, only people who were fully armed and Legion soldiers standing upright on the roadside; but through the gaps in the doors and windows of the houses on both sides of the street, one can see pairs of angry and fearful eyes... The
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   city lord's residence is near the square in the center of the city. This building was opened when Hilos left. It existed. It was the residence of a tyrant at that time. Due to the passage of time, he could no longer remember the name of the tyrant.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Captain, I've finally waited for you!" Seeing Hilos walking into the yard, Matonis took the initiative to greet him with a smile on his face, and his voice was as loud as a bell: "Yesterday, Lizaru and I led the brothers and we hardly talked. I ran for more than 100 miles with a rest, and then launched an attack on Larissa. By the time the city was captured, the brothers almost all fell down from exhaustion! I kept your instructions in mind and worked strictly with Lizaru. Enforcing military law, since the brothers entered the city, there has not been a single incident of robbery or harm to the people of Larissa. How about it? Are you satisfied?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Matonis used his former title among the mercenaries to show his respect for Greece. Despite Ross's closeness, Xilos still said without pretense: "What's the point of satisfying me? The key is whether we can satisfy His Majesty and the Kingdom! The expedition to Thessaly is an important decision made by His Majesty and the Ministry of Military Affairs. Can we To completely conquer Thessaly and further control Greece, it depends on whether you can strictly implement the strategy formulated by the Ministry of Military Affairs!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this point, his eyebrows widened: "Commander Lizaru, Commander Matonis Officer, congratulations! From the landing to now, you have led the army to successfully achieve the original goal, making a good start for the next battle!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As he said, he solemnly clenched his right hand into a fist, put it against his left chest, and forcefully He lowered his head and gave a military salute to Matonis and Lizaru.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Matonis and Lizaru quickly and respectfully returned the favor. Not only Matonis, but Lizaru had also served under Hilos before. He respected the old officer, otherwise he would not have stayed with Matonis. Wait here for his arrival.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Xiros performed the military salute, he said seriously: "But I still want to remind you that time is of the essence in the landing raid operation. Although we have gained some advantages, you should not be satisfied and stay here to continue repairs. You should seize the time and lead your army to continue the attack, without giving the enemy a chance to breathe, occupy the entire territory of Thessaly as soon as possible, and initially achieve the strategic goals set by the Ministry of Military Affairs!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Matonis explained with some dissatisfaction: "It's not that we don't want to Seize the time and continue the attack, but the brothers fought continuously yesterday and their physical strength was extremely exhausted. They need sufficient rest before they can continue fighting. After discussing with Lizaru, I decided to assemble the army tomorrow morning and march towards Philae.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " Zaru then said: "Matonis is right. Many soldiers have not yet woken up from their sleep. They are indeed quite tired. We have sent the supply battalion to purchase cattle and sheep in Larissa and prepare to give the soldiers a meal. Okay, let them regain their strength as soon as possible..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course we have solemnly reminded the baggage officials that we must not buy or sell by force. We will follow the seller's wishes and conduct transactions according to the market price." Matonis quickly added .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hilos nodded, thinking of what he was going to do next, and said: "Matonis, since you are leaving tomorrow, lend me your armor to wear for a long time."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Why are you wearing my armor?" Matonis A little confused, he looked at Xilos and suddenly understood: "Oh... you are going to see your former friends and want them to know that you are now a big shot in the Kingdom of Theonia!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   That's right. I want them to know that my status is valuable now, so that they will be willing to cooperate with us and stabilize the order of Larissa faster!" Hilos said with a serious face.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It's not that he doesn't know that he has quit the army, and it seems inappropriate to wear the armor of the legion commander again, but as the regional administrator of the Senate, the pure white Bolton embroidered with black patterns he wears is in the eyes of the people of Theonia. It is a symbol of nobility, but in the eyes of the Larissa people, it may just be of good quality and nothing special. The general's armor directly shows his status, which can save a lot of words. For this reason, he also asked Ma Thonis borrowed a squad of guards.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Matonis didn't say anything and followed the instructions one by one. But when Hilos was about to leave the mansion, he finally couldn't help but asked: "Captain, when your Majesty gave us the order to raid Thessaly, he didn't do anything to Peleus." He gave you any special instructions... I wonder if he has any instructions for you about Peleus?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xiros stopped and answered without hesitation: "Yes!... His Majesty asked me not to do anything to the city of Peleus. If there is any special care, just manage it like other towns in Thessaly."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this point, he sighed softly: "However, I quietly sent someone to inquire about it yesterday... Back then, the Macedonians raided His Majesty's life In the village, all the villagers were killed and burned. The remains of his parents, like other corpses, were burned beyond recognition, and finally they were hastily buried together... Now it is a wasteland, overgrown with weeds, and no one remembers the burial place. The specific location..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Damn Macedonians!" Matonis roared angrily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Wearing the armor of Matonis and leading a heavily armed guard, Xiros headed to the civilian area of ​​Larissa, attracting attention along the way. He quickly found some of his former neighbors and friends.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   They were all surprised when they learned that Hilos, who had been away from Larissa for more than 30 years, had become an important minister of the Kingdom of Theonia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At that time, the young Hilos was helpful and good at fighting injustices, and he had a good reputation in the civilian areas. Therefore, although he returned to his hometown as an invader, he did not arouse the resentment of his former friends. Instead, they believed what he said " Theonia will implement some policies against the occupied Thessaly towns" and is willing to promote it for him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Theonia captured Rome more than 10 years ago, in order to win the trust of Roman civilians, Roman slaves were specially selected and entrusted with important tasks, which gradually dispelled the doubts of Roman civilians.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But now that Hilos is originally from Larissa and has a good reputation in the area, using similar methods to stabilize and govern Larissa will naturally get twice the result with half the effort.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ……………………………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Early on the third day, Matonis and Lizaru left 2,000 soldiers to assist Hilos in stabilizing order in Larissa and led the The main force left the city and marched eastward, encountering the eagerly approaching Thessalian army halfway.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Polyfulon, who had just received the news at first, was excited because he could defeat the main force of the Theonian army nearby without rushing to Larissa, but then he saw the black-helmeted and black-armored enemies in the distance. The steady surge caused Theonia's military formation to continue to extend to the two wings... He suddenly realized that the number of Theonia soldiers may far exceed 20,000, and they formed the formation quickly, obviously well-trained. white.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Polyfulon was a little panicked. Although he had always fought bravely, he was always under the command of his elder brother Jason. He had never had the experience of independently commanding such a large-scale battle. At this moment, he could only exclude the messengers. He urged the generals to arrange the military formation as soon as possible according to his deployment. He even rode an anxious horse to the rear of the military formation, shouting hysterically, "Let the soldiers speed up the formation. If anyone is slow to execute, the battle will be fought." There will be heavy punishment in the end!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just when this improvised army from the city-states of Thessaly was spreading out in a chaotic array, Theonia's military formation changed. It was suddenly disconnected from the center, and the distance became wider and wider. The bigger it was, the more it split into two parts, each corresponding to the left and right wings of the Thessaly army...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reason why the Theonian army did this was because Matonis and Lizaru were commanders of the same level. For the convenience of command and to avoid conflicts, the officers each commanded their own armies to fight; secondly, in order to disrupt the enemy's deployment, they deliberately brought the two armies together at the beginning.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The sudden change in the Theonian army's formation really confused Polyfulon, who was inexperienced. For a while, he didn't know how to deal with it, and at this moment the Theonian army launched an attack.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not long after the battle, the two wings of Thessaly's army suffered a rout, which quickly spread to the entire army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Polyfulon's rapid defeat was not only due to his inexperience and improper command, but also because his perverse actions aroused strong dissatisfaction among the citizens of Thessaly.
