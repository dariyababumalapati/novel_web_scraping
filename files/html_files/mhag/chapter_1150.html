   Chapter 1150 Agesilaus Knows the Truth
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Sparta faced danger, Xenophon chose to stay.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, he was a little surprised after hearing what Agesilaus said: "Let me serve as an envoy to Messenia?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This is my proposal, and other elders also agreed." Agesilaus looked like He solemnly said: "It can be seen that everyone agrees that in such a difficult situation, only you can perform the duties of an envoy!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xenophon did not feel proud of this, but looked ashamed: "But last time I The effect of the mission to Thurii... was not good, and the Theonians still declared war on Sparta..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It's not your fault!" Agesilaus comforted him, and then said in a deep voice : "In the period since we announced the end of the friendly agreement with Theonia, the country of Theonia has seemed calm, and there is nothing unusual. It was only when Thebes took the initiative to form an alliance with it that it was possible for Theonia to Asia has the idea of ​​sending troops to the Peloponnese, of course..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus sighed and said with a heavy heart: "If we can defeat the Thebans at Leuctra, maybe Dio Diaonia would not send troops to invade Messenia... When the lion falls ill, even wild dogs will come to bully it, not to mention that Theonia is a terrifying beast... Hey! I should have been more proactive at that time Ask for the command of the army!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xenophon knew that the fiasco at the Battle of Leuctra had a huge impact on Sparta. Many people resented Cleombrotus for his incompetence, and the Council of Elders has not yet done anything to help him. The funeral was held, and naturally a new king had not yet been elected from the Eulipontides royal family. Of course, this was also related to the urgency of the situation and the lack of extra time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Now that things have happened, any regrets will not help. We must face reality and do our best to solve the current crisis. Don't worry, I will do my best to complete this mission!" In order to comfort the depressed Agesilaus, Xenophon immediately made a promise, but at the same time he also said seriously: "You and I both know that the Kingdom of Theonia is powerful. The last time I sent an envoy to Thurii, I It shocked me a lot, even if this time we can finally defeat the Theonian army and recapture Messenia... But Sparta is not far from the Theonian Kingdom, and Theonian has complete Ability to continue to send troops to invade the Peloponnese, does Sparta want to continue fighting with Theonia? Even with the support of Persia, this is probably something Sparta cannot afford, right?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilao Si Li stroked his forehead with his hand, and after a while he whispered: "...For Sparta now, the most important thing is how to overcome the current difficulties... There is no time to think about the future..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xeno Fen was stunned. He looked at Agesilaus, who was half lying on a wooden chair, and found that the wrinkled face of this king who had been fighting for half his life looked particularly old at this moment, and his eyes also showed a little helplessness... ...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xenophon suddenly realized that Agesilaus, whom he had always considered wise and wise, was also powerless against the invasion of the Theonian army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He hesitated for a while, and finally plucked up the courage to suggest that Agesilaus should carefully consider making peace with Messenia after repelling the Theonian army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But at this moment, Archidamus walked into the living room: "Father, the Council of Elders invites you to a meeting."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I just came back from the meeting, why do I need to have another meeting?" Agesilaus was stunned.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Dolios is back, saying he brought important information."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Dolios didn't die in the battle?!" Agesilaus was surprised: because according to the soldiers who retreated, Dolios had already survived. He was willing to die in battle, so he stayed alone in Messenia... How could he still be alive?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I heard that he was released by the Theonians." Archidamus had a look of contempt. Like most Spartan warriors, Dolios did not lead the soldiers to fight to the death with the enemy, but ordered The army was very angry when they voluntarily abandoned Messenia. However, Dolios later bravely chose to stay, which made them less angry. But now they learned that Dolios did not die in the battle and became Dio. The Nian captives were even more disdainful of this man.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus once agreed with Dolios's approach. When the enemy is too strong and lacks preparation, it takes great courage and wisdom to dare to abandon Messenia to preserve strength instead of fighting head-on. , so he also regretted that Dolios finally chose to die in battle.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Go and get my staff!" Agesilaus said immediately, standing up with difficulty.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Father, don't be too anxious. They will wait patiently for you to go to the venue." Archidamus hurriedly stepped forward to support him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus wanted to arrive at the meeting venue early in order to protect Dolios and try to avoid him being criticized and punished by the censors. After all, these young censors who were ordinary citizens were not as mature and prudent as the elders and were too radical in their actions.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Given Agesilaus's current physical condition, it might be better to travel in a sedan chair, but in Sparta, where all the people were martial, there was no habit of riding in a sedan chair. Fortunately, Agesilaus's residence was not far from the council. , with the support of his son, he staggered towards the venue.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I met many Spartan people along the way, and they all said hello to the respected king. Most of them anxiously asked Agesilaus: When will the citizens be summoned to fight against Messenia and rush to Messenia? Where are the enemies going?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although they already knew that the Theonian army in Messenia was large in number, most of them, including old people and women, were not afraid, but full of fighting spirit.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, despite the excitement of the people, although they were a little dissatisfied after hearing Agesilaus's perfunctory words, they did not dwell on it, nor did they like other city-states, where whenever major events occurred, the citizens gathered to present their complaints to the council. protest.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before Agesilaus entered the council, he heard the censor's angry voice: You are sophistry!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The fact that there are too many Theonian soldiers landing is not a reason for you to retreat without a fight!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Why don't you learn from Bernacida!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the Athenians landed in Messenia, even though the number of soldiers they led was far less than the opponent's, he still chose to fight without hesitation, and finally won a complete victory!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Compared with him, you are not only weak, but also incompetent!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I don't know how you were selected into the King's Guard..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus hurriedly walked in. The moment he entered the venue, he immediately felt that the entire atmosphere was abnormal: the venue suddenly became quiet, and both the elders and Both the inspector and the inspector focused on him, and their eyes were very strange.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What did you say?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The commander of the Theonian army in Messenia was Leotychides?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "After listening to Dolios's story, Agesilaus shouted in disbelief.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Looking at King Agesilaus, who was rarely distracted, Dolios said in a deep voice with complicated emotions: "Although those Theonian soldiers called him Proseus, he is indeed Leoticid. Sis! I have been training with him since I was a child, and I will never admit a mistake, and he has admitted it himself!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Proseus..." Agesilaus was in a daze. He now knew why everyone in the venue was so confused. He looked weird.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "According to what we have learned before, Proseus was once the commander of the Eighth Legion of the Kingdom of Theonia. He once led the army to defeat the Carthaginians many times in the war between Theonia and Carthage. Theonia made great contributions in defeating Carthage, so after the war, he became the commander of the first legion of the Theonians' self-proclaimed 'strongest army'...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He also led the army to conquer the fierce army in northern Italy. A native Gaulish, he was called by the Theonians as 'the most victorious general after King Davos and Alexis'. Unexpectedly, he was actually a Spartan, and he was also an Archipelago. His son!" The speaker was Praxitas, an almost 70-year-old Spartan elder who once served as the regent of the Eulipontides royal family. He had always been against Agesilaus in the past, but he remained The failure of the Battle of Ketra caused many people to complain against the royal family of Eulipontides. Praxitas also became much quieter during the meeting. It was rare to encounter such a strange thing, which made Agesilaus frustrated. He stood up and spoke impatiently, with a look of gloating: Our Eulipontides family is in a bad situation right now, and you, the Aguidai family, don't even think about getting there!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Since Dolios said that Leoticides grew up in Sparta since he was a child and left only when he was 23 years old, he should still have some feelings for us Sparta. I wonder if we can send envoys to try our best. Convince him to take some actions that are beneficial to us?" A censor glanced at Agesilaus and then suggested.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You are still young and do not understand the situation at that time." One of the senators said, "Spartan citizens will not leave their hometown unless they are expelled for making mistakes. Leotychides must have extremely serious intentions." He fled Sparta out of resentment, and I even think... The reason why Theonia declared war on our Sparta, I'm afraid he played a big role in it." After that, he also looked at Agesilaus. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I don't think...Leotichides will actively encourage Theonia to attack Sparta..." Dolios also looked at Agesilaus and said hesitantly: "But he did tell me personally Said, he came for revenge..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Almost everyone in the venue would subconsciously take Agesilaus into consideration when discussing this topic.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   They knew that Leoticides became what he is today and was closely related to Agesilaus, but no one dared to point it out directly to his face, including Praxitas.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is related to the huge reputation that Agesilaus has established in Sparta over the past few decades. It is also because Cleombrotus died in battle and another new king has not yet ascended the throne. The people are more dependent on Agesilaus, who has outstanding abilities. Sri Lanka related.
