   Chapter 1106 Thessaly in Action
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to show his sincerity, Jason also stopped the siege and led the army back to Philae.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Faced with a difficult choice, the Pharsalians finally decided to make a last-ditch effort and sent Polydamas to Sparta for help.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the meeting of the Spartan elders, Polydamas told the Spartan elders and prosecutors everything in detail, and he also reminded: "If you Sparta decide to rescue our Spartan Sally, it's best to send out your most elite troops, because if you just send an army headed north by ordinary officers and mainly composed of freed helots, then it's best not to act rashly! Because Jason not only has a A powerful army, and he himself is also a shrewd, capable and far-sighted general. The battles he commands have never failed, so he will be a powerful enemy of Sparta!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Polydamas's speech ended , the Spartans did not make an immediate decision on this, but they obviously paid attention to it, and in the following period, they sent people to Thessaly to understand the situation, and at the same time made a careful count of the number of troops stationed overseas. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Finally, the Council of Elders gave Polydamas a clear answer: "Dear Polydamas, our main force of Sparta is either at war with the Athenian navy or with the Thebans. Therefore, we are currently unable to provide sufficient reinforcements for you, Pharsalus. However, we hope that the Thessaly allies headed by Pharsalus will not surrender to Jason easily, as long as you can resist the Philae army tenaciously. Invasion, as soon as our war with Thebes is over, we will immediately send powerful reinforcements to support!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Polydamas came to Sparta, he saw that its territory was sparsely populated, and he had expected it. Therefore, after receiving the definite reply from the Council of Elders, he did not show any surprise, disappointment or other negative emotions. He calmly thanked the Spartans for their frankness, and then set off to return home.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as he returned to Pharsalus, he called for a citizens' assembly to be convened immediately and informed everyone of Sparta's decision.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The disappointed citizens of Pharsalus finally made a decision after heated discussions.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Polydamas once again served as an envoy to Philae, met with Jason, and stated to him: "As long as Jason makes a promise not to harm the people of Pharsalus or occupy the land of Pharsalus, Without destroying the acropolis of Pharsalus, the people of Pharsalus are willing to become Jason's sincere allies and help him establish the rule of Tagus..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Jason was overjoyed after hearing this, and immediately made an appointment with Polydamas. Make an oath of alliance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Later, Polydamas even sent his own son to Jason as a hostage.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not long after, the Pharsalus people headed by Polydamas persuaded their close allies one after another. In the spring of 374 BC (the 19th year of the Kingdom of Theonia), envoys from the Thessalian city-states gathered in Phassal. Russ, together elected Jason Tagus of Thessaly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Jason became Tagus, he began to unify the city-states of Thessaly. While promising not to interfere in the internal affairs of the other Thessalian city-states, he also formulated a new Tagus law: no war should occur between city-states. Conflicts and disputes must be left to him for negotiation and adjudication; each city-state is not allowed to sign any agreement or join any alliance with other city-states, and all foreign affairs are decided by him; each city-state must pay tribute on time every year, and the amount paid will be determined by him according to each city-state. It is determined by the financial resources of the state; each city-state must provide a certain number of cavalry and heavy infantry. The specific amount is determined by him based on the strength of each state. In peacetime, he will regularly train these soldiers and lead them on expeditions in wartime...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, He also adopted Polydamas's opinions, unified and reduced commercial taxes between city-states, and allowed the free circulation of goods. This greatly strengthened the economic ties between the Thessaly city-states and made inland trade gradually become prosperous.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   By the end of the year, Jason had recruited more than 8,000 cavalry and no less than 20,000 heavy infantry from the entire territory of Thessaly, and the number of light shields was equivalent to that.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After further strengthening his strength, he immediately issued instructions to the various races and tribes in the mountains around Thessaly, asking them to follow the Thessalian Tagus Scopas determined during the Greco-Persian War decades ago. If he fails to pay tribute, he will be punished by his army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Some tribes were afraid of Jason's terrifying strength and chose to submit, while some rebellious tribes rejected his request.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, Jason decisively led his army to crusade, which also ignited the flames of war in Northern Greece.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time that Jason was elected as Thessaly Tagus, the Athenians encountered a dilemma: on the one hand, they saw their former enemy, their close neighbor Thebes. With his own help, Athens gradually became more powerful and stronger, but still refused to pay tribute to help maintain the expenses of the Athenian fleet; on the other hand, Athens' own finances were stretched due to various military expenditures. Of course, Even so, Athenian citizens are unwilling to cut theater subsidies.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, under the proposal of the chief general Callistratus and others, the citizens' assembly passed a resolution: to negotiate a separate peace with Sparta.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Soon Athens sent envoys to Sparta.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sparta was getting what they wanted: in the past few years, their army had been fighting in Boeotia. Although they had achieved some small victories, they had never been able to defeat Thebes. Instead, Thebes became stronger and stronger. Sparta's prestige has declined year by year, and it is now becoming increasingly difficult to fight against it.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Athenian navy was even more of a headache for Sparta. Not only were they unable to fight it, but they were also unable to prevent the Athenian navy from swimming in the Peloponnese waters as if they were just hanging out in their own back garden, attacking Sparta's allies wantonly, posing a serious threat. To the safety of Sparta's rear.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, an armistice agreement between Sparta and Athens was quickly signed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After being informed by the generals' executive committee, the Athenian naval admiral Timothyus, who was away at war, was preparing to lead his fleet back to Athens.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But on the way back, he landed on the island of Zakynthus without authorization, took control of the city-state on the island, and announced that the exiles of the city-state were allowed to return to their homeland (Zakynthus received the Spartan support drove out the democrats).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After learning the news, Sparta believed that Athens had violated the armistice agreement, so it called on its allies to jointly fund the formation of a fleet to protect the rights and interests of all allies in this sea area.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, Sparta also asked the new commander to lead the fleet to launch an expedition to Corcyra.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Corcyraeans, who were attacked, rushed to Athens for help.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Athens could not allow Kercyra, who had just joined the Maritime Alliance, to be bullied by the Spartans, otherwise Athens, as the leader of the Maritime Alliance, would inevitably lose the trust of its allies.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What's more, Corfu's unique geographical location controls the Gulf of Corinth and various city-states along the south coast of Corfu Island, making it the best base to launch an invasion of the Peloponnese from the west.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, this is also an important trade route between the Western Mediterranean and the Eastern Mediterranean, so it must not be given up.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For various reasons, the citizens of Athens did not elect Timothy as commander of the fleet this time, but chose Iphicrates, one of the Athenian generals.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a result, the armistice agreement reached between Athens and Sparta lasted less than a few months, and war broke out again.
  </font>

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The east side of the Adriatic Sea is constantly fighting, while the west side is a scene of peace and prosperity.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After entering September, after enjoying the joy of the harvest, the people of Theonia are looking forward to the Hades celebration that is coming soon. Every day, thousands of people flock to the largest city in the Western Mediterranean Thurii makes the center of the Theonian Kingdom bustling with excitement and joy every day.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was in this lively and suffocating atmosphere of joy that Okriton entered the city of Turiine.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the Western Mediterranean War, he has not been to Theonia again. This time he came to Thurii because the Theonia sent an invitation, requiring Carthage to send an envoy to participate, and the Hannoists There was something important to discuss with Theonia, so he forcibly appointed Okriton, who was still familiar with Theonia, to attend the Hades celebration.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Okridon had negotiated with Theonia on behalf of Carthage many times in the past, he had actually never been to Thurii, and this big city of hundreds of thousands of people shocked him more than Haka. It was even bigger in Turii, after all, the floating population in the city during the celebration was much larger than usual.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He stood on the bow of the ship, looking at the busy scene of countless docks on both sides of the Craty River, and couldn't help but wonder: If Carthage had won that war, would the city of Carthage also look like this?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But the facts cannot be changed, and thinking about it will only increase troubles. The more prosperous Thurii becomes, the more powerful the Kingdom of Theonia becomes. This undoubtedly adds a lot of difficulty to subsequent negotiations...Ok Liton frowned, lost in thought.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The boat sailed into the inner city of Turii, but stopped outside the pier, because many ships were already docked at the pier and were busy unloading. There was no extra pier for the time being, so there were still some passenger ships lined up in a long queue at the pier. They had to wait outside, and the passenger ship from Carthage arrived the latest, so they had to be last in line.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The entourage around Okriton took a small boat to go ashore to inquire about it. After returning, he reported: "Sir, I have inquired clearly. The Etruscan fleet is unloading now. They have arrived with 20 ships. I heard that most of the ships were loaded with bronze vessels, blankets, cloth, gold and silver products, olive oil, wine and other items. I heard a few Iberian crew members bragging at the dock that their alliance even served the King of Theonia. A golden crown was made, with many precious stones inlaid on it..."
