   Chapter 1263: A Different Race (3)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Silitaos was stunned and did not respond in time. The priest had to shout again, and he quickly responded: "Yes!" The priest
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   glared at him, but did not reprimand, and then continued Call the last name.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the six contestants were identified, the priest led them to the track.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The spectators saw the runners walking towards the track and realized that the race was about to begin, and immediately started cheering again.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Siliteos, who was walking at the front, even heard someone in the auditorium closest to him shouting: "Look, isn't that the athlete saluting His Majesty!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Siliteos suddenly felt countless eyes focusing on him. It was on him, and he even saw young women among the people paying attention to him...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While Silitaos lamented that "Theonian women are indeed as bold as the rumors," he suddenly felt that It is indeed necessary for the Theonians to ask them to wear shorts. At least he will not feel embarrassed when facing the gaze of women at this moment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not only did the extroverted Siriteos lose his nerves, but he immediately became inspired and strode forward with his head held high.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The sun shines down from the unobstructed center of the arena and shines on him: Although Siriteos is not very tall, he has a handsome appearance, with strong and well-proportioned muscles all over his body. The olive oil covering his skin reflects the sunlight, making his whole person shine. Flashing like a god.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Especially when he was running and warming up on his own track, the strength and beauty displayed by the contraction and relaxation of his muscles made many male viewers unable to help but admire him, and also made a few female viewers' eyes light up.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The players got used to the track and then returned to the starting line. They took the small shovels from the referee's hands and began to dig two small holes on the track.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What are they doing?" Some viewers were confused.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Harpius looked at it for a while and then said: "In the past, running competitions in the sports games had starting stones. It not only served as a starting mark, but the indents on the stone could help the players start well and avoid slipping. No. Although there is no starting stone on this track, I think these small pits also play the same role..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The spectators next to me suddenly realized.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, the athletes stepped their bare feet into the small pits at the front and back to make them firm so that they could use their strength when starting.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Two referees stood at both ends of the starting line, one responsible for giving orders, and the other responsible for supervising whether any players fouled.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A red cloth tape was also pulled up at the 100-meter finish line, and the atmosphere on the field began to become solemn.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Silitaos, who felt nervous again, looked at the player next to him. This was a foreign player who was not allowed to participate in other sports games at all, but could appear openly on the Theonia sports field, and The Theonia referee team also specifically stipulates that there must be no discrimination between players, otherwise they will be disqualified from the competition!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So Siriteos smiled at the player.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But this player from the Samonian Mountains was obviously participating in such a competition for the first time. He was obviously a little nervous and had no intention of paying attention to the goodwill conveyed by Siriteos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Silitaos, who was asking for trouble, cursed secretly and returned his attention to the upcoming game.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, I heard the referee shouting: "All players, please pay attention!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Siriteos immediately tensed up, half-bent, and leaned forward.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Ready--" The referee was about to give the starting order when a figure suddenly rushed out, causing other players to follow closely behind.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The referees finally stopped the game and called the player who violated the rules first. This player was the No. 2 player next to Siriteos. Although he begged in every possible way, the referee on duty did not hesitate to call him. Throw out.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The referees of the Theonian Games were so harsh on the illegal players, which not only made the players on the field feel frightened, but also made the spectators outside the stadium who were waiting to see the joke realize that the Theonians had declared in advance that "severe punishment would be required at the Games." "Athletes who cheat and violate regulations" seems to be serious.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Silitaos and the others returned to the starting line, feeling a little sluggish. Not only was their physical strength exhausted, but the ejection of the players was also a big blow to them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just then, a huge roar rang out from the audience, cheering them on and cheering them up again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Ready--" The referee raised his right hand again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   All the audience's eyes were focused on the contestants on the starting line, and they had this thought in their minds: The opening ceremony of the Theonian Games was wonderful, but when the real game started, was it just as exciting?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You can see the clues right away.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The referee waved his hand down hard: "Run!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The players were worried about being ejected again. They didn't rush out of the starting line until they heard the order clearly, almost half a beat too late.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But after starting, almost all the athletes immediately ran with all their strength, because after practicing some time ago, many athletes like Silitaos who had participated in previous games knew that the 100-meter race in the Theonian Games was comparable to other The shortest distance of the Games is half the distance, and if you don't give it your all from the start, you have no chance of winning.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Silitaos quickly waved his arms and stepped forward with his feet alternately. The huge oncoming wind pressure wrinkled the skin on his face. From the corner of his eye, he could see the ferocious faces of the players who were marching alongside him. , the rapid breathing was like a sword constantly stabbing behind him, urging him to move forward harder...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before he reached the halfway point of the race, he felt a tightness in his whole chest, like a ball of fire. Burning every lobe of his lungs, he couldn't help but roar: "Ah!!!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In previous sports meeting races, it was rare to see such a scene: all the competitors were roaring at the top of their lungs. , and with the continuous roar, their speed became faster and faster...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Almost all the audience were stimulated by this passionate scene and stood up, shouting and shouting. The sound waves erupted in the arena resounded throughout the entire scene. The city of Li made the Theonian people who could not buy tickets outside the arena feel itchy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Alex, who had been sitting sullenly at the back of the royal stand, suddenly rushed forward, clutching the railings with both hands, eyes wide open, staring at the runners running with all their strength, as if he wanted to reflect their figures. Engraved in his mind, he murmured to himself: "Great! Great! This is exactly what I want!..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Xenophon and Plato also looked surprised: too fast!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   They were faster than any runners they had ever seen in a race!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As Davos said, the 100-meter race can fully demonstrate the athletes' full sprint ability!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This display of the limit of human speed shocked the spectators in the stadium, making them stare at the sprinting players without even blinking.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The audience suddenly let out a cry of surprise.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It turned out that when he was about to reach the finish line, Siriteos, who had exhausted all his strength, suddenly lost his footing. Driven by the huge inertia, he rushed forward to the line while his whole body fell forward and fell to the ground.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The doctor who had been paying close attention to the situation on the field quickly rushed over and helped him up. After confirming that Siriteos only had some minor scratches and was not serious, the referee Kalsidis on duty walked over and lifted him up. He raised his right hand, indicating that the winner of the first qualifying round was Siriteos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since there are no accurate timing tools in this era, it is impossible to accurately test the time required for each athlete to run 100 meters, and then based on their qualifying results, the best ones will be determined for the finals. The only one in the Theonian Games is The way to do this and ensure fairness is to only allow the winners of each round of qualifiers to enter the semi-finals or finals, because in the end there will only be one champion, and there will be no runner-up or third place. This is in line with the tradition of the Rare Games.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the other eliminated contestants walked dejectedly towards the exit of the arena, the audience gave them warm applause and expressed their gratitude for such a wonderful game.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Silitaos, who walked at the end, still had dust on his face and a few bloodstains on his body, and looked a little embarrassed, the audience gave him even warmer cheers: this young man from Crete passed this. One game won the recognition of the people of Theonia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When dusk came, the day's competition finally came to an end. When he saw that many spectators around him were still discussing the opening ceremony and racing competition they had seen before, the messenger from Olympia had a complicated mood, even though he said He was picky, but he had to admit in his heart: Whether it was the opening ceremony or the subsequent running competition, he felt novel and exciting. The Theonia Games had indeed made a good start!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When many Theonian spectators walked out of the arena, they were surrounded by other familiar Turiyi people, asking about everything that happened in the arena, and these spectators were happy to share with them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So, after nightfall, candlelight illuminated the entire city of Thurii, and restaurants and pubs in the streets and alleys were crowded with guests. They drank wine, ate delicious food, and talked endlessly about what was going on in the Hatis Main Arena. The fun things that happened inside were full of laughter.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Such a lively scene also happened in the Theonia royal family.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos held a family banquet at the mansion on the hill to celebrate the success of the opening ceremony of the Theonian Games, but what everyone talked about the most at the banquet was the appearance of the two grandchildren Christode and Enon. Sensible performance at the sports meeting.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Faced with the endless compliments from their family members, the two teenagers were so shy that they even wanted to run away from the banquet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, the palace steward Ribazo quietly entered the restaurant, came to Davos who was sitting on the main seat, and whispered a few words.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos's smile remained unchanged, but he stood up.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
