   Chapter 1185 Fierce Debate at the Athens Citizen Assembly (2)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Although I have never been there, I have carefully understood and studied the affairs of the Kingdom of Theonia, and what I said is all true!" Callistra Tusi said firmly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Theonia is different from your Athens. The territory is too vast. To govern such a big country, of course, strict order must be established to ensure that any decisions and decrees are fully implemented." Karias said solemnly: "That's right. Thanks to the efforts of Theonian officials, all Theonian citizens have enough land and live relatively wealthy lives. Not only do they have enough bread for three meals a day, but they can also eat meat and meat regularly. Go to the tavern to drink, go to the bathhouse to soak in the hot springs, go to the arena to watch football matches, go to the theater to watch a play, go to the zoo to watch wild animals... The lives of the citizens of Theonia are rich and colorful, and they are also very hospitable. I hope that the people of Athens can go there. Traveling to the Holy Kingdom of Onia will definitely receive their warm reception, which will help our two countries eliminate misunderstandings and enhance friendship."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   His words caused a murmur of discussion among the citizens of Athens.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, a man stood up in the front row of the venue and shouted loudly: "The citizens of Theonia can own enough land, isn't it because you annexed the city-states of Magna Graecia and plundered their wealth? Really! While the citizens of Theonia were enjoying themselves happily, did they ever think of the people of Magna Graecia who had lost their homes and were suffering from hunger and cold?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus remembered that the person speaking was a student of Isocrates, and couldn't help but click nodded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Karias asked in surprise: "How did you come to this conclusion?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This is a fact, don't deny it!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Karias laughed: "I used to think that the Athenians were the wisest among the Greek city-states. , and the most inquiring spirit, but now I find that I was wrong, because some people really make up rumors to deceive everyone based on their likes and dislikes! If you really want to know the facts, you should go to the Western Mediterranean, Go to Crotone, Locle, Naples, Syracuse, Tarentum... and take a look around, and you will find that most of the people in these towns are still the same people from the original city-states. , but their situation has been greatly improved than before joining the Kingdom of Theonia, and their lives are richer-"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callistratus interjected again: "But you also said just now, Crow Thone, Tarantum, Locle... These sub-states that were once our Greek city-states all lost their independence and freedom, were annexed by Theonia, and became an ordinary town under your kingdom, even us Thurii, who is very familiar to the citizens of Athens, has become the center of the Kingdom of Theonia!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Callistratus mentioned Thurii, he deliberately emphasized his tone, causing a commotion in the venue, and then he looked Looking at Karias, he asked doubtfully: "Now that the Theonian army has set foot on the land of Peloponnese, aren't you holding the stories of the great Greek city-states such as Turui and Crotone? Repeat the purpose of making the whole of Greece eventually become the territory of your Kingdom of Theonia?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   His words aroused greater commotion in the venue, and some Athenian citizens even cursed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Callias twitched his face and did not immediately defend himself. Instead, he stood there without changing his expression. It was not until the citizens of Athens regained their composure that he sneered and said: "Callistra Lord Tus, I heard that you are a respected speaker, but your speech should respect the facts and not make up random things!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If you understand the situation in Magna Graecia, you should know that the Holy Kingdom of Theonia has not yet Before its establishment, the city-states of Magna Graecia were at constant war, which was not inferior to today's mainland Greece. Even Thurii you mentioned just now was not invaded by Theonia, but was occupied by another one you mentioned. The Magna Greek city-state Crotone was burned, and Theonia only rebuilt the city on the ruins of Thurii.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Theonia never took the initiative to invade any Magna Greek city-state, but continued to suffer from these Provocations and attacks from city-states, such as Crotone's two attacks on Theonia... The tyrant Dionysius led the Syracuse coalition to conduct a cross-sea expedition against the southern Italian city-states dominated by Theonia. ... Tarantum tore up the alliance at the critical moment when Theonia was defending against the Syracuse coalition and attacked Theonia's rear... and after Carthage, a foreign city-state, declared war on Theonia, Syracuse Lacusa actually colluded with them...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Theonia finally defeated these powerful enemies through hard battles, and these Magna Greek city-states joined the Kingdom of Theonia. Most of these city-states held citizens' assemblies, led by The people of the city-state made their own choices because they did not want to face war every day and were always afraid. They needed a strong supporter who could protect them from wind and rain. As

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   we all saw next, wars have continued in mainland Greece for more than 10 years. But during this period, there was always peace and tranquility in the territory of Magna Graecia, and the people's lives were prosperous. Facts have proved that the choice made by the people of Magna Graecia was not wrong!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Karias's last words were sonorous and powerful, and the venue suddenly changed. Be more silent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Uh-" Callistratus was about to interrupt again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Karias learned the lesson this time and quickly continued: "Of course Magna Graecia is Magna Graecia, and the mainland of Greece is the mainland of Greece. The situation is completely different. Theonia sent troops to the Peloponnese, and there is no other meaning. There are only two purposes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The first is what I just said, in order to fulfill the covenant, help Thebes and defeat Sparta who is constantly causing war in Greece; the second is to help the Messenians. I remember that Athens was once kind. He has helped the Messenians who were enslaved by the Spartans many times, and our king has also made a promise to the Messenians who were exiled to Tyndares, so he takes this opportunity to , to let the Messenians, who are also Greeks, regain their freedom and independence.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I can swear to the gods that when Sparta is defeated, the Theonian army will quickly withdraw from the kingdom and will never occupy the Greek mainland. Not even a speck of land!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Karias raised his hands flat, palms toward the sky, and finished speaking solemnly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Many Athenian citizens were moved.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Suddenly a voice sounded: "The Theonian envoy is swearing to the gods, can you tell us which god it is?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Karias saw an old man standing in front of the venue. He had white hair and a face Because he was too dark, he looked a bit eerie.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He hesitated for a moment, and then said calmly: "God Hades!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I heard that Theonia regards Hades as the protector of your kingdom. Is the Hades you believe in Hades, one of the twelve main gods of Greece?"
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The man continued to ask.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Of course.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Karias said cautiously: "It's just that Theonia's understanding of Hades is somewhat different from that of the native Greek people.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The man did not ask what the difference was, but said seriously: "We Greeks believe that Hades is in charge of death and is inaccessible. Ordinary people don't even dare to call him by his name, but use 'that male god' instead." Aecilius

 <br/>

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   has no temple in Hades on the mainland of Greece. The only temple that has no idols or engraved names but is closely related to Hades is in Eleusis in the Attica region of Greece, where there is A bottomless cave is recognized by the Greeks as the entrance to hell. For this reason, we Greeks have established a secret ceremony to worship Hades. Almost all celebrities in Greece have participated in this ceremony..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Eleusis, I know."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "No, you don't know! You Theonians don't know at all!" The man roared: "Eleusis originated in Athens and got the tacit approval of Hades , so it is widely revered and respected by the Greek people. It is the most orthodox sacrifice dedicated to Hades in the entire Greek world!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But you Theonians are building Hades statues and temples wantonly. Not only are there no He was in awe of Hades, and even made up lies about the descendants of Hades to deceive the people..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Shut up!" Karias yelled, his beard stretched angrily, and he glared at the man: "Our great Dai The fact that King Fos is a descendant of Hades is the consensus of all people in the Kingdom of Theonia! In just 30 years, he went from a mercenary to the king of the most powerful country in the Western Mediterranean, turning Theonia from A small alliance turned into a powerful kingdom that encompassed the entire Western Mediterranean civilized city-states. It was precisely because of the divine inspiration and blessing from Hades. At several critical moments, Hades even performed miracles to help the kingdom tide over difficulties. These have been witnessed by thousands of people in the kingdom, so the citizens of the Holy Kingdom of Theonia will willingly worship Hades as the protector of the kingdom and become a devout believer in Hades!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hades is a benevolent person He does not care about the different sacrificial methods adopted by Greek people in different regions because of their different views on him, but if someone openly slanders his son of God and insults the people of Theonia's pious belief in Hades, then Dai The millions of devout followers of Hades in Onia will not be afraid of hardship, life or death, and will definitely make the blasphemers pay a heavy price!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Under the pressure of Karias's majestic aura, the man turned out to be a little timid and subconsciously He stepped back, completely forgetting that there was a stone staircase behind him, and he almost fell down if it wasn't for the help of the people next to him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This man is the torch bearer of the Eleusis Secret Council, and has a similar name to the Theonian envoy-Callias. The "Callias Peace Treaty" signed in Sparta was named after him. Named after him, it can be seen how prominent his reputation is in Greece.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But at this moment, his poor performance made Callistratus frown: Hades, what a good topic to criticize, but it's a pity that Callias messed it up!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He also performed poorly when the peace treaty was signed with Sparta, and I should have known better than to expect anything from him.
