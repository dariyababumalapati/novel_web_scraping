   Chapter 1096: Observations of the Kingdom's Senate (continued)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not far in front of it was the only black wooden table in the venue. Behind the wooden table was a smaller ivory chair.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   According to what Haka learned, that should be the seat of the rotating chairman who was in charge of presiding over the meeting that day.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Around the central open space, the terrain rises in steps like an arena, with a total of 20 floors. Each step is neatly and tightly arranged with countless wooden chairs, layer upon layer, making Haka feel dizzy. , they surround the central throne like stars holding the moon.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, there were already some people sitting in the venue. Some people noticed Haka following the etiquette officer. They saw several people standing up quickly in the center of the front row of the venue and walking towards Haka together. The leader was Lu There are 5 rotating presidents: Sias, Sipulos, Cedorum, Antaoris, and Hermon.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Master Haka, welcome! I heard that you were ill a few days ago, and we were embarrassed to visit you. Are you feeling better now?" Lysias greeted with concern.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I'm really ashamed that I made you worry. I'm fine now." Haka said apologetically: "Today is my first time attending a meeting. I thought I could arrive early, but depending on the situation, I seem to be late."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You're not late." Sipulos explained: "It's just that a few of us are used to arriving early because we need to communicate and discuss the issues to be discussed that day in advance to avoid surprises..." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then there will be meetings in the future. When the time comes, I will try my best to arrive as early as possible." Haka answered knowingly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Let's not block the entrance of the passage and affect the entry of people behind us. Let's return to our seats first and then talk in detail." Antaoris reminded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Several people took Haka to the front row. Haka immediately noticed that there were 6 white chairs that stood out among the almost all black chairs.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is the ivory chair exclusively for the rotating chairman!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So unusual, what does it also mean about the status of the rotating president in the Senate?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ...Haka was thinking in his mind when he saw Sipulos pointing to the seat on his left and saying: "Master Haka, your seat is here."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka walked over and sat down, and suddenly realized that this seat really belonged to him. Yes, because the name 'Haka' was engraved on the ground he stepped on, and when he looked around, there were also names engraved under the seats around him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sipulos saw his actions and immediately explained: "You cannot sit on the seats in the venue casually. Each seat is dedicated to a senator, and the name of the senator will be engraved under the seat. If during the meeting, If the senators sit in disorder, the etiquette officer will warn them. If they do not listen to repeated warnings, they will be expelled from the venue."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka nodded, secretly alert.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Actually, ten years ago, apart from some special seats, you could sit anywhere in the venue." Antaoris stuck his head out and said, "So every time there was a meeting, familiar elders would sit together. There are people in the east and west, and they are very scattered, and they like to gather together to discuss, and the order is chaotic, which makes the meeting inefficient... Later, Master Cesta made suggestions in response to this, and it was passed, and it became what it is now. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka nodded again. During this time, he studied the political arena of Theonia in detail and knew that Sesta was the Kingdom's Supervisory Minister. He had been in this position for almost 20 years. It is said that he was cruel and had punished many people. Officials, even senators, many officials are afraid of him, but most people respect him and call him "Aeacus of the Kingdom" (one of the three judges of Hades).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Under Antaoris's pointed fingers, Haka saw an old man sitting in the same row not far away from them. Viewed from the side, his body was straight, his eyebrows were thick and long, his nose bridge was very straight, his nose wings were big, his lips were Very thick, eyes not big.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Is this Sesta?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ...Haka was thinking about it when the old man turned his head and met his eyes. Haka immediately felt the light bursting out of the other person's small eyes, like a sharp blade piercing his own eyes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But then the old man dimmed his light again, and his serious face became somewhat peaceful. He nodded to Haka, then stood up, walked towards a etiquette officer in the venue, and said a few words to him, The order officer immediately ran out of the venue.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It seems that Sesta felt that the senators were entering the venue too slowly and asked the etiquette officer to urge them to enter the venue faster." Antaoris sighed and introduced: "Lord Haka, you come to every Senate meeting. The first one was not us, but this old guy. Although this is also his responsibility, it has been like this for 20 years, which really has to be admired... I really don't know if the next Minister of Supervision can do like him!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ha !
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ka looked at Sesta's back standing in front of the venue, like a solid stone pillar, and suddenly asked: "Lord Sipulos, you just said that a seat is dedicated to a senator, but if this senator is no longer there, , this name..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "This name will be covered with cement, and after it solidifies, it will be engraved with the name of the new senator..." Sipulos said with some emotion, but gently rubbed one foot on the ground. With.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Only then did Haka notice that the color of the ground with his name engraved on it was different from the surroundings. He heard Sipulos whisper: "This seat used to belong to Lord Cornelus..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka was speechless after hearing this. For him who has been suffering from illness for many years, he also has deep feelings.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lord Haka, there are currently 615 senators in the Senate. It will be difficult to remember them all in a short time." Antaoris suggested to him: "But you can remember the main senators first. For example, the ministers of various departments in the kingdom have their seats on both sides of us; the senators when the Kingdom of Theonia was established, they are the oldest and their seats are in the first two rows; there are also the town administrators who serve all year round and these The veterans who were promoted to legion commanders only at the age of 18 sit in the third to sixth rows..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Haka listened carefully and asked: "So, my brother Hasdrubal will sit at the back? "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course not." Lysias interjected: "Due to the special situation of Lord Hasdrubal, after the banquet last night, His Majesty specially discussed with us and finally arranged a special seat for him. I believe it will make people happy." He is satisfied."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Where is his seat?" Haka was curious.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Hasdrubal walked into the venue, the venue was already crowded and extremely lively.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Without the ceremonial officer to guide him, he had no idea where he was going.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lord Hasdrubal, this is your exclusive seat. From now on, you will sit here when attending Senate meetings." After the etiquette officer finished speaking, he turned and left.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is the leftmost seat in row 3.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hasdrubal stood in front of his seat. He felt that the oppressive feeling of being stared at by the people around him when passing through the passage was significantly reduced, and he felt a little at ease.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As soon as he sat down, the person in front turned his head: "Master Hasdrubal, we meet again!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hasdrubal took a closer look and saw that it was Aminta who had a great chat with him last night. Sri Lanka.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Lord Hasdrubal, I was still a little dizzy after having a drink with you yesterday." The man next to Amyntas also turned his head. He was also another person Hasdrubal met at the banquet last night. Matonis, a Theonian general.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "You're not afraid of being embarrassed by saying it. With your drinking capacity, you can't even compete with me!" Amyntas mocked.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "As long as I can beat you in wrestling." Matonis retorted not to be outdone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the two were about to quarrel, the senator next to Hasdrubal turned around and said with a smile: "Hello, Lord Hasdrubal, I am Tygtilos, commander of the seventh legion of Theonia. ."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Taking into account Hasdrubal's character, Devos specially called Amyntas and Martonis to accompany him at the banquet last night.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Amyntas competed with Hasdrubal in the city of Selinus. Although Theonia won in the end, the process was quite fierce. As the saying goes, there is no acquaintance without fighting. Amyntas was defeated by Hasdrubal. A bit sympathetic.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What's more, the year before last, he had some mobility difficulties due to his old age and too many old injuries, so he had to resign from the position of commander of the First Army. As a result, Davos appointed someone who was not part of the expeditionary force group and had less qualifications than them. Leotyzides took over, which made Amyntas a little unwilling. Hasdrubal was the only person who defeated Leotyzides head-on in that war, and his character was very favorable to him. Appetite, coupled with his special background, so under Amyntas' deliberate win over, he, Matonis and Hasdrubal had a great time drinking last night.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hasdrubal, who has been fighting in the Iberia region for more than ten years, is also willing to stay with Theonian generals such as Amyntas and Matonis, not only because they have similar interests, but also have many topics to talk about. , but also because after the banquet last night, Davos had a special talk with him and gave him an appointment, which finally made this former Carthage general who had been idle for several years due to decadence finally cheer up and make him realize Having a good relationship with the Theonia military headquarters will help him perform his mission.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Both parties were interested in making good friends, so the atmosphere quickly became warm, making Hasdrubal no longer feel like he was in a strange environment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Majesty is here!" With a loud shout, the closed wooden door in the center of the venue opposite Haka opened.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The originally noisy venue suddenly became quiet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Four palace guards in military uniforms emerged from the door, guarding King Davos, who was wearing a crown, as he entered the venue.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The elders in the venue quickly stood up, and Hasdrubal also stood up reluctantly under the tug of Tagtilos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It wasn't until Davos sat on the throne that the senators sat down one after another.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, the palace guards stood around the throne, and the ceremonial officers affiliated with the Ministry of Supervision also took their positions. The three record-keeping officers of the venue sat on the edge of the center of the venue with pens and papers in hand. The rotating chairman Antaoris stood up and Walking to the host table...everything is ready.
