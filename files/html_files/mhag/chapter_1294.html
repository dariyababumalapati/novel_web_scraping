   Chapter 1294: The Great Battle of Cyprus (1)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sekerian shook his head gently and said calmly: "The reason why Your Majesty asked us to take great risks and travel a long way here is to capture Cyprus is only a secondary purpose, the most important thing is It is to destroy the Persian fleet and control the dominance of the Near East waters... Now more than 4,000 heavy infantry have landed, which has posed a great threat to Cyprus and destroyed the Persian fleet's attempt to intercept us at sea. In this situation Under such circumstances, they are likely to choose to temporarily retreat when faced with the threat of our powerful fleet in Theonia, and instead transport reinforcements and supplies to towns such as Nicosia on the island so that they cannot be easily attacked by us. The army conquered it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After all, our fleet came over a long distance, and the supplies it carried could not guarantee the consumption of supplies by our fleet's huge crew. If the army could not quickly capture Nicosia and other towns, our fleet would have to retreat first, and then... ...Huh, the Persian fleet can easily cut off the maritime supply line of the landing army, and then the army will be in big trouble -"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this point, Sekerian's face became very serious: "The army's unluckiness is second, the key is This time, His Majesty personally led the army to obtain the great honor of conquering Persia. Our navy has been given the important task of destroying the Persian fleet and gaining maritime dominance in the Eastern Mediterranean. If the task of luring the enemy fails due to passive avoidance of war, it may even lead to the first battle. The defeat affected the entire war to conquer Persia. I have betrayed His Majesty's trust and even had no words to meet those army generals I once laughed at!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It's not that serious..." the flagship captain murmured. said.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sekerian glared at him with dissatisfaction and said in a deep voice: "I am the commander of this operation. I must seize every possible opportunity to ensure that the operation can proceed smoothly, so we must stay here and cannot leave. ! For the Persian fleet, what could be more attractive to them than to destroy a Diorian fleet that is far smaller in number than them, and at the same time completely besiege thousands of Diorian army on the island! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Sir, we have too few warships after all. I am worried that the Persian fleet... will really treat us as a delicacy and eat us in
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   one bite-" The captain stammered and was interrupted by Sekerian sharply: "Even if the number of Persian warships is two or three times that of ours, the fleet led by Sekerian will definitely be a hard stone that will break the teeth of the Persian fleet! What's more, I believe in Midorades, he not only He has rich experience in naval battles and has good intuition. He will definitely lead other warships to join us in time and jointly annihilate the Persian fleet!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Sekerian made up his mind, the flagship captain did not dare to persuade him anymore, and instead sent the fleet to The commander's order is conveyed to all warships: all crow warships are equipped with drawbridges and ready for battle!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   More than an hour later, no trace of the enemy ship was found, but a small number of Cypriot cavalry appeared on the island. They spied on the Theonian Legion soldiers building camps near the beach from a distance, but they never dared to get close. It seems that the Cypriots have no intention of gathering their troops and fighting a decisive battle with the landed Theonian army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, the Theonian Legion that landed also had no such intention. What they have to do now is to hold on to the landing site and facilitate the arrival of subsequent troops.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "The clipper to the south has raised a yellow flag!" the lookout on the flagship mast suddenly shouted loudly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sekerian, who was waiting anxiously, did not feel excited. Instead, he murmured to himself in confusion: "There are fewer Persian warships than us?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing Sekerian's dissatisfied expression, Instead, the captain of the flagship let out a breath and asked, "Sir, do you want to inform all the warships to prepare for battle?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sekerian paced back and forth on the deck, thought for a while, and then said in a deep voice: "Wait a little longer. Wait! Let all the clippers be divided into two parts. One part will bypass the Persian warships and continue to explore south, and the other part will explore north." The
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   flagship captain's heart moved: "Sir, do you suspect that the Persian fleet has divided its forces?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sekeli An calmly replied: "I don't think the Persians are so bold as to lead a small number of warships to attack us. What's more, I firmly believe that our fleet can easily defeat this number of enemy ships without making too many preparations. Defeat them all!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just when the crew on the southernmost warship of the Theonian fleet could see the outline of the enemy ship in the distance, the Theonian clippers heading south quickly changed the flags on the masts. Pass information back to the fleet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Two yellow flags!" The lookout's shout made Sekerian remain silent. On the contrary, the flagship captain heard another report from the lookout and tightened his fists nervously: "The Persian warship is not far away from us. To four miles!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He looked at Sekerian, who was sitting on the deck like a clay sculpture, and hesitated several times.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this moment, the lookout's voice sounded again: "Three yellow flags! The clipper ship in the south has raised three yellow flags! There has been no change in the north!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sekerian suddenly jumped up: "Three yellow flags! The Persian warship The number of them exceeds ours, which means that their main force is here and the Persians have taken the bait!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sekerian danced with excitement and immediately said the battle plan he had already thought about: "Blow the bugle and let all the warships Arrange in a circular formation and conduct defensive operations!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "A circular formation?!" The flagship captain was slightly startled.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "What? You think I can only attack but not defend?!" Seclian said with a half-smile.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I'll convey it right away!" The worries in the flagship captain's heart were relieved. Obviously, the fleet commander he respected did not lose his cool because of the arrival of the fighter plane.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "By the way, arrange all the iron ships at the forefront of the circular formation, facing the direction of the Persian fleet's attack!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This Persian fleet headed by Phoenicia and Cyprus has nearly a thousand warships and is stationed at various military ports in eastern Cyprus. After receiving the order from Alitaka, the Cypriot crew took the most action Positively, they boarded their warships as quickly as possible, rushed out of the military port, and then set off to the west along the coast of Cyprus Island without waiting for the warships behind them to form a formation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When Yalitaka's flagship sailed out of the military port, he discovered that many warships, led by the Cypriots, did not stop after leaving the port and headed west like a swarm.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As the commander of the fleet, Yalitaka was so angry that he stamped his feet, but he had nothing to do about it. He could only secretly curse the Cypriots for being stupid. At the same time, he looked forward to the fact that when the entire fleet arrived at the west coast of Cyprus Island, the Theonian fleet had not yet arrived. He still had time to regroup the fleet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Persian fleet had already formed a long column after leaving the port. During the journey, due to the different levels of input of the crew members belonging to various regions of Persia, the long column gradually began to become disconnected, with the Cypriot warships at the forefront. , the Phoenicians are in the center, and other warships such as Syria are at the end...The Cypriot warships in the front are also out of touch, and the warships coming out of the Larnaca military port in the west are at the forefront... ...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After more than three hours of sailing, the Cyprus warship rounded the westernmost promontory of the island from the south. With the help of the south wind, the speed accelerated again. After only 20 minutes, the Cyprus warship looked at The players saw the Theonian fleet staying in the bay, the numerous Theonian cargo ships docked on the beach, and the Theonian soldiers who kept walking from the cargo ships to the beach (actually, the Theonian soldiers came and went. The materials on the cargo ship were transported. Due to the long distance and psychological effects, the Cyprus lookouts had an illusion).
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Deolians are landing!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ...This news made all the Cypriot crew members feel nervous. Their belief in defending their homeland made them forget their fatigue and made them feel the urgency of the situation.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   According to military orders, they should stop advancing after discovering the Theonia fleet, join other warships, and then follow the orders of the fleet commander to launch an attack.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But at this moment, under the command of the Cyprus naval admiral, they only slowed down during the process of changing formations. After completion, they continued to accelerate, launching a double-column formation towards the Theonia fleet. .

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   During the Greco-Persian War, the warships of the city-states in the Near East were famous for their large and heavy hulls and large crews. As a result, they were defeated by the small and flexible Greek coalition warships in the Battle of Salamis, and later Athens In the process of expanding to the eastern Mediterranean, it was repeatedly defeated by the Athenian navy, forcing the city-states in the Near East to abandon their large and inappropriate warships and rebuild a fleet with triremes as the main body, even the Phoenician city-states. So later on, only Carthage in the Western Mediterranean still used those double-headed dragon warships, four-layered oar warships, and five-layered oar warships. The composition of the Persian fleet, which was based on the city-states in the Near East as the main naval force, was completely the same as that of Athens. The fleet was united.

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, although the Cypriot warship had lowered its sails, the sailors were rowing hard, and the warship's forward speed was accelerating. Soon the Theonia warship was close at hand, and the Cypriot crew on the deck was even there. During the nervous maneuvering, they looked curiously at the tall and swaying Crow Suspension Bridge on the enemy ship ahead. Although they had not fought against the Theonia fleet before, they had also heard of the strange Theonia navy. The warships were somewhat on guard.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the Theonian warship almost just rotates in place, the warships on both sides are always bow to bow. At this time, the Cyprus warship does not want to perish with the other party, so the helmsman turns the rudder slightly, and the captain simultaneously faces the bottom cabin Shout: "Put the oars back!"
