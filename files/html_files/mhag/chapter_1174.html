   Chapter 1174 Rushing to the battlefield
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Your Highness, we cannot retreat!" Printors immediately objected: "Now the Spartan army is about to engage in battle with us. If we retreat at this time, not only will the soldiers have complaints, but they will also Let our previous efforts be in vain, let the Spartan army breathe, let other Greek city-states look down on us, and it is more likely to speed up their formation of an alliance with the Spartans and jointly fight against us. If we want to defeat us again The Spartan army will undoubtedly become more difficult!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not only can we not retreat now, we should also speed up the attack on the Spartan army before these Greek city-states are ready for military preparations. As long as we can defeat Sparta , the situation will become favorable to us!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After all, it was the first time for Clotokatax to lead an army. He lacked experience, and bad news happened to come one after another. He panicked for a while, and it was inevitable that he would fall under the pressure. Choosing to be conservative, after being reminded by Printors, he immediately realized that if he did this, it would undoubtedly lead to the prolongation of the war, which would not only greatly consume the national power and increase casualties, but also make his father, who has always been enterprising in the war, Disappointed with himself...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thinking of this, he cheered up and immediately changed his mind and said: "Lord Printors, you are right, we should step up our attack on the Spartan army, but what should we do specifically?!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Highness , First of all, we should send a messenger to inform our troops stationed in Messenia, let them strengthen the defense of the northern border, and be ready to carry out military mobilization against the Messenians at any time." Printors patiently suggested: " Secondly, we should detach some reconnaissance cavalry and reconnaissance soldiers to explore westward, not only the situation in the Ellis area, but also the movements of the Acadian Alliance army, just in case.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then, Your Highness, you have to write a letter to tell Se Cleon, given the predicament we are in now, urges him to launch an attack on the Spartan coast and achieve landing as soon as possible.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, we lead the main force eastward into the Tegea territory. We will not take the initiative to attack the Spartan camp first, but instead The border between Tegea and Sparta pretended to build a new camp, forcing the Spartan army to leave the camp and fight with us." "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If the Spartan army cannot leave the camp, they want to unite with the Elis army, and then fight with us. Shall we have a decisive battle?" Crotokatax couldn't help but ask.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Then we will really build a camp there, block the Spartans' way home, and then send some soldiers to cooperate with the fleet soldiers of the first fleet to invade the Spartan territory from the north... I think the Spartans I never want to see such a situation happen." Printors said calmly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After listening to Printors' words, Clotokatax fell into deep thought and did not respond for a long time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors couldn't help but ask: "Your Highness, do you think there are any shortcomings in my plan?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax heard that Printors was a little dissatisfied, and said apologetically: "Lord Printors, your suggestion is very good, I have no objection! I'm sorry, I was a little distracted just now, because your plan inspired me and gave me an idea."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Krotokata Kes's initiative to admit his mistake not only made Prentols' grudge disappear, but also made him feel guilty that he was too petty, so he asked seriously: "May I ask if your highness has any good ideas?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "I saw Greece in detail when I was in Thurii. In the past history of the major local city-states, the reason why Ellis expressed goodwill to us before was because although it was a member of the Peloponnesian League, it had suffered due to Leprion's victory during the Peloponnesian War. Belonging, had a grudge with Sparta. Before the Corinthian War, the Spartan army invaded the territory of Ellis and forcibly occupied some of its territories. After the signing of the 'Great King's Peace', Sparta even supported Pisa, The rights to host the Olympia Games originally owned by Ellis were forcibly transferred to Pisa... Since then, the Ellis people hated Sparta, so when they learned that our army was going to fight Sparta, They were very happy and sent Ionicus to Messenia with the fleet.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now the reason why Elis agreed to join the Greek alliance against us is probably because Pisa voluntarily surrendered to it, giving it a chance to finally Completely unify the western region of the Peloponnese. But it forgot that if we were really defeated and withdrew from the Peloponnese, once Sparta regained its strength, it would still compete with it for dominance in the western region. ...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So we should send diplomat Carias to Ailes and make a promise to them, 'Ailes may not necessarily be required to support us, but as long as Ailes can remain neutral, Theonia will support Ailes. Lis became the leader of the western Peloponnese region'... Even if the Ayles do not agree with our suggestions in the end, they will hesitate and argue because of this, thus delaying military mobilization against us... Printors My lord, what do you think?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax's suggestion made Printoles, who only focused on the military aspect, brighten his eyes and praised sincerely: "Your Highness, your suggestion is really wonderful! I We feel that we can not only send Carias as an envoy to Elis, but also send him as an envoy to other city-states, thus disrupting the situation in Greece that is beginning to be unfavorable to us..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ……………………………… …………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotocathus and Printoles were rushing to implement their plan, but on the second day they received news from the scouts: the Spartan army was attacking Tiger Asia City.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Spartan army's proactive attack made Printors feel that this was a good opportunity for a decisive battle with the Spartan army, so at his suggestion, Crotocathax left 3,000 soldiers to garrison the camp and led The army came to the rescue.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The road leading to Tegea is a narrow, undulating mountain road with higher hills on both sides. The experienced Printols did not let Crotokatax take the risk, but suggested that he go first. They sent a mountain reconnaissance team to explore the surrounding situation, and sure enough they found a Spartan army ambushing in the mountains.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a result, Clotokatax sent a mixed force composed of light armor and light infantry to take the initiative to attack the Spartan army ambushing on the hill.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The battle was not too fierce. This Spartan army did not have Spartan warriors. They were mainly mercenaries and had no heavy infantry. After their whereabouts were exposed, they faced well-trained Theonian light armor and light infantry. Cooperating with the tacit attack, they quickly chose to retreat.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the fighting in the mountains delayed time. Seeing that it was almost dusk, the Theonian army had to choose a place to camp and rest.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Early on the morning of the third day, the Theonian army began to continue marching, but in order to prevent the ambush and harassment of the Spartan army, the marching speed was not fast. It was not until the morning that the leading troops entered the Tegea territory.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Tegea-Mantinia Plain is a rare and relatively large flat land in the Arcadia region. It is a long and narrow area running from north to south, with rivers running through it. The land is relatively fertile and is the entire Peloponnese. The peninsula is a famous wheat growing area and is also the granary of Acadia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The soldiers trekked through the mountains and came to the plains with wide views. They saw green wheat fields everywhere, undulating like waves in the breeze, and they were all refreshed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crotokatax had no time to enjoy the scenery, because he had already received a report from the scout cavalry: the Spartan army was storming the city of Tegea. The battle was very fierce. Judging from the situation, the Tegea people suffered heavy casualties. I can't resist it anymore.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Printors and the generals had analyzed beforehand: Tegea had been under the protection of the Spartans for a long time, and unlike the Mandinians who had not built their own city walls as carefully as the Mandinians, its city walls had not been maintained for a long time. There are no trenches or other defensive facilities outside the city, but after all, Tegea is one of the largest states in Arcadia with a large population, so it should be able to hold on for a while.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   How could it stop working so quickly?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But the scouts who returned one after another all reported the same situation: the Spartan army completely surrounded the city of Tegea. The Spartan soldiers had attacked the city of Tegea several times. There were corpses everywhere under the city... ...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It seems that there is no doubt that under the attack of tens of thousands of Spartan army soldiers, the city of Tegea is in danger!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax and Printors must not allow the city of Tegea to fall into the hands of the Spartans, because first of all, it is still spring, and the people of Tegea still have plenty of food in their homes. This can This greatly alleviated the food shortage of the Spartan army; secondly, Sparta captured the city of Tegea in the center of the plain, established a foothold on this plain, and could continue to threaten Mandinia to the north. Gained a certain strategic initiative.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, Crotokatax issued an order: "Speed ​​up the march and advance towards the city of Tegea!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, the Theonian prince also added an order: "Try not to trample the wheat fields!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   " Geya City is only a dozen miles away from its southwest edge, and its terrain is flat, and the Theonian army is advancing faster. By noon, the leading troops can already see the outline of Tegea City in the distance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Clotokatax received another report from the reconnaissance cavalry: most of the Spartan army had withdrawn from the siege, and began to arrange the soldiers to face west and form an array.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Spartans are now preparing for a battle with us!
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ...Klotokas saw that the goal he was seeking was about to be achieved so soon. He was happy at first, and then felt nervous. After all, the upcoming battle will determine the success or failure of the Theonian army and thousands of soldiers. life and death.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, Printors was much calmer. He suggested that the army suspend its advance, and at the same time asked to go to see the Spartan army's formation at close range.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing this, Clotokatax also expressed his intention to go, and also blocked the mouths of the persuaders with the reason that "my father often went to the battle to observe in person".
