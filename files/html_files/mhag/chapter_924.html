   Chapter 924 Stolo's tangle
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mejius next to him pushed him and whispered: "What are you doing standing still? Hurry up and translate for us! What did he say?!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos heard the whispers around him. He didn't care and continued: "Just after our army landed in Latium and captured Rome, the old Roman dictator was still fighting tenaciously, even ignoring his relatives who fell into the trap. Even though he was seriously ill and bedridden, he still tried his best to fight to regain Rome. Even when he fought until the last moment of his life, he wrote a letter of surrender for the safety of Roman citizens regardless of the damage to his reputation. ... Camillus has always loved his mother state and devoted himself wholeheartedly to the people of his mother state. He is a hero of Rome! He should also be an example for our generals and officials in Theonia to learn from! His soul can return to the kingdom of God and find peace!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos finished speaking with a solemn expression, raised his hands flat, palms to the sky, and bent down to salute again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Aulus did not expect that a foreign king would have such a high opinion of Camillus, which made his face slightly hot. He couldn't help but remember that he had secretly conspired with Quintus in an attempt to seize Camillus. Si's command of the army could not help but feel guilty, and he loudly translated what Davos said.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hearing this, Mejius and the others all looked sad and fell to their knees on the ground, crying loudly for a while.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos turned around, put away his solemn expression, and said to Tormid: "Let's start implementing the agreement."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Soon, many Theonian doctors who covered their faces with cloth and wore body-wrapped robes entered the Roman team and conducted detailed physical examinations on these soldiers in turn. Any Roman soldiers and people with strange bodies would be fully armed. The Theonian soldiers were brought to live in the newly built camp and were not allowed to go out. The Theonian doctors were responsible for specialized treatment and care.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Other Roman soldiers and people who had no problems for the time being were taken to another newly built camp and were also not allowed to go out. Dr. Theonia would check at any time and if any abnormalities were found, they would be immediately sent to the patient's camp for treatment by the doctors. Treatment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Due to the respect shown by King Davos and others to Camillus before, the Romans reduced a lot of conflicts in the entire inspection and escort process. Of course, this is also related to the fact that they were completely helpless after knowing that the plague was prevalent in the city.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The doctors and soldiers were busy for most of the day, and finally allowed these Romans to move into the camps where they should live.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But their work is not over yet. There are still many wounded Roman soldiers lying in the city gate area. They will be carried to another newly built camp where they will be treated and patiently observed by the medical camp.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Once all this is done, some Theonian soldiers wearing tight protection will enter the city, pour tar everywhere in the city, and completely burn the entire town. This is the fastest way to eliminate the source of the plague.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After reaching an agreement with Aulus, Davos immediately sent people to inform the Volscians in the south, telling them that the city of Satnicum would be burned.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the Volscians heard that there was a plague in Satnicum, their expressions changed immediately, and they were afraid to avoid it, so they dared to oppose it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While the entire city of Satnicum was on fire, Camillus' body was also cremated in front of the Roman generals Aulus and Megius.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Aulus and others felt lost. They stared blankly at the blazing fire, as if Rome was slowly turning into ashes like the body of Camillus. Everyone shed tears for this.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As Davos watched these dejected Roman generals being escorted by soldiers to the camp, he couldn't help frowning and sighing: "This sudden plague will delay us a lot of time!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After all, Davos was not a medical student in his previous life. He did not know how long the incubation period of this infectious disease was. To be on the safe side, he allowed the troops in the camp to stay here for 15 days while supervising the Romans in other camps. To prevent them from escaping, it is also to observe whether there are sick people among the Theonian soldiers so that they can be isolated and treated in time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Tormid advised with concern: "Your Majesty, it is enough for us to be here. You should sit in Rome, stabilize the order of the entire occupied area, and at the same time plan a war against the Carthaginians!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Tormid is right, Your Majesty, the last army of Rome has surrendered. Only Vilitre has nothing to worry about. The war in Latium is finally over. We are enough here. You should return to Rome! "Olivers also quickly advised.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos waved his hand and said firmly: "This matter has been discussed, don't try to persuade me anymore, I will stay with you and the soldiers to get through this difficulty together!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After saying that, he looked at Croto Cartax next to him and asked: "Kloto, what about you?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Clotokatax answered without hesitation: "Father, you once said, 'The people have given the royal family great honor, but it also means that we have to bear great responsibilities.' I will not be a deserter. You have to stay here too!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Well said!" Davos smiled happily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Today's work is over, everyone should go home quickly." Stolo stood next to the Theonian engineer and translated his words in Latin.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Romans who were demolishing the dilapidated houses on both sides of the street immediately put down their tools and cheered.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The engineer once again warned them loudly and cautiously, "You must arrive early tomorrow."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Romans promised loudly and then scattered.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Stolo did not leave immediately. He quietly watched the Theonian citizens who had just arrived in Rome and were working on rebuilding the blocks like the Romans carefully put away all the construction tools. They took the lead. After people asked the engineer about tomorrow's construction schedule, everyone discussed together, determined the time for tomorrow's gathering, and clarified the tasks that everyone was responsible for, and then left together.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When leaving, these Theonian citizens also shouted to him in a friendly manner: "Strow, let's go and play football together!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Stolo smiled and declined.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As these young citizens of Theonia moved to Rome, they also brought rugby to Rome. Stolo saw with his own eyes the rugby matches held by these citizens of Theonia. The rules were complex and interesting, and the scenes were fierce and very confrontational. Attractive, he even thought it was much more interesting than the bloody gladiatorial matches held in Rome.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Why don't you come along?" came a voice from behind.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Storro turned around and saw that it was Meinas, the newly appointed Demo Chief of Laventing City and the general person in charge of the slum reconstruction this time, so he said lightly: "It's getting late, I still have to Rush back for dinner."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's still early autumn, and it won't get dark for a few hours." Maienas exposed his perfunctory words without any politeness at all: "I see you, it's because the knot in your heart hasn't been untied yet, and you haven't taken the initiative to get rid of it. Adapt to this new Rome."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Stolo opened his mouth, but finally remained silent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since both Stolo and Sextus were outstanding figures among the Roman common people, they had frequent contacts and were considered good friends, so Sextus' father Maenas spoke in an elder's tone and spoke with sincerity. He said to him: "You are different from Sextus. You have a deeper connection with the original Roman aristocracy. It is said that your father is still resisting tenaciously in the city of Satnicum, while your father-in-law is still clinging to the Capitol." Lin Shan even refused your offer to surrender. It's really difficult for you to be caught in the middle... But you must make up your mind as soon as possible!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Judging from the current situation, your father and your father-in-law's resistance to Theonia will surely fail! In the future, Rome will only be the Rome of the Kingdom of Theonia. We must all work hard to adapt to this new change, and new changes mean new opportunities! For example, people like me...such as Sextus...will more easily obtain public offices in the kingdom that they have never thought of before.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I can feel that the Theonians value you more. You should also be able to get a good position as your new starting point in this kingdom, and win more rights for yourself and us Roman civilians in the future! But you have to hurry up, opportunities will not always be there waiting for you! Have you seen those young people from Theonia? "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mainas pointed at the Theonian citizens who were leaving in droves, and sighed: "You must have felt when you have been with them these days. These new Theonians have been comprehensively trained." With good education, they are not only physically strong, but also smart. They can also obey orders better and know how to work together. The work they are responsible for is always completed quickly and well... It's scary! As far as I know, their parents have Like us, they were poor people in the Greek city-states, poor, ignorant, and illiterate.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   No wonder Theonia was able to conquer Rome so easily! The only advantage we have now is that we are Romans, and we are more familiar with the Roman people and the surrounding Latium area than they are... However, once they have lived here for a long time and become familiar with everything here, then... ..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mainas did not say anything further. Seeing Stolo's face change slightly, he knew that he had listened, so he patted his shoulder gently and said solemnly: "Think about it carefully, for yourself and for We Romans, don't miss your chance!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Maienas left, his words still echoed in Stolo's mind. He walked slowly on the streets of Raventing, lost in thought.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the past, Stolo would not have dared to be so distracted. The roads in the city of Rome were very bad, especially in the Laventine area. The ground was uneven, garbage was everywhere, and sewage flowed across the road. He had to walk extremely carefully, but the Theonians occupied the city of Rome. After that, the new Roman administrator Asistes ignored the fact that the war was still going on, and soon began to exercise his power and promulgated many measures. One of the most important ones was to transform the Roman city and first remove it from the areas with the worst environmental sanitation. The Laventine area begins.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   With the Theonian soldiers stationed in the city as the main force and Roman civilians as assistants, he began a continuous urban transformation operation. Later, he also let the Theonian citizens who moved to Rome join in. Today, one month later, It can be said that the road reconstruction in the entire Laventine area has been basically completed.
