   Chapter 1137 Jason's Decision
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   By the time Jason arrived at the Leuctra Highlands, the battle had been over for seven days.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The messengers from the Spartan coalition also arrived in Sparta subsequently. The news of the failure of the battle shocked the Spartans. You must know that Sparta has been engaged in constant foreign wars in these years, and the real Spartan warriors have grown from 3,000 at their peak. The number of people has dropped to less than 2,000, relying more on the Piliasians, Helots and allied armies to fight. Now 400 Spartan warriors have died in the battle, including a Spartan king. It was undoubtedly a huge loss for Sparta.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not only were the people grieving, but according to tradition, a grand funeral was held for Cleombrotus. But now the situation was critical, and the Spartan coalition forces trapped in Boiosia were still in urgent need of rescue. The army headed by Agesilaus The Council of Elders and the censors had to implore the people to temporarily suppress their grief, and urgently mobilized the young men in the territory (including the Piliasians and some Helots) to form an army, led by the son of Agesilaus. Archidamus took command (because Agesilaus was unwell and could not lead the army), and nearby allies also provided support.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Persian envoy Datis who stayed in Sparta was also shocked. He did not expect that the large Spartan army would suffer a defeat. This made him doubt whether Persia's support for Sparta was a mistake, but now Bis had already formed an alliance with Theonia, and it was impossible for Persia to change its support to a Greek city-state in a short time, so he rushed to the Council of Elders to question him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Many elders were angry, and Agesilaus reassured him: "This is just an accidental defeat. The Spartan army is still strong and will soon defeat Thebes again and reestablish Greek hegemony." ."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Datis was noncommittal about his answer, but asked them: "Persia is not only willing to provide money and materials to support Sparta, but is also willing to send troops to support it."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Agesilaus quickly expressed his thanks, but declined politely. The request for "Persia to send reinforcements" was made.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sparta was in urgent need of money and materials, because it could be used to hire mercenaries, expand the size of the army, and continue fighting against Thebes.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, since the Greco-Persian War, no Persian army has set foot on Greek soil in decades. If Sparta dared to invite the Persian army, it would undoubtedly arouse the indignation of the Greek city-states and become the target of public criticism. Even its former allies would There will be betrayal.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Archidamus led this army quickly north, then took a ship through Corinth and landed at the port of Chryses.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the speed of the Spartan reinforcements was still a bit slow. While they were still heading north, all Thessalian reinforcements had arrived at Leuctra. The strength of the Boeotian coalition forces had been greatly enhanced and had exceeded The Spartan Allied Forces, so Ipamilonda proposed: "Take advantage of this favorable opportunity to launch a fierce attack on the Spartan Allied Forces' camp and completely eliminate the Spartan Allied Forces in Boeotia!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Jason did not at this time Jason was excited when he first heard the news of the victory, because his most important minister, Archidamas, also rushed to Leuctra. After analyzing the current situation in Greece in private with him, Jason realized To: The failure of the Battle of Leuctra has dealt a big blow to the prestige of the Spartans. It has indeed weakened Sparta's obstacle to Thessaly's dominance of Greece, but it also allowed him to see Thebes. human potential.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If the Thebans completely help the Thebans completely annihilate the Spartan army at this time and severely weaken the strength of the Spartans, the real ones who will benefit the most are undoubtedly the Thebans. They will quickly take over the Spartans' control in the center. Greece's legacy and strength will be rapidly improved, and it will become Thessaly's biggest opponent in dominating Greece.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After thinking about this, Jason did not agree to Ipamilonda's request. Instead, he persuaded: "The Boeotian coalition finally won the battle. There is no need to take further risks. After all, attacking the camp is more difficult than fighting in the wild. More. With Spartan reinforcements arriving at any time, if the attack fails for a long time, it will put the coalition forces into a dangerous situation. It is better to take advantage of the advantage now and force the Spartans to sign an armistice agreement, allowing Both armies can evacuate safely."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It sounds like what Jason said is reasonable, but Ipamilonda and Pelopidas still hope to pursue the victory, so the two sides continue to argue for a while, Ipamilonda Ronda saw that Jason was always resolute and unwilling to fight. Without the help of Thessalian reinforcements, if the Boeotian coalition forces alone wanted to attack the Sparta camp, they would inevitably pay a high price. After weighing the pros and cons, in the end He had no choice but to agree to Jason's suggestion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, Jason acted as a mediator between the two parties and arranged peace talks between the two parties.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reinforcements in the rear did not know when they would arrive, and the Thebans were obviously stronger after receiving reinforcements from Thessaly. Therefore, the demoralized Spartan coalition quickly signed an armistice agreement with the Boeotian coalition.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   That night, the Spartan coalition quietly withdrew.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Being able to successfully mediate the war between Sparta, the former Greek overlord, and Thebes, the emerging power in Central Greece today, Jason showed his face in a big way, and the power of the Thessalians also came to the fore for the first time. The political stage in the core areas of Greece has attracted the attention of many Greek city-states.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The proud Jason led his army back to Thessaly and did something that shocked the southern Greeks.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He led the army to attack Heraclea (not the city of Heraclea in the Holy Kingdom of Theonia), which was west of Thermopylae and not far away. The city-state had been controlled by Sparta before and was defended by Thermopylae. Strong guarantee, after all, the terrain of Hot Spring Pass is narrow and cannot allow too many soldiers to be stationed for a long time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Jason not only attacked it easily, but also completely destroyed it.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In today's war-torn Greece, it is common for a city-state to be captured or even destroyed. But what Jason did was not simple. In the eyes of the Greek people, it was a barbarian from the north who wanted to enter Greece. Discourtesy in one's core area.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Theban commanders Epamilondas and Pelopidas, who had just returned to the city and were welcomed by the crowd, frowned when they heard the news. Jason had been persuading them to carry out the plan with the Spartans. They had felt uneasy during the armistice, and now they were even more certain of Thessaly Taggus's ambitions: The Spartans have not been completely defeated, but will our former allies become our new enemies?
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   !
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even more anxious than the Thebans were the Phokis people, because the Thessalians destroyed Heraclea and occupied Thermopylae. If they led their army south, the Phokis area would be the first to suffer, followed by Pio's turn. Xia region, so the priests of Delphi were very anxious and finally became proactive, preparing to invite various Greek city-states to hold a Holy Alliance Conference to discuss how to deal with the threat of the Thessalians in Northern Greece. It would be best to resolve Sparta and Delphi. The war between Bisi can allow both sides to maintain a longer-term peace.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The premonitions of the Delphi priests were correct; Jason had indeed already conceived a plan to conquer the Phokis region in his mind.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the coming year will be the year when the Pythian Games will be held at Delphi, he has already planned to show his great power in front of the Greek people of other city-states at this games. Therefore, he decided to issue an order after returning to Philae, requiring The Thessalian city-states prepared cattle and sheep for the soon-to-arrive Delphi sacrifice, and promised to award a golden crown to the strongest bull.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, he also asked all city-states to mobilize military forces and form a huge army, which he would lead to Delphi to host the celebration.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Jason has made up his mind to use force to deprive the Holy Alliance Committee of its rights and force himself to become the chairman of the Pythian Games...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the history of his previous life, he made unabashed preparations according to this plan, letting Del The Filipinos were so panicked that rumors spread that "he planned to rob the holy treasury of the Temple of Delphi", which aroused the anger of Apollo's most devout believers.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So one day a few months later, after Jason completed his inspection of the army, he sat down to listen to the petitions of his subjects. Seven young people with red faces in argument came forward, pretending to submit the dispute to him for resolution. .
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As they approached, they suddenly burst out and killed Jason in his seat.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This assassination incident completely changed the course of history. Jason died before his ambition was fulfilled. Thessaly, which was united by his force, quickly split. As a result, the Thebans and later the Macedonians were benefited.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But in this life, Jason's plan had to be temporarily stopped as soon as it started to be implemented, because a major event happened in the Peloponnese Peninsula in the south.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the port of Cleucis originally controlled by Thebes was occupied by the Spartans, Thebes had no port in the Gulf of Corinth, so it was sent to Theonia The messenger had to rush to the bay north of the Boeotian area to take a boat.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a result, if the passenger ship wants to reach Theonia, it must make a large circle and carefully avoid the patrols of the Spartan fleet. Therefore, when the Thebes and Spartan armies reached an armistice agreement, the messenger still Unable to reach Thurii.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But Theonia has been paying close attention to this war for a long time. The spies sent by the intelligence department are hidden in the merchant ships that trade with various Greek city-states. Therefore, as soon as the Battle of Leuctra ended, Dionysus stayed in the port of Corinth. The Asian merchant ship quickly left the port and headed west quickly. The Spartan patrol warships did not dare to stop it. So at the same time that Jason received the news of the battle, the battle report of the battle had been sent to the palace of Thurii.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Therefore, Davos summoned the auxiliary ministers, major department ministers, and important military generals to hold an important meeting in the palace.
