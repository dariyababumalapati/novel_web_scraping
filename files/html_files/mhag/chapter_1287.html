   Chapter 1287 Return to Byzantium

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, Melisander asked: "I see on this map that the distance from Egypt to Cyprus seems to be farther than the distance from Crete to Cyrenaica. Such a long sea The distance is so long, and there is no way to stop to rest or replenish food and water on the way, can the troop transport fleet really arrive smoothly? After our fleet reaches the waters near Cyprus, will it still have the ability to fight?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Chalcedis replied seriously: "I I have carefully asked the Greek merchants in Naukratis who often go to Cyprus to trade, and they all told me that there will not be any storms in the Near East waters during this season. As long as you have enough food and water on the boat, you can sail day and night. It only takes three or four days to reach Cyprus (one of the important reasons why ship sailing is faster than land march is that it can sail 24 hours a day as long as it knows the route and uses sails), and we can hire these Nauklati The Sicilian merchants served as guides to lead the way for us.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As for the navy... I still remember that they once made a long-distance attack on Carthage from Sicily and finally defeated the Carthage fleet. They should be very experienced in this area. Of course, they still need to make their own judgments. ."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "How is the defense on Cyprus Island? How many troops are there?" Matonis was a little moved, and his tone became urgent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "A few decades ago, Cyprus was just a dependency of Persia. The king of Cyprus once united with the Greek city-states in Asia Minor several times to gain independence, but Persia finally suppressed it. Since then, the Persians have learned their lesson and abolished The king of Cyprus split Cyprus into multiple city-states and did not allow them to build tall and thick city walls, otherwise it would be disloyal to Persia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although I don't know how many troops Cyprus can muster to fight us, it is obvious that they The defense capability is not strong, and their largest city-state, Nicosia, is located in the center of the plain and is easy to capture... Moreover, just now everyone felt that it would be difficult to attack Cyprus from the sea. We all have this idea, and the Cypriots will not Thinking of this, our raid will definitely be successful!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Chalcedis finished speaking, the eyes of the legion commanders all lit up.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos coughed slightly, attracted the attention of the generals, and then said thoughtfully: "It is indeed a good idea to attack Cyprus from the sea, but this is more to gain dominance at sea, not to attack the Persian Near East. After all, except for the Gulf of Issus, other areas do not have the conditions for large-scale landings...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   According to intelligence, the Persians have assembled a large number of troops in the Mesopotamia. Once we capture Cyprus, we will inevitably It will arouse the vigilance of the Persians, who will definitely strengthen the defense of the Issus coast. If our main force wants to carry out landing operations in the Near East, it will undoubtedly take great risks, so the focus of our attack must still be on land. As

 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   as we occupy Cyprus and destroy the Persian fleet, the transport fleet can safely sail along the coast and supply troops marching on land at any time. Even with maritime transportation support, our army can completely Instead of attacking Gaza, advance directly to the north -"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Davos looked down at the small and narrow seaside area north of Gaza City on the map, with a somewhat complicated expression: "Chalsidis, do you know anything about Jerusalem in Canaan? "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Your Majesty, I have asked people that the Jews living in Jerusalem are a weak nation. They were massacred by the Assyrians and imprisoned the survivors in Babylon. Although the Persians later released them and allowed They returned to their hometown, but decades later, their numbers were still small...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I heard that a few years ago they sent people to plead with the King of Persia, hoping to allocate some money to rebuild their dilapidated temple. The King of Persia agreed. At their request, they even appointed their trusted cupbearer, Nehemiah, who was also a Jew, as governor of Jerusalem to take charge of this matter. As a

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   result, after Nehemiah arrived in Jerusalem, he had an affair with Sanballat, the governor of Samaria to the east. Contradictions, and conflicts continue to this day... Therefore, the weak Jews are unable to stop our army, and we can even occupy this place -" Chalsidis pointed to an icon on the map: "Jaffa, a port town in the Jerusalem area , for our fleet to berth..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Very good!" Davos looked away from the map, looked around everyone, and said solemnly: "Everyone, I think everyone agrees with the suggestion put forward by Chalcedis. , so next I will summon Seclian, Midorades and Stephakas as soon as possible to hold another military meeting to discuss the feasibility of attacking Cyprus and annihilating the main force of the Persian fleet...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   regardless of the result of the next military meeting No matter what, the attack on Persia will be launched in a short period of time. I just hope that you will use this time to let the soldiers of each legion learn and adapt to marching, camping and fighting in the desert as soon as possible!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Yes, Your Majesty!" Everyone said in unison respond.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The next day Davos took Asistes and the high priest Amenhotep to Ptah. He worshiped at the temple of Osiris and was warmly welcomed by the temple priests. He also had close contact with Apis, the sacred cow raised in the temple.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The fat cow, which was all black with only a white star spot on its forehead, was very friendly to him. It flicked its tail and quickly finished the fodder he handed over, making the priests of Ptah and Orisis shout loudly. Praise (Apis was first considered to be the incarnation of Ptah, the creation god, and later evolved into the incarnation of Osiris): "Pharaoh Davos is worthy of being the son of Amon, and even the comfortable sacred cow dare not slack off. !"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then Davos went to the temple of Knight, the goddess of wisdom and war, to worship. He even promised Amenhotep that he would take time to worship at the Karak Temple in Thebes, but he refused. Another piece of advice from the Egyptian high priest: Go to the Temple of Amun in the Siwa Oasis to get an oracle.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Siwa Oasis is located in the desert of western Egypt. The Temple of Amun there is quite ancient and highly respected. Its oracle is famous far and wide. Not only the Egyptians often go to worship, but also the Greeks have many admirers, especially It was in Thessaly and Macedonia in northern Greece.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reason why Davos refused was not because it was very difficult to go to the Siwa Oasis. Although he remembered that Alexander in his previous life went to the Siwa Oasis Temple to worship after conquering Egypt, and encountered many obstacles on the way. It is dangerous, but Amenhotep repeatedly stated: Although Siwa Oasis is located in the desert, its route is very safe because people often go there to worship.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The problem that Davos considered was that many Greeks who went to worship in the Siwa Oasis regarded Amon in that temple as the incarnation of Zeus in Egypt. Historically, Alexander claimed that he was the child of Zeus, so of course he had to go to worship. Yes, but as a descendant of Hades, Davos is obviously not suitable.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time that King Davos arrived in Egypt, the central Italian coalition forces headed by Volsi, Herniki, and Sabine also landed in Asia Minor by ship. By now, all the Greek coalition forces commanded by Leoticides had Gather together.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   During the period when the Greek coalition forces arrived one after another, he did not wait quietly, but was always in an active offensive posture. Not only did he successively force the surrender of towns near the Hellespont, but he also took advantage of the victory in the Battle of Samos Under the influence of the emperor, he led the main force away from the coastline and penetrated deep into the interior of Mysia. At the same time, he also sent some troops southward and entered Lydia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because the Persian army was unable to resist, the Greek coalition forces became powerful for a while. Not only the Greek city-states along the coast, such as Bosworth and Chios, surrendered, but even some towns in the interior of Mysia and Lydia also surrendered to it. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   An interesting thing happened during this period. The commander of the Tenth Legion, Stepros, made a request to Leoticides: He hoped that he could lead a force to the other side of the strait and force Byzantium to surrender.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thirty years ago, the Persian mercenaries, the predecessor of the Theonian army, were humiliated in Byzantium, including King Davos. Leoticides had heard about this, and he knew in his heart: This The request may not be Stepforos's own will, but may come from his father Amyntas, or even the collective instruction of many veterans in the army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course Leoticides would not refuse, and even since there was not much military pressure at the moment, he generously approved: Styphros could lead the entire Tenth Legion there.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Stepforos led his army to land on the beach near Byzantium. As soon as he set up camp, the Byzantine envoy arrived and humbly expressed to him: Byzantium is willing to serve as the master of the Holy Kingdom of Theonia!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The incident that happened decades ago has long been forgotten by Byzantium, which has almost changed a generation. However, the Byzantines know that Athens, Sparta, and even the entire mainland of Greece, which they once attached to, are crawling. At the feet of Theonia, Theonia's power had not spread to the Youke Star Sea before, and the Byzantines could still pretend not to know. Now that the opponent's army is close at hand, they who have always known how to adapt to the wind immediately surrendered. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, Stepforos would not take the initiative to repeat the embarrassing events of the year, but put forward some harsh requirements, such as providing a large amount of food, tribute, and providing fleets and labor to provide assistance to the army... All of Byzantium accept.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Byzantines were so aware that Stepforos could not make unreasonable troubles, so he had to lead 8,000 fully armed soldiers in an armed parade in the Byzantine city. Finally, he asked the Byzantine government to build a monumental column in the port, and the top of it must be inlaid with Diver. A statue of the king of Sri Lanka riding a horse and wielding a sword.
