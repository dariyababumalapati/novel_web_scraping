   "There is no other way. Only by uniting the entire western Asia Minor can we have enough strength to fight against that king!" Ariobazenis said in a deep voice: "Stridatus is a A cautious person, since he dares to take the initiative, it means that he is very sure to convince several other governors and can keep the secret."

 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Theonia After the army occupied the territory of Sparta, the remaining Greek city-states led by Athens were actively organizing a coalition to prepare to confront it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, the Theonian Ministry of Military Affairs conveyed the order of King Davos to Leotychides, asking him to gather the Eighth Army and the Fifteenth Army at Lilybeg (the military camp is in Syracuse, The troops come from the Syracuse area), the Sixteenth Army (the military camp is in Agrigento, the soldiers come from the south coast of Sicily), and the Seventeenth Army (the military camp is in Lilibi, the soldiers come from the western region of Sicily). The Legion, the Fourth Cavalry Legion, and the Numibian Light Cavalry Legion waited until the transport fleet arrived and immediately headed for Egypt.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, another order from the Ministry of Military Affairs was sent to Midorades, asking him to lead the 2nd Fleet to prepare to escort the army on the expedition to Egypt.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, King Davos also issued an order to the Phoenician allies headed by Carthage along the African coast, asking them to immediately form a large number of transport fleets to transport the Theonian army gathered in Lilybi to Egypt. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, the Ministry of Military Affairs transferred Patroclus, the former commander of the Fourteenth Legion and current commander of the northern border, who was still quelling the Liguria riots, back to Torii, and Hasdrubal replaced him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the same time, the Ministry of Military Affairs also issued orders to military camps in various regions: Except for the expedition to the Peloponnese and the legions about to go to Egypt, all the remaining troops in the kingdom began to assemble.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, it was also specifically proposed that the Po River area must provide 6,000 warriors and 2,000 Gallic cavalry.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition, the Ministry of Military Affairs also transferred the 3rd Fleet, which is responsible for the security of the kingdom's west coast, to Brindisi to make preliminary preparations.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the issuance of these orders means that major military operations will take place, what each military camp announced to the outside world is to conduct joint training of the entire army. Since such military training occurs at least once every two months, people everywhere are worried. I didn't feel anything strange.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the main officials of various departments in the Kingdom of Theonia in Thurii have begun to be busy preparing for the next war.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is still a peaceful scene in Theonia on the surface, but there are already clouds of war in mainland Greece.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In June, Jason of Thessaly led nearly 40,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry across Thermopylae and entered Central Greece.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although he declared in a high-profile manner that "this time he led the army to help the Greeks in the south and repel the invading aliens." However, the people of Central Greece still felt nervous, and people from various city-states hid in the city, closed the city gates, and stepped up vigilance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Jason kept his word, and he tried his best to restrain the troops. Although there were still some incidents of soldiers looting property from villages outside the city, overall the military discipline of his troops was pretty good, which made the top officials of the city-states heave a big sigh of relief. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After entering the Boeotian region, Jason sent an envoy into the city of Thebes and made a request to the council: The Thessalian army wanted to establish a longer-term camp in Thebes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Theban senior officials, headed by Pelopidas and Ipamilonda, argued tactfully: Thessaly and Theonia are both allies of Thebes and have provided huge help to Thebes. Precisely because In this way, Thebes has to remain neutral to avoid hurting the friendship of a certain party. If it agrees to Thessaly's request, it may cause Theonia to misunderstand and mistakenly think that Thebes has joined the anti-Theonia. Asian League, so they had to say no.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Jason made this request just to test the attitude of the Thebans, so when he received a rejection, he did not feel angry. Instead, he patiently asked the returning messenger about the attitude and attitude of everyone in the Theban Council at that time. The reaction gave me peace of mind.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A few days later, the Thessalian army arrived at the northwest border of Attica in Athens and built a camp near Orops, a Boeotian city-state that had a close relationship with Athens. This was discussed with Athens in advance, because Oropus The port of Sri Lanka is not small, and the sea distance from Philae is very close, making it convenient for transporting supplies and soldiers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The top leaders of Athens, headed by Callistratus, warmly welcomed the arrival of the Thessalian army led by Jason, and one day later a military meeting of the Greek Alliance was held in Megara on the Isthmus of Corinth to join the city-states of the alliance. The generals expressed their opinions one after another.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Many Central Greek city-state generals suggested that they should use the geographical advantages of the isthmus to accumulate heavy troops in the city of Corinth to defend against the attack of the Theonian army, just like during the Corinth War more than ten years ago.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Theonians' cross-sea attack consumes a lot of materials, which is not conducive to long-term operations. If they cannot win for a long time, they will inevitably choose to cease the war and seek peace in the end.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The generals of the Peloponnesian city-states headed by Argos and Corinth expressed opposition. They believed that the Theonian army had now conquered Messenia and Sparta, and Arcadia had also become its ally. , which makes the Theonians very powerful in the Peloponnese. If the coalition does not take the initiative to attack, but passively defends, the Theonians will definitely turn to attack other parts of the Peloponnese. area.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Once it completely conquers the entire Peloponnese, it will not only weaken the power of the Greek Alliance, but also the Theonian army without worries can attack Corinth with all its strength. It will be difficult to say whether Corinth can be defended in the end.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now the number of the coalition forces has reached 80,000, which far exceeds the number of soldiers in the Theonian army. They can take the initiative to defeat the Theonian army in Sparta.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After both sides expressed their opinions, Jason spoke: "Everyone, the purpose of the Greek Alliance was to repel the invading Theonia and ensure the freedom of the Greek city-states and the security of the territory. If it was only for defense in Corinth, That would be equivalent to giving up the entire Peloponnese Peninsula. This not only goes against the original intention of establishing the alliance, but will also make the city-states joining the alliance complain to each other and undermine unity. Therefore, I suggest that we should not waste any more time and lead the coalition army immediately. Enter the Peloponnese, quickly fight the Theonian army, defeat it, and let the Spartans regain their freedom!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Jason put his hands on his hips, looked at the generals in the venue, and declared loudly: "If everyone If you don't agree with my opinion, or keep arguing and wasting time, then I will lead the Thessalian army and go south alone to fight a decisive battle with the Theonian army!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Jason's words were like a stone thrown into a deep pool. While causing waves, they also received positive responses from the generals of Corinth and Argos: "I, the citizens of Corinth (Argos), will follow the Thessalian army to attack the Theonians!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Thessaly's army accounted for half of the soldiers sent out in the entire alliance, Thessaly, which had been on the edge of traditional Greek power for decades, did not attract much attention from the Greek city-states. Therefore, Jason did not have much influence in this alliance. Although he had much prestige, the support of these two powerful countries made Jason famous.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although so far, the number of soldiers sent by Athens to Corinth is only half of the Thessalian army, but with Sparta already declining, most Greek city-states are more willing to follow Athens' lead, so other city-state generals have set their sights. Another person - the famous Athenian general Iphicrates.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The battle-hardened veteran glanced at Jason, then looked around at everyone, and said in a calm tone: "I agree that the coalition should seize the time to take the initiative and seek a decisive battle with the Theonian army, but at the same time, we We also need to do two things.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The first is that we immediately send envoys to the Arcadia Alliance to persuade them to join us and fight against Theonia. Now that the coalition has the upper hand, Arcadia There is a high possibility that the alliance will fall to us. After all, Theonia is an outsider. If it succeeds, it will enhance the strength of the alliance and at the same time provide greater convenience for us to fight in the Peloponnese. If we are attacked If we refuse, we can also confidently launch an attack on the Arcadian Alliance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The second reason is that Theonia was able to defeat Sparta because it had a powerful navy and was able to use fleets to carry The landing of the army in Messenia and the rapid occupation of Messenian territory has a lot to do with it, so we must also be careful of Theonia's old tricks repeating themselves. While our army is fighting in the Peloponnese, we land by sea. It will be a huge disaster to defend the relatively empty rear, cut off our return route, and threaten our motherland! Therefore, I suggest that part of the army must be left to garrison various beaches in Central Greece that can be landed, especially Piedmont. The port of Chrysis in the Osha region must be firmly controlled by the coalition forces!" "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But Chrysis now belongs to the Thebans!" someone reminded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "When most of our Greek city-states have gathered together to resist the invading outsiders, Thebes, as a powerful country in Central Greece, has chosen to be neutral. This is really not what it should be! It's just that a war is imminent and in order to avoid unnecessary trouble , we have temporarily tolerated the willfulness of the Thebans." Iphicrates said sternly with a serious expression: "But the inaction of the Thebans will inevitably cause us to distrust them! Therefore, we should send The envoys went to Thebes and told them clearly that we would temporarily take over Chrysis and return them to them after the war. If Thebes does not agree, then we will regard them as enemies and attack them!" (
