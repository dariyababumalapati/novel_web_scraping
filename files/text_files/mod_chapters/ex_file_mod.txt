Chapter 186 Dilemma On

  June 12, 1852, the British Parliament passed the Army Expansion Act.

  The 120,000 troop expansion proposed by Maximi was 
still discounted, and shrewd members of Congress limited the final troop expansion to 80,000. The reason is naturally that armaments should be carried out according to actual needs and taxpayers' money cannot be wasted.

  This frugal sense of ownership directly led to the British Army dragging its allies back in the Near East War.

  Compared to the slow-moving British, the French are much more efficient. After confirming the increase in troops, Napoleon III started to explode troops, and the total strength of the French army jumped to 620,000.

  It's as if France, the invincible France 
that once dominated Europe, is back. Apart from the woolly bears, they have the largest standing army in Europe.
