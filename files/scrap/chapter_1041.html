   Chapter 1041 Serving the Elderly
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reality is stark. Whether the French are willing to accept it or not, what is supposed to happen still happens. Now that the war has begun, it is no longer within the control of the French government.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In this world where the jungle prevails, countries speaking with their fists are far more reliable than any big principles.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If the Russians can be defeated on the battlefield, then the matter still has room for negotiation; if it is defeated again, then from now on, France can rest assured that it will be a third-rate small country without military power!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For the future of the country and the nation, the French now have no choice but to fight to the death. The only way to regain everyone's respect is to fight back from the battlefield with a sword and a gun.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The French government has no retreat, so why not the Tsarist government?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Russian Empire's great fame and awe in the world depended on its iron head. If they retreat when they encounter some difficulties, why should they make European countries afraid?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This Franco-Russian War was caused by the Russians themselves. If it could not even manage a France that was defeated and in decline after the war, the Tsarist government would be disgraced.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If you lose face, you will lose it, and your external deterrent effect must not be weakened. Looking through the history books of the Russian Empire is a history of war and expansion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the process of continuous expansion, the Russians also offended their surrounding neighbors. It is true that no one dares to mess with the powerful Russian Empire, but it will be different once it falls into decline.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The First Russo-Prussian War is the best example. As soon as the Russian Empire showed its weakness, its neighbors from all directions pounced on it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Had it not been for the Vienna government to step in and give them a hand at the critical moment, there would be no Russian Empire today.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The lessons of history are there, and it is impossible for the tsarist government not to learn from them. What's more, today is different from the past. The current Shinra Empire no longer needs to stick together with Russia for warmth.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If they do it again, the possibility of adding insult to injury to Vienna is far greater than the possibility of pulling them ashore.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Both sides had reasons for victory. The bloodiest scene occurred just after the Franco-Russian War broke out.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to clear the place and avoid being attacked by endless guerrillas, the Russian army stationed in Paris resisted international pressure and resorted to the simplest and most effective method of serial warfare.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Whenever there is a guerrilla attack, and the residents of the surrounding villages and towns within five kilometers do not report it, they will all follow the attack. Even in a big city like Paris, if it is attacked by guerrillas, the residents of the entire street must be held accountable.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There was no direct massacre, but the punishment method adopted by the Russian army was not much different from massacre.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Being exiled to Siberia to dig potatoes seems to have left a small gap. In fact, there is only a conceptual gap in time between being sent directly to see God.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone knows the integrity of the tsarist government's bureaucrats. They often mistreat their own people, let alone their enemies.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is necessary to have insufficient supplies. The old, weak, sick and disabled are shipped together without any medical aid. If they have a fever or cough, they will be thrown into the sea to feed the fish.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The number of exiled Frenchmen was often reduced by one-third by the time they reached the Russian Empire. There are actually very few people who can walk to Siberia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even if you are lucky enough to get there, you may not be able to save your life. The tsarist government often forgets to distribute necessary supplies.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The exiles with thin clothing and bare hands must survive the double test of nature and belly if they want to survive in the ice and snow of Siberia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   To borrow a comment from Leo Tolstoy: The greatest significance of the Tsarist government’s exile policy is to add “fertilizer” to the land of the Russian Empire.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Fortunately it is winter now, and the temperature in the Russian Empire is low enough. Otherwise, if the Tsarist government had been so troubled, the plague would have been infested long ago.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   That is to say, the viruses these days have not evolved. If they had experienced the power of COVID-19 and SARS, the custodial tsarist government would not dare to play this way.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, with the current medical capabilities and the vast and sparsely populated Russian Empire, it is estimated that if an epidemic virus breaks out, no one will detect it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What is the mortality rate of infected people? What is the difference between that and a cold? It's surprising that the common cold can be so lethal that it attracts attention.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What is really shocking is the kind of highly lethal virus that directly disappears a village or a small town, such as the plague.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It goes without saying that another addition to the hatred between France and Russia was added. After seeing the excitement of the melon-eating crowd, they also turned into talkative party, and stood on the commanding heights of morality to point out the country.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Unwilling to be left alone, literati and writers did not hesitate to write and write, and one open letter after another appeared in newspapers. Regardless of whether the top leaders of the French and Russian governments can see it, it will not affect everyone's enthusiasm for creation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The news media did not forget to add fuel to the flames, criticizing the Russians for being brutal one day and criticizing the French for being unruly the next.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In short, both France and Russia have become villains and are despised by everyone. It can be seen that political correctness is still important in continental Europe.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The public opinion expected by the French government did not appear to be one-sided. In terms of public opinion among the members of the Anti-French Alliance, they even fell into a disadvantage.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   No matter how excessive the Russian army went, they could not withstand the whitewashing of Spring and Autumn's brushwork. Taking the Holy Roman Empire as an example, newspapers subconsciously ignored the tragic experiences of the French people in exile.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   News needs to be notarized, but journalists have a position. France is the enemy, and the Russians are allies. It is obvious who we prefer.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The conscience of journalists makes them reluctant to distort the facts, but selective reporting is still possible.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   History can be said to be surprisingly similar. A similar scene also occurred in the original time and space, but the time and the victims have changed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a rule of political correctness, any crime can be covered up. Identity determines stance. The current tragic experience of the French people is actually still paying for previous acts of aggression.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After an avalanche, no snowflake is innocent. Likewise, no snowflake can escape the punishment brought by the laws of nature.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the blink of an eye, 1895 came to an end. The war raged from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, from the Philippines to the Far East, then to Cuba, then to Morocco, and finally to France.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Wars broke out on four continents at the same time, which is rare in human history. The wide scope and large population involved are no less than those of the previous European wars.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It’s Christmas again, the outside world is raging with war, but Vienna is still as prosperous as ever. The celebration banquet ended in a hurry, and Franz came to the highest point of the palace alone, looking into the distance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As people get older, they are most likely to be sentimental. Both lives combined were over 90 years old, and Franz had to admit that he was getting old.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even if it is well maintained, time is not forgiving. In his sixties, Franz could no longer find the high-spiritedness of his youth.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Perhaps it’s time to retire.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Franz thought to himself.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is not enough to accept old age. This is not the age of myth. Looking at the entire world, the only trace of transcendence is that of myself, an unscientific time traveler.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even if you want to imitate the ancient empire and pursue the unrealistic dream of immortality, there is no goal to find!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Once people are "tired" or "tired", they want to rest, and Franz is no exception.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In recent years, he has been strengthening the training of his sons in preparation for this day.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It’s just that Franz can’t retreat now. The territory of the Holy Roman Empire is too large, and there are also many problems accompanying it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Some problems can be left to future generations, but there are also some problems that must be dealt with by a strong emperor like him. Otherwise, it will become a chronic disease in future generations.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But before that, the last stumbling block in front of the Holy Roman Empire still had to be kicked away.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Franz would not dare to make major internal changes easily before stabilizing the world situation and removing unstable factors. Always having a sense of awe is also an important factor in his ability to reach this point.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Having made up his mind, Franz felt a lot more relaxed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
