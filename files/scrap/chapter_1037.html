   Chapter 1037 Mess
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Money is hard to come by, and it’s hard to find a middleman. If you want this middleman, you must first have three basic elements: first, you must have a good relationship with the Russians; second, you must have certain financial resources; third, you must not be influenced by Russia and Austria.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Without a good relationship, the deception work will not be carried out easily. Only if the relationship is good enough can the rest of the story be continued.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is no love or hate for no reason in this world. Even if a pie does fall from the sky, before eating it in your stomach, you must first verify whether it is poisonous.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This requires a good story, one that makes the tsarist government think that the middleman helped build the Siberian Railway for its own benefit.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Having a story alone is certainly not enough, you must also have a certain amount of capital. This capital does not need to be much, just to advance part of the cost of the Siberian Railway.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Or we can follow the example of the Vienna government in assisting the construction of the Central Asian Railway, find a railway company to undertake the construction of the Siberian Railway, and allow the Russians to default on exploration, design, management and mechanical equipment leasing fees.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is no shortage of artificial fur bears, and the raw materials can solve most of them. Except for the steel rails, which may need to be imported, the Russians can provide everything else themselves.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, the most expensive parts of railway construction are labor and raw materials. After solving these two big problems, the cost has been reduced by 70 to 80%.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There are no taxes or fees. If someone builds this strategic-level railway, the tsarist government must have given the green light all the way, and even the bureaucrats would not dare to touch it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Perhaps corruption still exists, but it is still relatively clean. If the Russian bureaucracy had performed at its normal level, it would have been impossible to complete the project unless this number had been increased three to five times.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is no way, the conditions in Siberia are too harsh and construction is really difficult. With limited technical conditions, construction costs simply cannot be low.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   So financial resources are also indispensable. The so-called "not much" is only for wealthy people like the UK.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, there are very few countries in the world that can raise tens of millions of pounds, even in installments.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Britain is behind the money, having financial resources is also an essential condition.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If a poor country suddenly takes out such a huge sum of money, it will definitely arouse the suspicion of the Russians.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If the Tsarist government knew that the funds came from the London government, most of the plan would have been ruined before it even started.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition to the first two, the most important thing is to be bold. Any country that dares to participate in the dispute between Shinra and Britain these days is definitely a bold one.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is no need to count on the European continent. Denmark is the only country with good relations with the tsarist government. The problem is that Sweden is in charge of the Nordic Federation, but Sweden and the Russians are feuding.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition to poor relations, the more important thing is that it is not within the sphere of influence of Russia and Austria and can ensure its own safety.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is no way. The Nordic Federation is under the eyes of Russia and Austria. Once the plan is exposed, you can imagine the fate that awaits them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The ultra-high risk inherently determines that countries participating in this plan must have certain self-protection capabilities. Even if the plan is exposed, it will not bring disaster to himself.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If you cannot guarantee your own safety, no matter how great the benefits Britain promises, it is impossible for others to participate.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When you open the map, you will see that there are only two countries left that are not within the sphere of influence of Russia and Austria, have certain financial and military strength, and are not afraid of retaliation afterwards.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Taking into account good diplomatic relations with the Russians, only the United States of America meets the conditions.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As for the other candidate, because the Czar supported the North during the Civil War, the relationship between the independent Allies and the Russians was naturally not much better.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The United States has met all the innate conditions, but the acquired conditions are still lacking. The biggest problem is that it is not bold enough.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Americans in the original time and space are intimidated these days. They are obviously trying to get Cuba's attention, but they are too frightened by Spain's strength to dare to act rashly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   They are just making small moves secretly to test the Spaniards' reaction. Of course, the Spanish government has lived up to expectations and exposed its own weakness.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the end, the U.S. government lingered until 1898 before "taking the risk" of planning the Spanish-American War. It was after defeating Spain that the Americans gradually lost their fear of European powers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not to mention now, Americans who have been severely beaten by society must be even more cowardly!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even the declining Spain did not dare to move. It was too embarrassing for them to plot against the Russian-Austrian alliance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   While the British were still worrying about how to persuade the United States, the Sino-Japanese War of 1884-1894 also came to an end. The Japanese government, which was in its prime moment, never dreamed that they were about to be betrayed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, it’s not considered betrayed. It is a chess piece in the first place. Before it jumps out of the chessboard, it is naturally subject to the remote control of the chess player.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is not easy to take advantage of the great powers. Britain has paid so much for the Japanese and always needs to be rewarded.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Japanese government, lost in the joy of victory and unable to extricate itself, naturally did not expect so much.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It won’t take that long, and soon the Japanese government will no longer be able to laugh. The international community's intervention has already begun, and they want to eat... (Imagine it)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   One wave has not subsided, but another wave has arisen.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Cuba is still fighting fiercely, the Philippines is still digging into ravines, the war in the Far East is still going on, and Europe is in chaos again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone has taken care of the continental economic revitalization strategy, except France.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Spain recruited a group of French mercenaries, which alleviated the crisis in France to a certain extent, this was still a drop in the bucket for a country.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Theory is always just a theory, reality is cruel. Franz's vision of "a mercenary feeding a family" now seems more like a beautiful fairy tale.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not everyone has a strong sense of responsibility. In addition to the initial settlement fee left behind, most mercenaries did not send money home immediately after they left their homeland.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Have to admit that they have strong adaptability and quickly adapted to the life of mercenaries. After receiving their salary, everyone lived a life of "drinking now and getting drunk the next."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Less than half of the people are willing to send money home, and most of those who are willing to send money only send a small part of their income. Those who can account for 1/3 of their income can be called "family men."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In this context, Franz’s plan for mercenaries to make money to support his family, which Franz had high hopes for, naturally ended in bankruptcy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   People always have to eat, and the French economy had already collapsed during the war. The European economic crisis has come to an end, but the economic crisis in France is still far away.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The trauma caused by the war is too great, and the refugees expelled by various countries have made the country even more miserable.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the French government has worked hard to resettle refugees and develop the economy and create jobs as much as possible, there are huge war compensation burdens on their shoulders, and the resources they can use are really limited.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The fact that the Vienna government did not collect reparations does not mean that other countries did not send people to collect reparations. At least the Russian army stationed outside Paris completed the task of collecting reparations as soon as possible.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   That’s right, the Paris government couldn’t afford the compensation, so the Russians took it upon themselves to provide enough food and clothing. The Russian army has been dispatched, and the collection of war reparations must go smoothly!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is no standard at all. Taxation is purely based on personal preferences. It is necessary to charge three to five dou more. All the Russian officers and soldiers who participated in the tax collection activities made a lot of money.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It's just that they have been tortured like this, which has made the French people suffer. Unable to bear the humiliation, King Carlos led the government to go on strike in protest.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The angry French people have taken up arms to resist the atrocities of the Russian army, including some government troops who also participated in the attack on the Russian army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just as Franz took a nap, France became a mess again. Looking at the mess in front of him, Franz suddenly regretted leaving the Russian troops stationed in Paris.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Yes, the Russian army is indeed a good hand in suppressing the revolutionary army. The problem is that their ability to cause trouble is even better.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is no problem in getting war reparations from France, but you have to leave a sigh of relief for others!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Sending troops out to collect taxes, Franz was very suspicious of what kind of commander could issue such a stupid order.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But anyone with a little bit of self-awareness will know what the Russian army is. Normally being stationed in a military camp would make the place miserable.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is better to say that it is released to rob than to be released to collect taxes. It's okay to play like this during the war. Now that the war is over long ago, it would be strange if the French don't break out if they still play like this.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It's a hassle, and as long as he gets into trouble, he can clean up the mess himself, and Franz doesn't have a problem with it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Obviously, things have come to him as the emperor, and the Allied forces stationed in France must be unable to withstand them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Otherwise, who would be able to hold on after being full and cause trouble for his own leader? You must know that this kind of ignorant behavior can greatly affect your "official career".
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It has always been easier to create problems than to solve them. As the leader of the Allied Forces, Butt decides the stance, and it is self-evident which side to stand on.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Years of being an emperor taught Franz that he should not just look at the surface when encountering things, but also analyze things deeply.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   From a clear perspective, the disaster was caused by the Russians, and the Russian troops stationed in Paris were naturally responsible. However, do the French have no responsibility?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now that you know about the complaint, why did you go there earlier?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If the Carlos government had lodged a protest with the Allied Forces Headquarters as soon as the problem occurred, someone might have interfered with the Russian army's actions.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even if you didn’t think of it at the time, when a problem breaks out, you can always report the situation to the Allied headquarters immediately, right?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There were so many opportunities to prevent the Russian army from imposing taxes, but the French government completely missed them all. When things got serious, the government went on strike in protest.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Such an obvious behavior is clearly a deliberate act of indulgence. They are just waiting for things to get serious so that they can take advantage of the sympathy of caring people within the alliance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Franz admitted that the French plan was successful and caused such a big mess. The Allies really needed to give the French an explanation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It's just that it's not sure whether this explanation is what they want. After understanding the goals of the French, Franz's fear of the Carlos government increased to a higher level.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In this context, to deal with the current mess in France, we must carefully consider it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
