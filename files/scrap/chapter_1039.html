   Chapter 1039 It’s not too big a deal to watch the fun, let’s add more fire
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The decision of the tsarist government undoubtedly poured another barrel of oil on France, which was already full of sparks, making the situation even more uncontrollable.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Fortunately, after the victory of the anti-French war, the Allied forces collected the French weapons, otherwise they would not just attack lone Russian soldiers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing the conflict escalating in an all-round way, King Carlos, who was at the center of the storm, decisively fled the powder keg of Paris on the pretext of seeking international assistance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The king was forced to run away to avoid the turmoil, and the French government, which had already gone on strike in protest, naturally closed down.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Similar scenes also happened after World War I in the original time and space. It's just that the Germans have a stronger foundation, and the war was not fought on home soil, so the losses were not as great as the French.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At that time, the German government called on workers to go on strike to prevent the French from taking away its coal resources; at the same time, it printed money to subsidize unemployed workers so that their livelihoods could be maintained.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Great Mark Inflation that shocked the world broke out when the government started printing money by printing, printing, printing... in order to subsidize unemployed workers.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After a set of seven wounds, the Weimar Republic not only crippled itself, but also dragged down the British and French economies.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Especially the French, they did not get the resources they wanted, but were sprayed with blood internationally.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The army has been losing money and cannot see any gains. For France, which suffered heavy losses in the world war, the pressure is really high. In the end, there was really no other way and I was forced to make concessions.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The French have proved with facts that the bottom line is meant to be broken. In the game with the Germans, the French government made concessions again and again, and finally gave up a Third Reich.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although France's current situation is similar to that of Germany in the original time and space, the opponents it faces are completely different.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Anti-French Alliance does not need France's resources. It uses cutting off resources and the supply of industrial and commercial products as a bargaining chip. It is estimated that the Vienna government will not frown even until the next century when the strike occurs.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Especially the Anti-French Alliance in France is a joint garrison of various countries. Except for the Russians who have a larger number of garrison troops, the number of garrison troops of other countries is not large.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The small number of troops means that the military expenditure is not large. Even if the French government shuts down and suspends military expenditures, it will not scare anyone for a while.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, these are not the reasons why King Carlos ran away. In the final analysis, the previous revolutionary government had too much fun, and the French people have long entered the era of billionaires per capita.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is obviously impossible to rely on printing money to relieve unemployed people. Unable to restore the economy and unable to provide relief to refugees, why not run away and stay?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the surface, it was a government strike to protest against the atrocities of the Russian army, but the deeper internal reason was the collapse of government finances.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even though King Carlos has made a lot of money by fighting corruption, this precious money needs to be used wisely and cannot be wasted while stabilizing the situation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Originally, these things have little to do with Franz. He is just a member of the public and is responsible for watching the fun.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Unexpectedly, the brothers who suffered unreasonable disasters refused to agree and asked the Russians for an explanation. Everyone was a little timid.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After all, it is a furry bear, and most people cannot afford to offend it. Even though the territories are no longer contiguous, everyone is still wary of them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But leaving it alone is not an option. The French government has gone on strike and has to bear the cost of garrisoning the troops themselves. We can hold on for a short time, but it won't work if it drags on for a long time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Originally, everyone wanted to give the tsarist government some face and wait for them to clean up the mess. But after seeing the measures taken by the tsarist government, everyone already understood: this is not to solve the problem.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before the delegation arrived in Paris, although the situation in France was turbulent, King Carlos was still staying well in the palace, obviously waiting for the Russians to come to negotiate.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, as soon as the negotiations began, the king was frightened and ran away.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although no one knows what the specific content of the negotiations is, judging from the speed at which King Carlos ran away, the Russians must have done nothing.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The brothers hope that the Vienna government will intervene and appease the situation a little. No matter what, the Russians must be given a chance to perform and prove themselves.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The problem is that Carlos ran away as soon as he could. The relatives of the Bourbon dynasty did not go to join him, but ran to Vienna without saying a word. What kind of thing is this?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was so silent that everyone thought Carlos had gone to Spain. When he showed up in Vienna, everyone knew it was a false shot.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thinking about it in depth, there is actually nothing wrong with it. It is true that Spain has relatives from the same family. The problem is that they were still enemies in the previous battle for the throne. Although the relationship eased later, the relationship between the two parties was still not close.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The most important thing is that Spain has too much time to take care of itself, and it is impossible to get involved in France's bad things, unless it is to add insult to injury.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Relationships between royal families?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   How do you expect a little kid king who has just finished breastfeeding to support them in public opinion for the sake of family interests?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since it’s of no use, then just don’t cause trouble. If you save a point of love, you will lose a point, but it will affect the harmony of the family.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It would be easier to run to Vienna, because only here can the problem be solved!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There are only a few European powers, and the only ones capable of stopping the Russians' actions are the HRE and Britain.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Carlos is not in trouble, so he will not go to London to humiliate himself. Even in order to prevent the Vienna government from finding excuses to refuse, he simply hid his identity and sneaked in secretly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Facts have proved that Carlos’ plan was successful. From the moment the French king appeared in Vienna, Franz, a melon-eater, was successfully dragged into the water.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   No one likes to be plotted, and Franz is no exception. Except for the initial welcome banquet and courtesy attendance, Franz ignored Carlos for the rest of the time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If you can’t eat melon anymore, then you have to find a way to solve the problem. As for how to solve the problem, it depends on the luck of the French.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Solving it at the source, solving it in a muddy manner, or releasing a bigger problem to cover up the previous problem are all solutions.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Out of a responsible attitude, Franz summoned Foreign Minister Weisenberg at the Vienna Palace to discuss the aftermath.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Let’s talk about the current situation in France first?”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a qualified melon-eater, Franz has been paying close attention to news related to the unrest in France in recent times. But now he only reads newspapers, not intelligence.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After all, editors have always given full play to their imaginations and artistically processed this kind of international news that the public loves to hear before publishing it. It is far more readable than boring intelligence materials.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “The truth” has never been an important thing to the melon-eating masses. As long as one's own interests are not involved, liveliness only needs to look good, no matter who wins or loses.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Watching experts and scholars guess and brag and make bets out of thin air is a kind of fun in itself, just like watching monkeys in a zoo.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Yes, Your Majesty.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Foreign Minister Weisenberg: “Since Carlos left Paris, the French government has been depleted of people. Even the police maintaining law and order have been put on long leave, and social order has collapsed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before evacuating Paris, Carlos issued a proclamation. Not only did it accuse the Russian army of atrocities, but it also shifted all the responsibility to the Russians.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Contradictions have been put on the table, and a nationwide anti-Russian wave is sweeping across the Russians.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to prevent the situation from collapsing, the Russians also took measures. They first disarmed the French army and then stepped up the arrest of anti-Russian elements.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   These measures have curbed the anti-Russian wave in the short term, but with the shutdown of the French government, no one is now distributing relief supplies. It is inevitable that hunger and cold will force the French people to embark on a path of violent resistance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not long ago, we also found a 120mm howitzer in a smuggling boat seized by the navy off the coast of France.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Interrogation of relevant personnel revealed that they had been involved in this smuggling activity for more than three months, and the accumulated smuggled equipment was enough to arm two regiments.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is just what we caught by accident. There will be more smuggling ships that we did not catch. In addition, some of our allies are also engaged in the arms smuggling trade in France.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The weapons and equipment imported from France are probably enough to carry out a large-scale battle. The most important thing is that these smuggling activities are all premeditated.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There are various signs that the French, who are unwilling to fail, are gathering strength and want to get rid of their shackles.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The atrocities committed by the Russian army only catalyzed the outbreak of conflicts in advance and brought them moral support.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is only one force in France that can use such a large amount of energy to smuggle and cover up the news.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It turns out that our King Carlos is not as simple as he seems. Everything they are doing now is just preparation for their next plan.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I just don’t know whether their ambition is just to get rid of their shackles, or whether they want to restore the French Empire. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Honestly speaking, Franz was a little excited deep down when he heard this answer. The facts are as expected, there is indeed a dark hand behind the chaos in France.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It’s true that he plays a trumpet and quarrels with people in newspapers. King Carlos, who seems weak and weak, is indeed the big boss behind the scenes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The joy of being a keyboard warrior is that simple. As he got older, Franz became older and more mischievous.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A bad taste is a bad taste. After all, reality is not a game. There is no chance to start over after failure. France is the best example. After losing once, it fell from the clouds to the abyss.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “So, the Russians were unlucky this time and got themselves here?”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Franz asked in a teasing tone.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was never a secret to the Vienna government that there was a secret resistance force lurking in France. No big country with a long history will succumb so easily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the anti-French war severely damaged France, it did not interrupt the spiritual inheritance of the French people. The French, unwilling to accept defeat, must resist.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It’s just that no one expected that Carlos would become the leader of this group of people. Of course, this is only a slight surprise.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Under the traditional European cultural system, if you want to accomplish something big, you must find a well-known figure with charisma.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As the current king of France, Carlos is naturally everyone's first choice.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Different from the democratically elected Bonaparte dynasty, Carlos was not only born into the orthodox Bourbon dynasty, but was also recognized as the king of France by the international community.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This increases operability.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Theoretically, as long as the French act a little miserably, Carlos steps forward to find support from the international community, and then chooses a suitable reason to launch an attack, there is still hope to expel the Allied forces stationed in the country.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even if the plan is exposed, Carlos will not suffer much personal loss.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As the King of France supported by the Continental Alliance, as long as he made no serious mistakes on the surface, the Vienna government would not be able to slap him in the face and remove him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even if other people had this idea, Franz would not allow it. Deposing a king involves the common interests of the monarchy and must not be done hastily.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As long as Carlos jumps out and shouts anti-Shinra without knowing it, Franz will not attack him. Doing things secretly is a basic quality that any qualified politician must possess.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If nothing else, there are even members of the Anti-French Alliance who are smuggling arms to France for their own benefit?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Check it out and find out...”, that is obviously overthinking. This kind of thing cannot be brought to light at all. Although it is someone else who smuggles arms, it is Shinra who produces these arms.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone knew that the flow of weapons into France would exacerbate the chaos in France, but everyone did it anyway.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In addition to the great benefits, what is more important is the thinking of “If I don’t do it, others will do it too”. Whatever happens in the end, it’s better to just make the money yourself.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The failure to stop this behavior is not just for the sake of a small advantage. The fundamental reason is that the chaos in France was originally caused by the indulgence of the Vienna government.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The power of hatred is huge. Unless the spine is completely broken, France, which has recovered its strength after twenty or thirty years, will be in trouble again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Obviously, a slap from a big country like France can only hurt him but not kill him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For the long-term stability of the European continent, the Vienna government not only pretended not to notice the undercurrents within France, but also secretly promoted them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It’s a pity that it was too early to be exposed, and it also gave the French an opportunity to gain support from the international community.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For the sake of the international reputation of HRE, the next action to suppress France can only be carried out by the Russians.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The tragic tsarist government made a knife without even realizing it. No wonder Franz would gloat, after all, this opportunity is so rare.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Foreign Minister Weisenberg: "Yes, Your Majesty. The Tsarist government has bumped into it in a daze, and the French plan to accumulate strength will no longer be able to hide it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, the tsarist government may also be mentally prepared. After all, in previous smuggling campaigns, the Russians had always held the lion's share.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maybe after the war broke out, the bullets hitting Russian soldiers still escaped from the hands of the Russian troops stationed in France. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The greatest arms dealers always sell weapons to their enemies, and then use them on themselves. Now the Russians are about to use practical actions to explain this truth to the world.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After wandering for a few steps, Franz said slowly: "Then let's add another fire and send the Russians a shell that can be used to counterattack with public opinion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Find the media to publish the evidence that the French were smuggling arms and violating the Treaty of Vienna, and see how Carlos explains it. "
