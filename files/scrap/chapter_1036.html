   Chapter 1036 The enemy is in Congress
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Where does the money come from?”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Finance Minister Pavel Lisitsian issued a soul-searching question.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   No one can give a definite answer to the question of how poor the Tsarist government was. In short, it is certain that there is no money to build the Siberian Railway.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As early as 1891, the Tsarist government organized road experts to launch the Siberian Railway exploration plan. Yes, it was started after Nicholas II was assassinated in Japan.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Alexander III was a pacifist among the czars, he was also a good father. If it were not for transportation restrictions, it is estimated that the Russo-Japanese War would have started early after the Anglo-Russian War ended that year.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Whether it was because of a moment of anger or preparation, the Siberian Railway project was launched.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The results of the exploration were terrible. Starting from Moscow, we had to pass through vast pine forests, cross the Ural Mountains, and cross the vast Siberian tundra before finally reaching the Pacific Ocean.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It’s just that the journey is far away. No matter how far it is, it can’t compare to Shinra’s circular railway. The key is the harsh natural conditions.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The same is true for railway construction. If the construction cost of the plain railway is 1, then the construction cost of the Siberian railway may be 2, 3, 4...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Having no money in my pocket, I am not brave enough to do things. Just when the Tsarist government was hesitant to launch the Siberian Railway construction plan, the Vienna government took action.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The equally alluring "Central Asian Railway Plan" was released, making the tsarist government even more hesitant. But before the Russians hesitated for long, the Vienna government helped them make up their mind - "aid in construction"!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When you open the map, you will know that whether it is the Siberian Railway or the Central Asian Railway, the construction cost is an astronomical figure.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is undoubtedly a fatal thing for the tsarist government, which is not rich enough, to bear this expense. In order to build the Siberian Railway in the original time and space, the Russians also lived frugally.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   From 1891 to 1901 alone, the tsarist government invested 1.46 billion rubles, far exceeding the military expenditure during the same period.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After 13 years of hard work, the world's longest main railway line began to open to traffic on July 13, 1904. The subsequent construction was eventually bumpy and bumpy, and it lasted until 1916 before it was completed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In comparison, the construction conditions of the Central Asia Railway are still a little better, of course only a little better.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although you don’t need to be surrounded by frozen soil all year round, the endless mountains in Afghanistan are also miserable.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Whether it was for strategic needs or for the sake of its own wallet, the tsarist government decisively chose the Central Asian Railway.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even if it knew that the Vienna government was plotting against Britain and Russia, the Tsarist government had no room to refuse.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the words of an optimistic minister in the Tsarist government: "No matter how many calculations the Austrians have, the Central Asian Railway is always beneficial to the empire. Whether to go south or not, the initiative is still in our hands."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is nothing wrong with it in theory. The initiative to go south is indeed in the hands of the Tsarist government, and it is impossible for the Vienna government to make decisions for them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It's just that this can fool ordinary people. If such a large piece of fat meat in India is recently placed on the dining table, and you don't use a knife and fork to cut it, is it still a woolly bear?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Essentially, the Economy Minister’s proposal to help the Russians build the Siberian Railway is the same. As long as the railway is open to traffic, nothing needs to be done, the greedy fur bears will go out to forage on their own.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   With the bear going eastward will certainly harm British interests, but compared with going south to India, it?s more important.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At that time, it will no longer be Britain's business to curb the growth of the Russians, and HRE will not watch the Russians complete the "Yellow Russia Plan" either.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If done properly, the final outcome will evolve into: Britain and Austria cheating the bear together.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is estimated that after a proxy war, the Russians will be injured again. There are so many that I can’t guarantee that it won’t be difficult to keep them in peace for ten years.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The most important thing is that a thorn was planted in the middle of the Russian-Austrian alliance. With this thorn, even if the two countries did not meet each other at war, they would not be as close as they are now.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If everything goes well, the Tsarist government will still find ways to hold back the HRE in the future Anglo-Austrian struggle for hegemony.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The plan is perfect. The only question is: where will the money to build the "Siberian Railway" come from?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The relationship between Britain and Russia is not as close as that between Russia and Austria. The Vienna government helped the Russians build the Central Asian Railway and only helped advance part of the funds.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Mainly the costs of project exploration, design, management, etc., labor and raw materials were provided by the tsarist government itself.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For the sake of the Russian-Austrian alliance, even if some people in the country raise objections, the Vienna government can handle it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It’s not enough to leave it to Britain. The blood of the Anglo-Russian-Afghan War has not been dried yet?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, the families of the soldiers who died in the Anglo-Russian war will be heartbroken if they use their money and efforts to help the Russians build railways.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If public anger is really aroused, the opposition parties will definitely add fuel to the flames. Although national interests are important, party interests are even more important.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I oppose what the enemy supports, and I support what the enemy opposes. It has always been common in politics. Whether it is correct or not is not important. What matters is what is needed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If the funding gap is only 1.8 million pounds, everyone can still find ways to make up for it, hide it from the public's sight, and use special funds to settle the account.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But as for the Siberian Railway, without an investment of hundreds of millions of pounds, it would not be possible at all.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even if the Russians were to provide labor and materials, it would cost tens of millions of pounds. To use such a large amount of funds, no matter what method is used, it cannot be kept secret.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "It's not just a matter of money. Our relationship with the Russians is so tense. Even if we offer to help build the Siberian Railway, I'm afraid the Tsarist government won't believe it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Unless we just provide money and do not touch the railway exploration, design and construction, they will not be at ease at all. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is the inevitable result. Suddenly one day, the enemy suddenly comes to help you build the railway. Anyone would suspect a conspiracy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   From the perspective of the Tsarist government, the British offered to help build the Siberian Railway. It is estimated that the Russians’ first reaction was: they are here to cause destruction.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After all, the construction of the Central Asian Railway has reached a critical moment and will be opened to traffic in a few years. It is normal for the British to feel pressure.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For the security of India, Britain took action to sabotage the construction of the Central Asian Railway, and there was nothing wrong with it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the Russian Empire was huge, the Tsarist government's material mobilization capacity was limited. The construction of the Central Asian Railway has mobilized a large amount of manpower and material resources. If the construction of the Siberian Railway is started again, it will obviously increase the logistical pressure.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The explanation is a cover-up. No matter what the British government says, the Russians will think it is a British conspiracy to use the Siberian Railway plan to delay the progress of the Central Asian Railway construction.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Helping with exploration design and construction, not to mention. The railway that the British helped build, who knows whether it will be used in the end?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As Flora said, unless they just give money and leave everything to the Russians themselves, the tsarist government will not be at ease at all.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The problem is that the British government is still worried about just giving money. Who can guarantee that after the Russians got the money, they spent it on the construction of the Siberian Railway instead of on military expenses for the southward march to India?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The British government has no such thing as moral integrity, and neither does the Tsarist government. It is really difficult for two countries that lack the most basic trust to cooperate.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Foreign Secretary Cameron: “The issue of trust is actually not difficult to solve. If it is not convenient for us to come forward, a third country can come forward to communicate with the Russians.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is not difficult to persuade the Russian military industry to agree to build the Siberian Railway. The current Tsar is Nicholas II. The unpleasant trip to Tokyo has always made Nicholas II resentful.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   From Nicholas II's personal standpoint, the temptation to go eastward to seek revenge on the Japanese was probably greater than going south to India.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After all, we are not soft persimmons. Even if the Central Asian railway is opened to traffic, the Russians' chances of winning are still not high.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Compared with going south, going eastward has a significantly higher success rate and will bring greater benefits.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If the Russians can realize the Yellow Russia plan before the struggle for hegemony comes to an end, then it will be another three-legged pattern.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You can be the boss yourself, and no one wants to be the younger brother, let alone an arrogant furry bear.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even though Russia-Austria relations seem to be very good, many Russians are actually unconvinced by the Holy Roman Empire's position as the European hegemon.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This bait is enough to make the Russians take the bait. As long as the Tsarist government takes this step, the Russian-Austrian alliance will be over.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Vienna can tolerate a powerful Russian Empire, but it will never tolerate a Russian Empire that threatens itself.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In a sense, the Russians pose a much greater threat to the Holy Roman Empire than we do.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After all, they are both land-based countries and happen to be neighbors. Although the European continent is vast, there is no room for two overlords.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In contrast, the problem of funding is difficult to solve. The gentlemen in Congress will not agree to fund the Russians, even if it is a strategic necessity. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “The enemy is in Parliament”, this is the sentiment shared by every British government. To be honest, the British Parliament has brought more trouble to the government than any other enemy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If Congress and the opposition parties had not held back, the international situation would not have evolved to the current situation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As early as the middle of the European War, the previous British government wanted to intervene with troops, but it wasted a lot of time quarreling in Congress and playing games with the opposition parties.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before the discussion came to a conclusion, the French were in despair. There is no need to say that the dust has settled, so naturally the only option is to sell teammates. It is possible to consider becoming an ally with Britain and share the joys and sorrows, but it is impossible to share the joys and sorrows.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Similar things happened not only once, but going back further, there were also a series of international events such as the previous Ottoman Wars, France's invasion of Italy, Austria's annexation of South Germany, etc.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Britain in 1895 was helpless against the Holy Roman Empire, but Britain forty years ago was absolutely capable of preventing Austrian expansion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not to mention preventing Austria from annexing South Germany, it could at least disrupt Austria's colonial plans. The absolute superiority of the Royal Navy continued until the early 1980s.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before this, the Austrian Navy was a little brother. It wasn't until the advent of the pre-dreadnoughts that the gap was narrowed to the point where they had the ability to harm both.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, because of the times, the two big BOSSs of France and Russia attracted firepower in the front, so that politicians at the time underestimated the threat from Austria.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   By the time the British government began to pay attention, the Holy Roman Empire was about to come out, and it was already too late to do anything.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is everything in this world, but there is no regret medicine. Without paying attention, Britain's hegemony encountered its most serious challenge.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The problems that our predecessors have encountered have now fallen on the British government again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If the Congress cannot be settled, there will be no funding for the Siberian Railway plan; without this railway, it will be impossible to divert the disaster eastward; if the tsarist government does not look eastward, then the ultimate plan to divide the Russian-Austrian alliance will eventually become "in the water" The moon, the flower in the mirror.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After hesitating for a while, Robert Cecil nodded: "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs first found a third party to contact the Russians. There is a layer in the middle. We can at least avoid the anger of the people.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As for the issue of Congress, you should communicate with the members of your party privately first, and I will go visit the Queen. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There was no other way. Prime Minister Robert Cecil was too timid to face the pressure from Congress alone and had to seek more help.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the Victorian era, the British royal family was not a rubber stamp. Although the elderly Queen Victoria has seldom interfered with politics, no one can ignore her existence.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   To suppress opposition voices in Congress, the power of the Conservative Party alone is not enough. For the greater good, Robert Cecil had to turn to Queen Victoria for help.
  </font>
