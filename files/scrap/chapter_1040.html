   Chapter 1040 The Unwilling to Accept the Reality
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Once the cannonball is fired, it will kill people. With the exposure of the arms smuggling case, the Russians suddenly became more confident.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The tsarist government, which was already tough, became even tougher on French issues. Of course, starting from Carlos's escape, whether the Tsarist government's stance was tough or not was no longer important.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The French government is shut down, and even if it wants to find someone to negotiate with, the Russian delegation doesn’t know who to turn to.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Facing the increasingly severe civil-military conflict, the Russian troops stationed in France adopted the simplest and best method—suppression by force.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Once the butcher's knife is raised, the consequences are beyond an individual's control.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On December 21, 1895, the well-prepared French resistance organization ambushed a Russian logistics camp transporting supplies on the outskirts of Paris, kicking off the French anti-Russian war.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It can be seen from the "anti-Russian" slogan that the French, who have been severely beaten by society, have become rational.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Hold on to the Russian army’s previous atrocities and refuse to let go, putting itself in the position of a victim and claiming that it is now fighting for survival.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This approach of controlling the scope of attack is undoubtedly correct.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   · Benefiting from the "barbarian image" that has long been deeply rooted in the hearts of the Russians, and the evidence provided by video materials, European public opinion is sympathetic to the French people.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is a pity that this is the 19th century. Public opinion support is important, but for the tsarist government, which is scolded every day, it is not even scratching the itch.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   International interference does not exist. Politicians are rational and can forget everything except their own position.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the issue of suppressing France, all members of the Anti-French Alliance had the same position. Even though everyone felt that the Russians had gone too far, for the sake of the overall situation, countries still chose to support them secretly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After all, every time the Russian army makes troubles, it consumes the national vitality of France. To the neighbors, only when France is weak can we become good neighbors.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Vienna government took the lead in failing to act, and other European countries followed suit. Except for the same few countries with military garrisons in France that felt a little pressure, the rest were just masses.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Out of support for his allies, Franz announced very generously that he would provide unlimited "free" potatoes to Russian soldiers on the front line.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is no other way, who can make Shinra have another good potato harvest this year?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   With the soaring potato production and the shrinking consumer market, people in the Ministry of Agriculture are almost worried.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Shredded potatoes, mashed potatoes, potato flour, potato cakes, potato noodles, potato wine, canned potatoes, fried, steamed, braised, stir-fried...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The foodies' fighting power is obviously not enough. After gathering dozens of potato recipes from many countries, they still cannot digest the harvest of potatoes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Unlike wheat, potatoes are not suitable for long-term storage. If it is really piled up in the warehouse for three to five years, mold and germination will be a minor problem, and the worst fear is that it will really turn into "mashed potatoes".
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order not to waste the food, Franz decided to give it to the Russians. Lest one day the bureaucrats of the tsarist government make another mistake and cause the Russian army in front to run out of food.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is no joke. Based on long-term accumulated experience, once the Russian army goes on an expedition, it is almost 100% likely that there will be logistical problems.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even after the completion of Alexander II's reforms, the Tsarist government no longer lacked food. But having food at home and having food on the front line are two different concepts.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Transporting grain from the Russian Empire to France was also a challenge for the Tsarist government. Now that the Vienna government has helped solve the food problem for the soldiers, the Russian army's logistical pressure has been directly reduced by less than half.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The only problem is that the Russian soldiers on the front line have to eat potatoes every day. It is estimated that after the war is over, these guys will become jealous after smelling potatoes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But this is not a big problem. Gray animals have never been picky about their food. Starving while serving in the Russian army is nothing new.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Moreover, as long as the Russian soldiers are not stubborn, they will give full play to their subjective initiative and find more food locally to supplement.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The outside world generally believes that the previous atrocities committed by the Russian army were due to poor military discipline; but in Franz's opinion, the poor military discipline of the Russian soldiers was also forced out by the bureaucrats of the tsarist government.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Needless to say, the pitiful military expenditures are not much. There is not much money in the first place, and they are often owed in arrears. Even if they are paid, they must be discounted.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the Russian Empire, the troops that can get full military expenses are definitely the direct descendants of the direct lineage, and usually they need to be paired with a strong officer.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Crying children are fed by milk, applicable everywhere. I'm afraid that if the chief officer is indifferent and unwilling to fight for it, then the soldiers below will be miserable.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Delays and shortages in the supply of logistical supplies are routine operations. Bureaucrats are good at calculating economic accounts. If the monthly supplies arrive three days late, then it will be enough to distribute supplies for eleven months in twelve months of the year.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The remaining month will naturally be owed. If it keeps rolling like this, at a suitable point in time, the old debts in front of it will be wiped out and become the personal income of the bureaucrats.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In this context, if you don’t find a way to start a side job, then when the military service is over, you will be empty-handed when you return home. How can you have the dignity to meet your parents at home?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   King Carlos, who was stranded in Vienna, was dumbfounded on the spot after receiving the news that the Vienna government was sponsoring potatoes for the Russian army for free.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There are not so many coincidences in politics, especially the actions of the hegemonic country, which will be deeply interpreted.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was clear that Franz presented potatoes to the Russian army just to avoid "the cheap beans hurting the farmers", and by the way, he pledged the friendship between the two countries.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After all, the war has started, and it won’t be long before the Russians will place a large arms purchase order again. It is also appropriate to carry out some activities now to give back to old customers appropriately.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Fell into Carlos's eyes, this became a political signal for the Vienna government to support the Russians. This is obviously bad news for the French government, which wants to expel the Russian army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Austria Grand Hotel, the most luxurious palace villa. French ministers who had taken a detour from Spain gathered together. Perhaps they were too tired from the journey and did not have enough rest, so many of them were not in a good state of mind.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Glancing at everyone, Carlos said apologetically: "You have just arrived in Vienna. Logically speaking, you should let everyone rest for a while. But the current situation is very unfavorable to France, so we can only be lucky.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You may not know that for so long after I arrived in Vienna, Franz only showed up once at the welcome banquet and then went on vacation in the palace.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even when high-level officials from the Vienna government met with me, they avoided me and did not give us a chance to have in-depth communication at all. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Carlos felt bitter, knowing that the last time he came to Vienna, he did not enjoy this kind of treatment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The emperor was able to spend his vacation in his own palace, which was indeed "fake". When you make up an excuse, you have to be sincere at least!
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For example: physical discomfort, poor mental state, busy at work... There are so many excuses, but he just got an emperor to spend a "vacation" at home.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   That’s all. Compared to the veteran Emperor Shinra, Carlos is just a junior, and it doesn't matter if he suffers a little injustice.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, high-level government officials also avoided seeing it, which is a bit unreasonable. As a king, you have already lowered your arrogance enough by going to find someone in person.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   No matter whether we can reach an agreement or not, we must give him some face to receive him and have an in-depth communication before talking about it again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is a pity that Carlos, as an uninvited guest, is so unwelcome in Vienna.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, it is only the top officials of the Vienna government who do not want to see him. After all, he is also the king of a country, and the Bourbon dynasty is not low on the list. There is still an endless stream of receptions for Carlos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the beginning, Carlos also actively participated, hoping to make friends with the dignitaries of the HRE, and thus influence the negotiations with the Vienna government.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, the reality is very cruel. It’s enough to talk about romance. Once politics comes up, everyone becomes bored and just watch Carlos perform a one-man show.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Carlos also came to his senses after attending several banquets. These guys hired him just to keep up appearances, and no one really wanted to have a close relationship with him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If the nobles who entertained Carlos knew that Carlos had come to a conclusion, they would definitely cry out that they were wronged.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ask for help when you meet, or is it something that involves national interests? How can anyone dare to have a "deep friendship" with him?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Identity determines stance. As vested interests in the existing international system, no matter how miserable France is now, the HRE nobles will not have any sympathy, let alone any sympathy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The aristocratic world is also very cruel. If you don't know your place clearly, it is impossible to survive in this circle.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Foreign Minister Pietro advised: "Your Majesty, calm down! The indifferent response of the Vienna government is indeed very detrimental to us, but we have to see the other side.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   From the beginning to the end, the Vienna government has not made a public statement on the anti-Russian movement, which proves that there is still room for maneuver.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The relationship between Russia and Austria seems to be very good, but there are also hidden conflicts. The long border between the two countries is the biggest hidden danger.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   No matter how good the relationship between the two countries is, once an opportunity arises to defeat the other party, the other party will never show mercy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If the Vienna government really supported the Russians, it would have already convened an alliance meeting and brought together all the European countries to help the Russians deal with the aftermath.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Perhaps in the eyes of the Vienna government, it is in their best interest to watch us and the Russians fight and consume each other's strength. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Reasonable analysis, almost close to the truth. However, no one was happy at all.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If the Foreign Secretary’s judgment is accurate, then “can France defeat the Russians in its current state?”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Soul torture from deep within, no one can give an exact answer, or is unwilling to give an answer. Because their judgment is not the result they want.
