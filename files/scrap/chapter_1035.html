   Chapter 1035: Diverting trouble to the east
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is self-evident what will happen to the Moroccan tribes who originally hated Spain after obtaining a large number of weapons and ammunition.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the arms sellers are all wearing British vests and continue to pretend to be the British government to support Morocco’s anti-Western movement, that’s even more important.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is a precedent of supporting the Cuban independence movement, and it is also a very natural operation to secretly support the Moroccan anti-Western movement.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At least according to the thinking mode of the Moroccan tribal chief, there is no reason to doubt at all. What's more, everything else can be deceived, but genuine weapons and ammunition cannot lie.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The difference in cognition fills the final loophole in this scam. The chiefs never imagined that weapons and ammunition that were priceless in their eyes would be no more expensive than potatoes and wheat in the eyes of another wave of people.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The gun is the courage of the Moroccans. As the saying goes, "If you have a gun in your hand, you will not panic in your heart." The chiefs who had obtained weapons suddenly became more confident when facing the Spanish colonists.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Stubbornly, it doesn’t exist. You must know that there is support from the British Empire behind them. Looking at the British warships in the Strait of Gibraltar opposite gives the chiefs unparalleled confidence.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Driven by hatred and interests, the Spanish immigrants in Morocco were in bad luck for a while. Being beaten is nothing at all. Those who can save a life are all lucky, while the unlucky ones are all sent to meet God.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Fortunately, there are no cannibal tribes in Morocco, otherwise I might have to go to the barbecue grill.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is nothing wrong with the government taking the blame for civil conflicts. The decadent Moroccan government cannot control the tribes below it internally, and it dares not offend the great powers externally.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The same was true in the original time and space. The Spaniards and local Moroccan tribes fought several wars, and the Moroccan government pretended to be deaf and dumb.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The decadent Moroccan Sudanese government is worried, and the Spanish government, which is in endless troubles, is also not feeling well at the moment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the one hand, the personal and property safety of expatriates must be guaranteed; on the other hand, tired Spain is no longer able to open a third front.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Diplomacy is actually just a bluff. The indigenous tribes do not buy it, and just scaring the Moroccan government will not help.
  </font>
 </font>

   Madrid, Cabinet Room.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   From the moment he entered the venue, Prime Minister Antonio tapped his fingers on the table, as if he was lost in endless thought.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Everyone is here, let’s start today’s meeting! I believe you have all received the news, and what we were most worried about has happened.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Following the rebellions in the Philippines and Cuba, Morocco has also become unstable. Native tribes who are hostile to us, funded by the British, are causing us trouble.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What measures should be taken next to safeguard the interests of the empire is the topic we need to discuss today. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Whether the British support the Moroccan anti-Western movement or not, the British must now support it. This is a political necessity.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   To this day, whether the Spanish government wants it or not, it must stand against the British.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The money of the Vienna government is not free. If it does not take a clear stand, the situation in Morocco will not only be turbulent, but also in Spain.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Different from the notorious British who were blocked by the strait, the influence of the Holy Roman Empire on the European continent was much more terrifying.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If the Vienna government stopped supporting them and switched to supporting the revolutionary party, Spain would not only be unable to hold its colonies, but even the mainland would be plunged into chaos.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the Vienna government, which is the stronghold of conservatives, cannot support the Revolutionary Party now, doesn’t the Spanish government know that?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Politics, no one can be sure. There are too many stories of people shouting about beating and killing while secretly providing support in politics.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Anyway, the relationship between Britain and Spain has always been bad, and recently they were cheated by the British on the colonial issue, so they might as well just go all the way to the dark side and directly oppose the British.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, the Spanish government’s anti-British strength is limited to shouting a few political slogans to express its position. It was the Holy Roman Empire that really shouldered the heavy responsibility of resisting the British.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If Britain really fell, Antonio would not mind rushing in immediately to add insult to injury, otherwise it would be better to stay on the safe side.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Military means are obviously not advisable. The war in the Philippines is not over yet, and suppressing the Cuban rebellion has reached a critical moment. Not only the military cannot bear it, but the finances cannot withstand it either!”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Finance Minister Siegfried said earnestly. It's not that he wants to help the military shirk, it's mainly that the government's pockets are really not deep.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even though the Foreign Minister went out for a tour and borrowed two huge sums of money, which was more than expected, no amount of money could withstand the consumption of the gold-eating beast.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Facing the expectant looks from everyone, Foreign Minister Junior frowned, and his good mood disappeared instantly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Don’t have high expectations. The Kingdom of Morocco only has nominal rights to rule the tribes below. Even if it reaches an agreement with them, it cannot restrain the indigenous people below.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You can’t expect us to talk to uncivilized indigenous tribes, right? There are thousands of tribes, large and small, in Morocco, more than our diplomats. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Deep in his heart, Junior had already secretly complained: Do you really think that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is omnipotent and can solve everything?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Knowing that the situation in Morocco is turbulent and someone is behind it, yet still expecting to resolve it through negotiation is simply...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Colonial Secretary Marquis Taboada said indifferently: "Military is not advisable, and diplomacy cannot be achieved. We can't just let it go, right?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Those uncivilized natives don’t understand what international rules are. If the government does not take measures as soon as possible to curb their arrogance, I am afraid that the next attack will not be an exception.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Spain’s face has been trampled to the ground. If we continue to let it go, everyone must know what will happen in the future. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, conflicts between Spain and the indigenous tribes of Morocco have occurred not once or twice.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to resolve this crisis, the Spanish government has sent troops many times. However, the end result is very moving.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the original time and space, Spain fought against the Moroccans until 1926. Finally, it joined forces with the French to carve up the region, and then occupied the northern Moroccan region.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the original time and space lost its richest colonies in the Spanish-American War and Spain's national power suffered a heavy blow, Spain is not much better now.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Other than taking back the Roussillon area, which is more glamorous in appearance, there is not much difference in essence.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although we have Cuba and the Philippines in our hands, these two colonies are fighting for independence. Not only can it not transfuse blood to the country, but it must continue to suck blood from the Spanish government.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The dilemma of choice would be a headache for any government.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Left to the shoulders of the inefficient Spanish government, let alone that. We have meetings and discussions every day, but we can't come up with a feasible plan.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

   London
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As the international situation continues to deteriorate, as a well-deserved overlord of this era, John Bull will naturally not sit still and wait for death.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is almost an open secret that the Vienna government used diplomatic means to continuously besiege Britain. Limited by geopolitics, the British government has no way to compete with HRE on the European continent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Everyone with a discerning eye knows that the longer the current pace continues, the more detrimental it will be to Britain.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But there is no way to delay. Although the Holy Roman Empire is Britain's biggest competitor, the development directions of the two sides are completely different.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   One is centered on land power, supplemented by sea power as its wings; the other is entirely centered on sea power and abandons the development of land power.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If the cards were really laid out now, no one would be able to do anything and no one would say anything. The key is that in the confrontational war of attrition, Britain is likely to be dragged to death by the opponent.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The population is insufficient, the industry cannot keep up, and there is a lack of allies. How dare the British government show its hand?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As long as we don’t break our skin, Britain’s hegemony can still be maintained. Once you really fall out, you may fall immediately.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   A rational government will naturally not engage in unscrupulous gambling on the country's fortunes. It is easy to play table stud, so it is not suitable for players who have already put on shoes.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As an old-school empire, Britain is best at being a troublemaker. It's just that the current situation in Europe limits their performance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, these difficulties did not scare the British. If there are no conditions, then create the conditions yourself.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Attacking Spain was only the first step. It seemed that Britain did not gain much from it, but it took away a helping hand from HRE.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The only problem is that they overestimated the strength of Spain and misjudged the importance of Spain to the HRE.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, this can only be regarded as Spain's misfortune. Britain does not want to compete with the three major powers on its own, and must find opportunities to divide the relationship between Russia and Spain and the HRE.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Russian-Austrian alliance is not easy to break, so the only choice is to attack Spain. The drive to drive a wedge between Austria and Spain was indeed successful, but Spain was almost destroyed, and the hatred between the two countries flourished.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The old and new grudges were combined, and the relationship between Britain and Spain was completely cold. Fortunately, Spain was in decline and was unable to retaliate, otherwise the London government would have capsized this time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It doesn’t matter if the process is tortuous, as long as the end result is good, that’s fine.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although there were not many real gains, Britain was still the nominal winner after taking down Spain.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Smashed the possible "Austro-Russian Anti-British Alliance". Yes, just because of a "possibility", it caused Spain to fall into disgrace.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this stage, the competition between the great powers is so cruel. If you feel threatened, you can beat you down. The reason is as simple as that.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At No. 10 Downing Street, the British Cabinet meeting begins again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Prime Minister Robert Cecil: “The Russian-Austrian Alliance lasted for almost half a century, and if we go back further, it can last until the last century.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Through the long-term alliance, the interests of the two countries have been intertwined. It is difficult for us to separate them simply by relying on traditional methods.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But this alliance poses too great a threat to us. Once we turn against each other one day, we will face threats from two powerful countries.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Russians went south to India, and the HRE broke out of the Mediterranean. Asia, Europe, the United States, and Africa will all become battlefields, and the empire will not be able to deal with so many fronts at the same time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The time to test us has come. If Britain's hegemony wants to continue, the Russian-Austrian alliance must be broken.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At the worst, one of the countries must remain neutral in the event of a conflict. The empire cannot face two enemies at the same time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   We are running out of time. One-third of the Central Asian Railway built by the Vienna government for the Russians has been completed, and the railway is likely to be opened to traffic before 1900. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Only talking about the Russo-Austrian Alliance and not the Continental Alliance, it is natural that Robert Cecil did not ignore it. The main reason is that the Russian-Austrian alliance is deeply rooted, while the Continental Alliance is just a grassroots team.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Despite its response to the previous economic crisis and intervention in the Philippines campaign, the Continental Alliance played an important role in strengthening the cohesion of the alliance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But the Caotai team is the Caotai team. If you want to straighten out the grievances and resentments within the alliance, it cannot be done in a short while.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Let European countries serve as their wings and wave the flag, no problem. If these countries really send troops to go to war with Britain, Vienna's face will not be so easy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, the most important thing is strength. After Spain was abolished, only two major countries, Russia and Austria, were left in the European Continental Alliance. Even if the other countries dared to participate in hegemonic disputes, they did not have enough strength.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even if Shinra finds a way to drag these small countries into trouble, don't expect these helpless people to really do anything. The existence of the Continental Alliance is purely of political significance rather than military significance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In contrast, the Russian-Austrian Alliance is what Britain has to face. The Russians took India, and the HRE took Britain's remaining colonies and hegemony. The distribution of interests was clear at a glance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Foreign Secretary Cameron: “We have tried to divide the relations between Russia and Austria, but everyone knows the final result, and it was in vain every time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The bureaucrats of the tsarist government have been corrupted by interests. The Russian-Austrian alliance is tied to their personal interests. Anyone who wants to cut off their financial resources will be hit hardest.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not to mention the Vienna government, its internal stability was terrible, and it was suppressed by an emperor with the highest prestige since the establishment of the Habsburg dynasty.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If that's all, the key point is that after the tsarist government's strategic shift to the south, there is no core conflict of interest between Russia and Austria.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   No matter how we try to provoke relations between the two countries, the Russians’ first strategic goal is always India, while the HRE’s strategic goal is world hegemony.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It just so happened that we blocked the way of Russia and Austria at the same time and became their common enemy. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Common enemies + common interests = closest allies.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The formula of truth is placed here, and no one can overturn it. It is indeed embarrassing to expect the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to break up the Russian-Austrian alliance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Otherwise the disaster will be diverted to the east?”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Economy Minister Aquinas suggested: “The Russians’ strategic target choice is not just India, there is also a land in the east that is as wealthy as India.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is also a Yellow Russia strategy within the Tsarist government. The only problem is transportation. Since the Austrians can help the Russians build the Central Asian Railway, we can also help the Russians build the Siberian Railway.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Given the greed of the Tsarist government, they would not give up their ambitions in the East. If you can be the boss, no one wants to be the hard-working second child.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is impossible for the Russians not to know that once the HRE gains hegemony, the honeymoon period between the two countries will be over.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
