   Chapter 1042 Patriot
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Washington, the political capital that symbolized American independence, was reduced to a border city after the Civil War. However, the stubborn United States government still moved the capital back after the war.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   To this day, the traces left by the war have long since disappeared. Only in man-preserved history museums can you still see the trauma left by the war.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Originally, it was intended to make the people of the United States realize their shame, become courageous, work hard, and work hard to unify the United States. However, as times have changed, the nature of these cultural relics has also changed, becoming an important part of the anti-war wave.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is no way. As a country composed of immigrants from all over the world, everyone really does not have a strong understanding of the concept of "unification".
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Irish immigrants and English immigrants will never pee in the same gourd. Italian immigrants and French immigrants still perpetuate hatred and discrimination between white people and people of color...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The European world sowed the seeds, but the United States has to bear the consequences. Too many ethnic conflicts are intertwined, and internal problems have always plagued this new country.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, the same is true for the original space and time. Many people in later generations thought that Americans were very "stoic". Although they had strong national power, they tolerated it until after World War II.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As everyone knows, the real United States is far less powerful than they imagined. The weak central government, ethnic conflicts and the unlimited power of the states were all problems faced by this new country.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The internal friction continues every day, consuming too much of this country’s energy. From the 19th century to the early 20th century, successive U.S. governments worked hard to eliminate internal friction.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the end, as time went by, the immigrants' mutual understanding deepened, cross-ethnic marriages increased, and the differences within the white race were alleviated, and the country became truly strong.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This self-integration of original time and space lasted for hundreds of years, let alone now.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   With the independence of the South, the central government of the United States was directly disgraced, and its control over the states became increasingly weak.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In a country of immigrants, people’s sense of belonging to the country is inherently low. Ordinary people cared more about their own personal quality of life than reunifying the South.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The division is not entirely without benefits. There is also a wave of vested interests, such as several grain-producing states in the central plains, who do not want the South to come back and compete with them for the market.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Also uninterested in unification were the western states. Because it does not involve their own interests, many people have a cold-shouldered attitude towards reunification.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   To put it simply, there is no problem in unifying the South, but it is not possible to ask them to join the army and go to the battlefield.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This tendency was manifested during the Civil War. Many states with small interests openly resisted the central government's military recruitment.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, the intervention of the great powers is also an important factor. Your own safety is threatened, no matter how much support you give, you must think twice before acting.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ˜Those who really hope to reunify the north and the south are actually the eastern states where capital consortia gather. Although the capitalists have sufficient motivation to support reunification, it will not work if they are allowed to go to the battlefield and fight tooth and nail.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In this regard, Jewish capital has set an example for the American bourgeoisie: “They have everything except the state.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Ordinary people do not want to fight, and those who want to fight are unwilling to go to the battlefield. It can be said that it is inevitable that the road to the reunification of the United States will be frustrated.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In this context, it is not surprising that the anti-war wave has become the mainstream of society. After all, the capitalists who support unification by force are only a very small minority among all citizens.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Regarding all this, President Grover Cleveland, who is keen to promote national unity, "sees it with his eyes and is anxious in his heart", but he is powerless.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In fact, Grover Cleveland was not the first president to want to reunify the South after the Civil War. Before this, many exes have tried, but unfortunately they all ended in tragedy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Especially his predecessor, who coincided with the outbreak of the European War, was a period when European countries had the lowest ability to intervene in the Americas.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If you want to unify the South by force, then is the best opportunity. All the countries in Europe were busy fighting against the French, and only Britain remained aloof.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As a single country, the London government would not be so determined to participate in the Civil War. After all, it is the long-term national policy of the British to put Europe first and then the United States.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Regrettably, there was a fierce quarrel within the United States over whether to initiate unification by force.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   From the congressional government to ordinary people, fierce conflicts broke out around this issue.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Many state governments in the United States have publicly stated that they will not send troops to participate in a new Civil War, which made it impossible for the predecessor who proposed the unification plan to step down.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Before the United States could reach unity of opinion, the European War ended early. Once the opportunity is missed, it will never come back again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Confederate States in the South are not soft persimmons. They can be said to be second only to the United States in the American world. Although the gap in comprehensive national strength between the two sides is more than doubled, in terms of military strength, this gap has been infinitely narrowed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If European countries intervene again, these gaps will no longer be gaps, but may become an advantage.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You must know that the European powers often issued warnings to them on the issue of unifying the South by force. Even after the establishment of the Continental Alliance, they did not forget to send people to remind them to behave themselves.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If you want to destabilize the Americas, a joint and mixed fight between the great powers is indispensable. By then, let alone unifying the south, even the north will have to be divided again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For specific reference, you can refer to the "zonal occupation plan" proposed by European powers when they intervened in the Civil War.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   To put it simply: Britain, France, Austria and Western countries took the lead in uniting with European countries to send troops to dismember the United States, and then implemented partitioned occupation.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, this is just a threat. If we really do send troops, I guess everyone will have to think rationally about whether it's worth it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, this method of intimidation is still very deterrent to Americans who have never seen it on the market.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since his predecessor resigned in disgrace, President Grover Cleveland will naturally not be determined to do it again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to achieve national unification, Grover Cleveland decided to adopt a roundabout strategy, namely: provoking conflicts among the major European powers and creating an international basis for unification.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It was against this background that the Cuban independence movement broke out.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As the mastermind behind the scenes, Grover Cleveland only smuggled a few batches of arms and brought Britain and Spain into direct confrontation; by the way, he also planted a seed of doubt between Spain and HRE. It can be said to be very successful.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is a pity that Spain has declined after all, which greatly compromised this plan.
  </font>
 </font>
