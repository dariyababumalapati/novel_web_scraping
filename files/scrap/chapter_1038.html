   Chapter 1038 Complex Russian Politics
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For Franz, the problem can never be solved. As long as you don't take care of it, it is no longer a problem.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   France is in chaos, which is indeed big news to the media, but to the Holy Roman Empire, it is actually not even a minor cold.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since it was the Russians who caused the matter, let the tsarist government sort it out on its own. Anyway, the Shinra did not station troops in France, so even if the fight resulted in bloodshed, the Vienna government would not be anxious.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The only trouble is probably that international public opinion will be very unfavorable. It's just that today is different from the past. As the leader of the Continental Alliance, the Vienna government's anti-mine properties have become much stronger.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The one causing trouble now is not the HRE army. Even if it is criticized by public opinion, the most it can do is accuse the Vienna government of "inaction".
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Inaction” is not a sin. Looking at modern history, we know that the Vienna government’s policy of inaction has continued for many years.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For European governments, “action” by the boss above them is far scarier than “inaction”. If the Vienna government had to take care of everything, it is estimated that the European Union would not be as stable as it is now.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Similar to later generations, if the U.S. government suddenly stopped working and stopped doing things, countries around the world would just celebrate instead of blaming the Americans for inaction.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is only one main reason for not being sprayed, and that is that you have to participate in trivial matters, but when the critical moment comes, you shrink back and refuse to take responsibility.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the chaos in France shows signs of expanding, it has not yet reached the point where it cannot be dealt with. In theory, there is nothing wrong with the Vienna government not taking action for the time being and letting the Russians handle it themselves.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course there is nothing wrong with this, it is just from the perspective of the Holy Roman Empire itself and a third party that has no interest.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The French and Russians at the center of the storm would never think so.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Without the mediation of the Vienna government, the French and Russian governments at this moment have essentially been forced into a corner.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Compromise?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If the Carlos government dares to make concessions, the French people will dare to change their king.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is already very embarrassing if you don’t have the strength to fight against the enemy; if you don’t dare to do non-violence and non-cooperation, how can you prove that you stand with the French people?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The French government had no choice, and the Tsarist government was embarrassed. Nicholas II, who had just succeeded to the throne, encountered this big trouble before he had time to adapt to the supreme power brought by the tsar.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is no point in pursuing right or wrong. Once an in-depth investigation is carried out, the final result will probably be a slap in the face.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   According to the Russian Army Command in France, this was a conspiracy by the French to deliberately provoke conflicts between the Russian army and the local people, which caused the situation to get out of control.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Whether others believe it or not, Nicholas II would not believe it anyway. The French conspiracy may exist, but the main reason for the situation to get out of control is definitely not a small conspiracy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is no way. The damn reporter recorded the atrocities committed by the Russian army. The photos have been published in newspapers and cannot be washed away even if they want to.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Someone even mailed a short video movie to Nicholas II, along with a sincere letter, hoping that Nicholas II would stop the atrocities committed by the Russian army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Let's just say letters. Nicholas II received plenty of similar letters. If we put them all together, they can hold several trains of luggage.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Without bragging, if he lived in the 20th century, Nicholas II could still live a middle-class life by selling waste paper that he received letters from every day.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Especially in recent times, almost all well-known figures in Europe have sent him letters. Be polite and tactfully persuade, but if you don't want to give face, just start scolding.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Fortunately, Nicholas II was well-educated. If he were replaced by a petty tsar, he might have to send people to kill these gesticulating guys.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, no matter how good your self-cultivation is, it cannot withstand the impact of “small movies”. If it weren't for the distance, Nicholas II would definitely call the commander in Paris to him and let him know what it means to give instructions from ear to ear.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I have seen stupid people, but I have never seen such stupid people. Being secretly photographed by a reporter is barely understandable. But if a documentary was filmed at the scene, it would not be justified.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Cameras these days are not small toys. They were so big and were filming from the side. The Russian soldiers on the scene actually did not stop them. Nicholas II could no longer describe it in words.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In short, these video materials are quite detrimental to the tsarist government. I have been peaceful for more than ten years recently, and I have finally squeezed into the circle of European civilization, and now I am about to be kicked out again.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Russian Empire has no intention of taking off the label of "barbaric" and "cruel" in a short time. The international image that was painstakingly cultivated during the era of Alexander III was now completely lost.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Thanks to the blurry video data, it is impossible to accurately identify the identities of the Russian officers and soldiers, otherwise Nicholas II would have to send these wastes to see God.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The situation has deteriorated, and it will be a matter of the future to hold people accountable. The most important thing now is to deal with the aftermath.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Allied headquarters, controlled by the Vienna government, directly ordered the Russian troops in Paris to solve the problem themselves. Whether the tsarist government wants it or not, it can only bite the bullet now.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Saint Petersburg
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the Winter Palace, Nicholas II sat at the top of the table with a gloomy face and said indifferently: "What happened in France has seriously affected our international image.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to reverse these adverse effects and safeguard the interests of the Russian Empire, we must now take decisive measures.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Obviously, Nicholas II still has not understood the point. "International image", once that thing is corrupted, it will be really bad.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is not impossible to recover, but this is definitely not something that can be changed in a short period of time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Instead of worrying about the international image, it is better to find ways to stabilize the situation in France first. These benefits are truly tangible and tangible.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pobedonoschaif reminded: "Your Majesty, the Allied Forces Headquarters has authorized us to handle French affairs with full authority.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The top priority is to stabilize the situation in Paris. The matter of recalling the commander in France and pursuing those responsible can be dealt with after the situation has stabilized. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   (Pobedonoschaev: Nicholas II’s personal teacher and counselor, director of the General Administration of Orthodox Affairs)
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There was no other way. The Allies authorized the Russian troops stationed in Paris to handle the situation with full authority. This seemed to be a sign of great trust, but in fact it was allowing the tsarist government to clean up the mess on its own.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The incident was caused by the Russian troops stationed in France. Now that the situation is out of control, the Tsarist government cannot absolve itself of the blame, even if it wants to shirk it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And the aftermath work must be done well. Otherwise, several other allies with troops stationed in Wuwu will come to cause trouble.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is not a question of whether you are afraid or not. The key is that everyone is eating from the same pot and needs to cooperate with each other. If the relationship is really severed, the situation of the Russian troops stationed in France will be even worse.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   To put it bluntly, if the French really go berserk, the Russian troops stationed in France will not be able to control the situation at all.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Limited by the distance, even if the Russian Empire wanted to reinforce, it would be too late in time and could only rely on the strength of its allies.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Perhaps the strength of a single country is limited, but the combined strength of these dozen countries is actually not too far away from the Russian Empire.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Finance Minister Sergey Witte: “The director is right, the current situation no longer allows us to delay.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Vienna government has now made it clear that it does not want to intervene. The French government is on strike again. From now on, everything we spend in France needs to be financed by ourselves.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The longer the delay, the greater the losses to the empire.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In order to solve the problem as soon as possible, I propose to immediately send a delegation to Paris to investigate the cause of the incident and coordinate relations with the French government.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   No matter what, the French government must be appeased first. Only when they come out to work can social order be restored as soon as possible. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It’s not that Sergei Witte is opposed to violent suppression, the main reason is that the current situation in France is too complicated and violence cannot solve the problem at all.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Those who want to solve the problems seem to be unable to do so, but the Russian troops stationed in France are unable to do so. Considering the financial pressure, it was impossible for the tsarist government to send 1.8 million Russian troops to carry out a purge.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since violence is not an option, the only option is to be reasonable. Anyway, France is a defeated country, so it will be three points behind at the beginning.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Minister of Foreign Affairs Mihajlovic: "I'm afraid this will be difficult to do. The main purpose of the French government's strike and protest is to want us to withdraw our troops from Paris.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, this is precisely the concession we are least likely to make. If there is no garrison, how can we guarantee our war reparations?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   How can the empire’s interests in France be safeguarded?
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even if these do not matter, we must still consider the positions of the countries in the anti-French alliance. The empire's unilateral compromise with the French would only put the empire in a very embarrassing position. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It won't work if you don't object, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' capabilities are limited. It is simply an impossible task to convince the French with a smooth tongue.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The bottom line of the tsarist government is clearly laid out here. The biggest concession is nothing more than: next time you don’t collect taxes personally, then there will be no more.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Chasing the person responsible will be handled internally, and the final result will be nothing more than three drinks as a fine.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The reason why the person involved was punished was not the atrocities committed by the Russian army; it was the failure to block information during the robbery and killing, which put the tsarist government into a passive state.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As for the atrocities committed by the Russian army, the Tsarist government cannot admit it at all. Even if the evidence is sufficient, the tsarist government can only fight to the end.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The French would never be satisfied with such a result.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If you want to use diplomatic means to solve the problem, you must at least throw out a few scapegoats and let the French vent their grievances.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Obviously, it is impossible for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to do this to offend the military.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Not wanting to offend his colleagues, but also unwilling to bear the consequences of failed negotiations, Mihajlovic naturally wanted to tell ugly things up front so that he could shift the responsibility if problems arise in the future.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The civil servants’ positions are not unified, let alone the military. In addition to suppressing by force, it is suppressed by force. It is impossible to take responsibility anyway.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The interests of the empire are certainly important, but personal status and future are obviously more important. Anyone in the position of Minister of War will protect the interests of his younger brother first.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For the soft-hearted Nicholas II, the biggest torture was the constant quarrels at the top levels of the government. Each had his own reasons, and it was really difficult for the Tsar to make a choice among them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Perhaps he was impatient, or perhaps he thought of something, Nicholas II interrupted everyone's discussion.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Well, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will negotiate with the French first. If they understand the current situation and accept our goodwill, that's it; if the French reject our goodwill, let them wake up with bayonets."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Diplomacy + military are two-pronged, working together to solve the problem, exactly as described in the book, and there seems to be nothing wrong with it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As for the effect, you won’t know until you use it. Anyway, Nicholas II is very satisfied now. After considering everyone’s opinions, all aspects have been taken care of.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The only trouble is that the actual executors have another headache. His Majesty the Tsar did not give a clear answer to the question of whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the military should take the lead.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although they knew it was troublesome, everyone present tacitly chose to avoid it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Who takes the lead is not only related to the aftermath of this incident, but also to the ranking of the Ministry of War and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the government's power structure.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is enough for the Tsar to appoint him directly. It is nothing more than a matter of the imperial envoy and does not affect the balance of power.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   However, other people have punctured the window paper, which means that the secret political struggle has been brought to the table, and there is no room for maneuver.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In politics, this is undoubtedly a taboo. Everyone present is smart and knows what can and cannot be done.
  </font>
 </font>
