   Chapter 1043 The good father of the Russian people
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   No matter what, it is always good if the plan succeeds. Everything is difficult at the beginning, but as long as you take the first step, the rest of the journey will be easy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Just when Grover Cleveland was about to start his next plan, a pie fell from the sky and hit him on the head.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The British hope that the United States will take the lead in helping the Russians build the "Siberian Railway."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the surface, an ordinary railroad seemed like nothing, but Grover Cleveland, who was rich in political experience, immediately realized the risks and opportunities involved.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "Divide the Russian-Austrian alliance", "lure the Russians to advance eastward and reduce the military pressure on British India", "calculate against the Russians"... A series of possibilities emerged in Grover Cleveland's mind.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What the eventual consequences will be, Grover-Cleveland doesn’t know. The only thing that is certain is that deteriorating relations between the European powers is a good thing for the United States.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, there are advantages and disadvantages. In order to "direct the trouble southward" and provoke confrontation between Britain and Russia, the Vienna government did not hesitate to spend huge sums of money to help the Russians build the Central Asian Railway.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   All the money has been invested, and the plan is about to succeed. Now that someone suddenly kills the enemy, the Holy Roman Empire will definitely not let it go.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although there is an ocean barrier, offending a top power still poses a huge risk to the United States.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the British government promised to come to the end, Grover Cleveland had no confidence in John Bull's integrity.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After rubbing his forehead, Grover Cleveland asked: "What conditions did the British offer?"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The risk is not terrible. Although it will be uncomfortable to offend the Holy Roman Empire, it will not kill the United States. What is terrible is that there is only a risk but no corresponding reward.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the British do not take action, the United States will also find ways to calculate Russia-Austria relations, but this will be done in secret and cannot be brought to the table.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “The British government promises to withdraw from the four-nation alliance, stop suppressing us, and provide an interest-free loan of 10 million pounds.”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Secretary of State Juan Tripp replied expressionlessly. Obviously, he himself was not very interested in the conditions promised by the British.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   From the moment the European War ended, the so-called four-nation alliance of Britain, France, Austria and Western Europe had collapsed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Stop the suppression” is even more of a joke. Britain's suppression of the United States had ceased to exist in name only twenty years ago.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Let alone now. The energy of the British is not unlimited. There are still the Holy Roman Empire and the Russian Empire in front of them, and the London government simply cannot care about suppressing the United States.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The only thing of value is probably the "interest-free loan of ten million pounds", but this ten million is not really given to them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The United States is just passing through the middle, and in the end all the money will be spent on the Siberian Railway. Not only will they not make any money, they may even lose a lot of money.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You know, lending to the Tsarist government these days is extremely risky. If the Russians go bankrupt again, their investment will be in vain.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Juan can be sure that this day is definitely not far away. The Franco-Russian War had begun, and the Tsarist government had essentially entered a countdown to bankruptcy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Even with the secret support of European countries, the Russians managed to escape this wave of bankruptcy. In the future, if the strategy of moving southward or eastward is launched, the tsarist government will still go bankrupt.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   This is an experience lesson left by history. Whenever a war breaks out, Russia's finances will enter a countdown.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Russians went bankrupt, but the United States had to repay the interest-free loan of 10 million pounds given by the British.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The London government still failed to deal with Congress, so the burden of funding the Russians could only be borne by the United States, and the London government could only provide certain compensation in other aspects.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Grover Cleveland nodded thoughtfully: "Oh, it seems that the terms offered by the British this time are not bad, at least they are not all empty promises."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The sarcasm in his tone betrayed Grover Cleveland's true inner thoughts. Obviously, the compensation offered by the British did not satisfy him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Reading the eyes, Secretary of State Juan responded: "It's really good, but now we still have to increase the price.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is almost impossible to get more from the British, but it seems negotiable with the Russians.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is only natural that we contribute people and efforts to help them build the Siberian Railway and ask for a share of their profits in the Far East. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Different from the original time and space, the post-division United States is not only not so rich in industrial raw materials, but the internal market has shrunk significantly.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You want to expand externally. After looking around, you find that the world has been divided up.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Surrounded by powerful powers, it is obvious at first sight that they are not easy to offend. If given a choice, everyone would not always miss the South.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is no way. Compared with top powers like Britain and Austria, the Southern Alliance is obviously easier to bully.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The current "Siberian Railway Plan" has brought new options to the United States. Since it cannot continue to expand in the Americas, it is better to spread its influence overseas.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the Russian industry is underdeveloped anyway, as an investor in the Siberian Railway, it is not a problem for the United States to follow suit and get a share of the pie.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Grover-Cleveland: "Great suggestion. But before that, we still have to figure out how to deal with the Austrians.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Otherwise if they make trouble, things will be very troublesome. You must know that the Russians already have a Central Asian Railway, so their interest in the Siberian Railway may not be too strong. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although Mao Xiong is powerful, it is still impossible to move south and east at the same time. During the same period, the tsarist government could only choose one of them as a national policy.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Obviously, the southward faction has the upper hand within the Russian Empire. As for the eastward strategy, although there is no shortage of supporters, the poor traffic has given up the idea of ​​​​most people.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Juan sneered and said: "Don't worry, Mr. President. Nicholas II will help us get rid of the Tsarist government. He is an admirer of the Yellow Russia Plan.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Moreover, according to the consistent style of the Vienna government, if the tsarist government wants to make troubles, it would be better not to add fuel to the flames, let alone stop it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You must know that the French-Russian railway has just kicked off, and the Central Asian Railway is still going on. If there is another Siberian Railway, and the Russian Empire's financial resources continue to be troubled, I am afraid..."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Russia-U.S. friendship, in normal times, just shout slogans. Juan didn't feel any pressure to plot against the Russians.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   What’s more, this isn’t all a calculation. As long as the tsarist government could control its own ambitions, it would know its priorities.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is entirely possible to wait until the Franco-Russian War is over and the Central Asian Railway is opened to traffic before starting the construction of the Siberian Railway.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As long as they fight steadily and do not seek death randomly, with the size of the Russian Empire, no one can defeat them.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Nicholas II, who was at the center of the vortex, did not know that a conspiracy against the Russian Empire was being launched. At this moment, he was still immersed in the great victory of the Russian army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Russian troops stationed outside Paris have suppressed the French resistance forces in the Paris area and now have complete control of the city of Paris.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There has always been a saying in the European world that "controlling Paris means controlling France." Judging from the laws of historical development, the Russian army that occupied Paris was not far from victory in the war.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The victor is not blamed. As long as he wins this war, not only can the trouble caused by the Russian army be wiped out, but he can also make another profit by the way.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   With such a great victory on the front line, Nicholas II naturally had reasons to be happy. There was no banquet to celebrate, and it was already on his part to exercise restraint.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Pobedonoschaif: "Your Majesty, our war with the French is far from over. In addition to Paris, there are still a large number of resistance organization members distributed throughout the country.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   With our garrison in Paris alone, it is almost impossible to purge the whole of France. In order to end the war as soon as possible, we should ask for help from our allies! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Some people dare to pour cold water on the Tsar's enthusiasm. Obviously Nicholas II was not as cruel as described in textbooks. A true tyrant has no room for honest advice.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, not being cruel does not mean that Nicholas II was a wise king. Linking the king's personal moral cultivation with his ability to govern is inherently rogue.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Asking for help from allies?”
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   "No!"
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   “Teacher, you are too worried. France today is no longer the France of Napoleon’s time.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Early in the previous European war, their backbones had been broken, and now they were like a pug, with only the ability to wag its tail and beg for food.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   We have sent additional troops to France. Two hundred thousand Russian troops are enough to suppress all dissent. The Russian Empire has been silent for many years. Now it is time to establish its prestige, and the French are the best candidates to establish their prestige! "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Whether this is the time when the Russian Empire needs to establish its prestige, this question cannot be decided for a while, but it must be the time when Nicholas II needs to establish his prestige most.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   I don’t know since what era, every tsar who came to power had to prove his ability in foreign wars.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Evaluating whether a tsar is a qualified tsar, everyone does not look at the tsar's ability to govern, but rather whether he can fight.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The more ferociously he fights in foreign wars and the more brilliant the results he achieves, the higher the tsar's evaluation in the minds of the people.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   For example: Nicholas I, known as the greatest tsar of the Russian Empire, relied on his achievements in defeating the British and French forces and regaining Constantinople.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As for the ability to govern the country, it is enough for a purely feudal emperor to be able to suppress rebellions internally without causing major troubles.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After all, he is a tsar, and he always has a stubborn side. Once you commit to something, it's difficult to pull it back.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Unable to convince Nicholas II, Pobedonoschiev was not disappointed.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The main purpose of persuading the tsar to invite allies to participate in quelling the rebellion was to end the war as soon as possible in order to save military expenses. We were not really worried about being unable to put down the rebels.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As Nicholas II said, the backbone of France has been broken. This kind of severance is not a spiritual severance, but a physical severance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The domestic young labor force suffered heavy losses in the war, and the military-industrial system was also destroyed by the Allies. The surviving elite troops were also sent overseas by Spain to work as mercenaries.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the French upper class, including King Carlos, are supporting the resistance organization, they do so in secret.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There is no way. The anti-French alliance is too powerful. France at its peak could not withstand it, let alone now.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Supporting resistance organizations and inciting people to resist is just to strive for better conditions, not that everyone is ready to fall out with the anti-French alliance.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   If the incident hadn't happened suddenly, they would have definitely continued on, slowly building up strength, and waiting for the international situation to change before taking action.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It is refreshing to jump out and fight the Russians now, but behind the excitement, thousands of French people are lying in a pool of blood.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In a sense, the Russian army’s bloody suppression methods also played a role. Although it aroused more resistance from the French people, it also shocked the French upper class.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Non-violent non-cooperation is enough. If these big shots really jump out to fight the Russians, don't even think about it.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Perhaps it won’t be enough to implicate nine ethnic groups, but the Russians will still keep their word if they implicate the whole family.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   According to incomplete statistics, in the past three months, at least 100,000 French people have fallen to the guns of the Russian army, and more than 500,000 have been exiled to Siberia. In the Paris area controlled by the Russian army, the total population dropped by half.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Without a big figure taking the lead, France's numerous resistance organizations worked on their own and were naturally no match for the Russian army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Of course, this is only the current situation. No one knows what will happen in the future.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Maybe, under the pressure of the Russian army, the French resistance organizations suddenly united. You must know that invasion by foreign enemies will also help promote the unity of all forces.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   …
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Finance Minister Sergei Witte suggested: "Your Majesty, we have captured a large number of prisoners, and keeping them there is a waste of food. It is better to send them to build the Central Asian Railway.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It just so happens that the civilian men we recruited previously have completed their service period, so we can replace them. "
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It doesn't matter whether the civilian husband has completed his service period. The key is that Sergey Witte has his eyes on this group of free labor.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   You must know that building railways was not an easy job in the 19th century. In the absence of sufficient mechanical equipment, we can only rely on manual labor.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At railway construction sites, casualties occur almost every day. It can be said that every section of railway is built with human lives.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   No matter how worthless the gray cattle are, they are still our own. Anyway, people are going to die, and it is better to kill your enemies than to kill your own people.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Without the slightest hesitation, Nicholas II immediately replied: "The Ministry of War will send electricity to the troops on the front line and ask them to work harder to bring back more prisoners of war. The subsequent construction of the Central Asian Railway depends on them."
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   It can be seen that Nicholas II is still a good father to the Russian people when issues of principle are not involved.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
