 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Megakides was a little moved by what he said, but he still had some scruples in his heart: "But...I'm afraid the officials in Crete won't allow me to leave..." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What's the point? So worried!" Siliteos reminded disapprovingly: "With the support of the Theonia Military Affairs Department, even if those officials are dissatisfied, they will not dare to do anything to you!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Under Siliteos' reminder, Megakides finally made up his mind, and he said gratefully: "Thank you, Silitaos!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Just verbal gratitude is not enough." Siliteos said half-jokingly and half-seriously: "I'll wait for you in the future. I became a citizen of Theonia and an officer of Theonia. When I ask you for help, just don't drive me out."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Don't worry, I will definitely help when the time comes!" Si said with certainty.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;

 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the 7th day of the Theonian Games, most of the competition events have been presented to the audience. The traditional Under the redesign and arrangement of the Greek Games competitions by the Theonians, the competition schedule has not only become more fair, but also more exciting, such as racing and boxing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Traditional boxing matches are held in a relatively large venue, and victory is not considered until the opponent is knocked down or surrenders. Players often suffer serious injuries or even death.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the boxing match of the Dionysus Games, both players wear thick gloves and win by hitting the opponent a few times or knocking down the opponent within the specified time. The players are safer and the game is no longer so bloody.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, the competition takes place in a 5-meter-square field bounded by ropes and wooden stakes, which makes it impossible for the players to dodge at will. The competition becomes more intense, long-lasting, and confrontational, and has also won praise from many audiences.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Women and children were also allowed to attend the games due to a significant reduction in player mortality.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The same is true for wrestling matches, which enhance the intensity and confrontation of the match while ensuring the safety of the players and fairness of the match, and even add some interesting links, such as allowing the beautiful kingdom slave girl to hold the hand of the next match during the interval of the match. The number plates wandered around the venue, attracting the attention of male spectators...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even the representatives of Olympia and Delphi fell into deep thought when they saw these novel arrangements and designs in the competition.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, traditional sports events such as "Brawl" are too chaotic and bloody, completely inconsistent with Davos's aesthetics, and are completely excluded from the Theonia Games competitions.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The newly established competition events of the Theonian Games gave the audience huge surprises, such as archery and swimming.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Greeks are a seafaring nation. Most Greeks have been playing in the sea since childhood. Playing and rowing has almost become an instinct. However, no Greek sports have ever included swimming as a competition. It may be because they find it difficult to compete, but The Theonia Games set standards for swimming competitions: the Games preparatory team set aside an area on the banks of the Krati River in the west of Thurii City to build an open sports venue.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A large rectangular pit with a length of 50 meters, a width of 25 meters and a depth of 2 meters was dug in the center of the arena. It was covered with strong and dense Davos cement and then covered with smooth marble. This way, when the water channel leads the water from the Kraty River into the pool , there will be no obvious leakage.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then a rope was hung every three meters at both ends of the wide side of the pool to form eight swimming tracks, so that the conditions for swimming competitions were fully met.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the first Theonian Games allowed contestants to use various swimming styles (people did not have any standard swimming styles at that time), and only set different swimming events based on swimming distance, each game Spectators for the swimming competition still packed the entire venue, and the cheers and cheers echoed on the banks of the Kraty River every day.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the swimmers participating in the swimming competition are not allowed to apply olive oil, under the sunshine and in the rippling clear water, the swimmers' vigorous postures of waving their arms and kicking their legs also show their strength and beauty, and can also inspire the audience's love for the sea. Longing and love.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The same goes for boat racing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Greeks have the conditions to set up a rowing competition, but the reason why it has never been held is probably because most Greeks make a living by the sea. Driving boats, fishing, and doing business are very common. Because it is too common, there is no competition. interest.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But the boat races at the Theonian Games were designed to be fun and competitive.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There are two types of boat races in Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   One is paddle racing, which uses a wooden boat specially made by Turiyi Shipyard for the competition. It is very narrow in width but very slender and can accommodate 4 to 8 paddlers. It has no sails and relies entirely on paddling. Marching, the competition venue is set in the Craty River. Just like the running competition on land, there are preliminaries and finals, and it is divided into several events according to the different schedule and the number of paddlers. The shortest distance is one mile.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the beginning of the competition, the contestants rowed quickly, and the speed of the boat could reach up to more than ten knots, just like the charge of a trireme in a naval battle, which made the spectators on the shore excited.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Another type of rowing competition is the sailboat, which is a racing boat adapted from a small cargo ship by the Turiyi Shipyard. It can only be ridden by one person, and cannot use oars. It can only control the sail to make the boat move forward. Therefore, its competition venue is In the Gulf of Turii, there are no qualifying rounds, all players participate together, starting from the port of Turii and arriving at the large port of Tarentum.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The competition lasts for a whole day, and there are many observation boats along the way to prevent players from cheating.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This competition is entirely to test the contestants' boating abilities in the sea. Therefore, the contestants are all experienced boat owners and fishermen from various regions and city-states. It also attracts a large number of boat owners and fishermen from the Kingdom of Theonia and various city-states. Watch and learn.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the seventh day of the Theonian Games, a very traditional competition that was not very familiar to the people of Theonia began, and that was the racing competition.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Among all the Greek Games, racing is the most popular. After all, humans are always passionate about the ultimate pursuit of speed. Among speed events such as racing and rowing racing, racing is the longest, most tense, and most exciting. It stimulates the passion of the audience, and it is also the most popular among Greek nobles, because according to the regulations of traditional sports games, the championship title of racing competition does not belong to the driver who drives the carriage, but to the person who provides and owns the carriage. , this gave the Greek nobles who had no time to train and could not compete in person the opportunity to win the glory of the sports championship. Therefore, many famous Greek dignitaries have won the championship of this event, such as Alcibiades of Athens and Sparta. King and Tyrant of Syracuse Dionysius...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, the Theonian Games changed the tradition of this game. In the invitation letters sent to various city-states, he emphasized the rules of each event of the Theonian Games. Mentioned: The championship glory of the racing competition is jointly owned by the racing driver and the racing provider, and the prize money is also divided equally between the two.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the traditional Greek Games racing competitions, many drivers were slaves, and it was simply a humiliation for the Greek nobles to let the masters and slaves share the championship honors. However, even so, many Greek city-state nobles signed up to compete, because in Nowadays, when Theonia is powerful and dominates most of the Mediterranean and controls the Greek world, this is a great opportunity for them to show their names in front of the king of Theonia, which will be of great benefit to their future development in the political arena. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not only are these Greek nobles keen on the racing competitions of the Theonian Games, but the Theonian people who like exciting competitive sports are also eager for the long-rumored racing competitions, so on the day of the competition, thousands of Tens of thousands of spectators flocked to the competition venue located in the northern part of the Subali Plain from all directions.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the venue was built so recently, it doesn't even have an official name yet, and is simply called the Thurii Racing Arena.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the Games preparatory team decided to include racing as a competition event, the Thurii City Hall, which had never held a racing competition, sent a delegation to Olympia, Delphi and other places to visit and study, including officials and engineers from the Construction Supervision Department.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But after they came back, the arena they designed and built was very different from the racing arenas in mainland Greece. Just like the Greeks believed that any competitive competition could be watched for free, while the Theonians Money is used to watching games, so the arena is closed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Due to the rushed construction time, it is not as majestic as the main arena of Hades. Its height is only 20 meters and the auditorium has only two floors. However, its length exceeds any arena in the kingdom, reaching more than 500 meters. Its appearance is a long oval, so it can accommodate more than 30,000 spectators.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It was still early, but the entire auditorium was almost full. The noisy arena suddenly erupted into thunderous cheers. It turned out that King Davos and his family appeared in the royal stand.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Like the main arena of Hades, the racing arena also has stands dedicated to the royal family.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But unlike the Hades main arena, it is not built in the auditorium, but on the two-story auditorium, becoming the highest point of the entire arena. This is the engineers' thoughtful consideration for the royal family: Because the track of the venue is too long, only by sitting at a higher place can you have a clear view of the entire stadium.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After waving to the audience, Davos returned to his seat.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kristoya, Dido and the others restrained the children and prohibited them from running around. Although there were railings around to protect them, it was no joke to accidentally fall from a height of more than 20 meters.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
