   Chapter 1291 Battle of Asia Minor (2)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, the predicament of the light infantry in the front also had a certain impact on the Greek coalition soldiers in the rear, but Agesilaus, Ipamelonda, Iphicrates... &#226;&#128;&#166;These very capable generals had the same idea as Leoticides, so they firmly controlled their armies and remained motionless in place.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although there were some minor commotions among the Allied armies in central Italy, they had been attached to the Kingdom of Theonia for more than 10 years. Their long-term close exchanges and military cooperation had made them accustomed to obeying the orders of the commander of Theonia and did not issue an offensive order. They will never attack easily.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, some Greek city-state armies, whether generals or soldiers, began to become restless when they saw the light infantry in front of them falling continuously. Fortunately, Leoticides sent more than 10 messengers to gallop on the entire right wing. From the rear, he shouted his orders and forbade them to attack, and then he barely controlled the entire army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the other hand, after learning that the opponent's cavalry suddenly appeared on its right wing, Pharnabazos was worried that the Greek coalition would let the cavalry raid the Persian archers who were too forward to restore the current disadvantage, so he quickly issued the order to "advance the whole army" The order was to shorten the excessive distance between the main force and the archers and provide support and protection for the archers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Pharnabazos had a good idea, but when the army with an array of seven or eight miles and a strength of 80,000 moved forward, the entire situation was beyond his control.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Some of the Persian generals responsible for leading the cavalry were already impatient with the long confrontation. They ignored Pharnabazos's order to only advance, and instead directly ordered their cavalry to attack the enemy on the opposite side.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Their unauthorized actions naturally attracted other Persian cavalry, so the cavalry at both ends of the Persian military formation quickly increased their speed and galloped towards the two wings of the Greek coalition formation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After receiving the news, Pharnabazus, no matter how angry he was, had to ask the buglers to blow the attack bugle.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leotychides, who was riding a horse and standing on a high ground, saw the Persian army approaching quickly, and also immediately asked the buglers to blow the bugle.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Two trumpets with similar sounds and different rhythms echoed throughout the battlefield, making it easy for soldiers who lacked training to distinguish. However, this was not a problem at all for the Theonia Light Infantry Brigade. After the reminders of the team officers, The soldiers supported their injured comrades and retreated quickly, passing through the gaps in the checkerboard formation and retreating to the rear of the entire military formation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The other coalition light infantry received repeated instructions from their generals before the battle began, "to keep up with the pace of the Theonia light infantry brigade," so they also followed suit.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The retreat of the entire Greek coalition light infantry undoubtedly provided the Persian archers with a good opportunity to attack. However, the Persian archers did not take the opportunity to attack. On the contrary, they retreated earlier than the opponent's light infantry because the Persian infantry formation was relatively dense. If When the Persian infantry troops are behind them, the Persian archers will retreat, which will inevitably lead to some disorder in the formation. And if at this time, the Greek coalition forces who are already very close to each other suddenly launch an attack, then the entire Persian army formation will encounter big trouble.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The archers who finally retreated to the rear of the Persian army followed the infantry array, while the Theonian light infantry group withdrew to the rear of the array, but quickly ran towards the left wing of the entire formation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, there was no cavalry on the left end of the Greek coalition's left wing, but there were three Theonian light armored brigades arranged in a loose formation, perpendicular to the left wing formation to protect the flank.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Epirus light shield soldiers, whose number was less than a thousand, did not follow the light infantry brigade to the left wing. Instead, under the leadership of the Theonian officer, they went to support the cavalry on the right wing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the frontal battlefield, facing the Persian infantry array that was getting closer and closer, the Greek coalition array still stood still. , but the coalition cavalry on the left wing moved.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Persian infantry was still halfway, and the Persian cavalry had already rushed down the hillside.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, the Greek coalition cavalry at the right end of the right wing was arranged in a square formation. The commander of the Thessalian cavalry corps in the central front immediately gave the order to attack. The flag bearer waved the legion flag embroidered with Pegasus, and finally pointed forward with force.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The cavalry clamped the horse's belly and shook the reins vigorously. The horse took four hooves and began to run...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   From top to bottom, the speed increased rapidly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   First came the Thessalian cavalry, followed closely by the Macedonian cavalry, and finally the cavalry from various Greek city-states, gathered into a powerful force, like a rushing mountain torrent, making a deafening noise, roaring towards the Persian cavalry at the foot of the mountain.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Most of the Persian cavalry are light cavalry. Some of them are equipped with javelins and some with bows and arrows. Close combat is not their strong point.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the terrain in Thessaly and Macedonia is relatively flat, the edge areas are mostly hills, and their main opponents are the indigenous people in the surrounding mountains. The war horses gallop on the hills, and the riders cannot maintain a stable posture to throw javelins or shoot arrows. On the contrary, they It was easier to be caught up by the natives, which forced the cavalry to improve their ability to fight in close combat. Therefore, most of the Thessaly and Macedonian cavalry were close combat cavalry.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, not only them, but also the Gallic cavalry and Lusitanian cavalry in the Western Mediterranean. Only the Numibians developed the ability to ride horses, archery and javelin in the flat and vast interior of Africa.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Theonia incorporated the Thessalian cavalry into the legion, he equipped them with a full set of leather armor, 3-meter spears and sabers specially built for the cavalry, which not only enhanced their melee capabilities, but also did not weaken the cavalry on horseback. balance and flexibility.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Persian cavalry originally wanted to use javelins and bows to inflict casualties on the Greek coalition cavalry and infantry after approaching the two wings of the Greek coalition, thereby disrupting the enemy's array.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Their formation was loose and their speed was very fast, but their speed naturally slowed down when going uphill.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But at this moment, the Greek coalition cavalry, which had been stationary, suddenly rushed towards them, as fast as lightning, and rushed to the front in an instant. The Persian cavalry was unable to dodge in time, relying on the greater number of people. The other party bit the bullet and pushed forward.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   If the entire Greek coalition cavalry at this time is a sharp knife that stabs out quickly, the Thessalian cavalry is the sharp blade on this sharp knife. Although the speed makes them feel palpitating, they still stare ahead with wide eyes. Hold the horse's neck tightly with your left hand, and hold the spear tightly with your right hand. The moment you poke the enemy, release your right hand immediately to avoid being pushed off the horse by the strong momentum.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the Thessalian cavalry has undergone countless charge training in the past few years, many people still fell off their horses. Of course, the Persian cavalry fell off their horses even more, and they were either killed or injured.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What's even more frightening is that due to the strong kinetic energy of the charge, the coalition cavalry could not stop the horses at all. They watched helplessly as the horses suddenly hit the Persian cavalry in front, not only knocking them away, but also causing serious injuries to themselves.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The subsequent coalition cavalry quickly passed through the Persian cavalry array, trampling on wounded soldiers and horses everywhere.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The charge of the Greek allied cavalry caused the Persian cavalry to not only stop advancing, but most of them were also crowded together, with horses neighing and people shouting, making it impossible to quickly restore unified command.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Thessalian cavalry who fell off their horses climbed up from the ground, immediately drew the sabers from their waists, and slashed at the surrounding enemies and horses, making the scene even more chaotic.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The coalition cavalry that broke through the enemy's formation quickly circled back and once again launched an attack on the chaotic Persian cavalry...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Persian Army The 4,000 cavalry on the right wing of the formation successfully approached the left wing of the Greek coalition, but the Theonian light armored soldiers guarded its side. Although the arrows and javelins they fired caused some casualties to the light armored soldiers, they did not reach the main purpose of disrupting the army. The purpose of the array.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Subsequently, the light infantry arrived one after another. Their bows and javelins had a longer range and more stable and accurate output. They posed a great threat to the Persian cavalry, forcing them to retreat to a farther distance, thereby easing the pressure on the light infantry. The pressure of soldiers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, the soldiers of the Persian army had stepped onto the gentle slope one after another and began to move upward.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the winding Persian army formation was about five or sixty meters away from the main force of the Greek coalition, and the Persian archers behind it began to bend their bows and arrows, the Theonian soldiers in the center and left wing of the Greek coalition suddenly stepped forward neatly. He took a big step and threw the javelin in his hand violently.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the light infantry was at a disadvantage in the fierce battle with the Persian archers, the legionnaires did not step forward to help their comrades under the strict orders of the team officers. They were waiting for this moment.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Persian army did not know much about the tactics of the Theonian Army. Although Jason had heard about it before, he had not fought with the Theonian Army after all. In addition, the previous soldiers of the Theonian Army Their silence made the Persian infantry and Greek mercenaries relax their vigilance. As a result, when the javelins that covered the sky came, they hurriedly defended and it was already too late.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Because the Theonian soldiers were located at a high place, the javelins thrown were more damaging. After one round, they fell to pieces, either dead or injured.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the Persian army was still in shock, another round of javelin followed, like a strong wind blowing, and the front of the center and right wing of the Persian army suddenly became fragmented.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Woo!...Woo!..." At this moment, the attack bugle of the Greek coalition sounded.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Whether it was the Theonian soldiers, the Greek soldiers, or the Italian allied soldiers, they all roared in unison and launched charges one after another. The six or seven-mile-long military formation poured down like a mountain and the sea, with an astonishing momentum.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Persian archers pulled the bow strings desperately, hoping to let the arrows cover the sky to weaken the enemy's charge, but most of the arrows fell on the heavily armored heavy infantry, basically causing no damage, so when both sides When the military formations collided head-on, it almost presented a one-sided situation. The left, center, and right sides of the Persian military formation were all struggling to cope with the enemy's attack. Under strong pressure, the entire military formation was forced to slow down. Slowly retreat...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
