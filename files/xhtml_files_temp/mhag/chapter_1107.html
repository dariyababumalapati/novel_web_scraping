   Chapter 1107 North African Elephant&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Okriton was not surprised after hearing this. According to the information he learned, the Etruscan Alliance has suffered from the invasion of the Gauls from the north in recent years and had to rely on Theonia. Last year, Theonia specially sent troops to station at the northern border of the Iberian Union to ensure the security of its territory. Of course, the Etruscans had to express their feelings for this, which is not surprising. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What about the ships in front of them? Are they all Etruscans?" Okriton asked with interest as he looked at a large cargo ship with a relatively high side and a first floor among the ships in front.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I just made a special observation when I passed those ships in a small boat. Although most of their sailors are...Phoenicians, it seems..." The attendant hesitated and said with anger: "The clothes of the people on the boats are... Like the Numibians and the Mauretanians!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   No matter how self-restrained Occleton was, it was still difficult to remain calm at this moment, because the Carthaginians attributed half of the failure of that war to the rebellion of the Numibians. , and after that, the Numibians who were once slaves, in turn, frequently invaded the land of the Carthaginians, so whether it was in the past or now, the Numibians are a pain in the hearts of the Carthaginians.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Okriton quickly calmed down and asked in a deep voice: "Why did they come with so many ships?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It seems that many ships carried horses." The attendant replied.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Okri suddenly understood: "The Numibians only have so little to offer."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Sir." The attendant whispered hesitantly: "They all give gifts to Theonia, but we have nothing. Take, is this..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Okriton raised his head: "We Carthage can send envoys to attend the celebration. This is the best gift for the Hades celebration in Theonia!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Okriton Having said that, he knew clearly: Carthage's status in the Western Mediterranean was no longer what it used to be, but many Carthage elders had not fully adapted to this new change, including Hanno, so in other envoys The regiments all brought generous gifts, but the Carthage envoys seemed shabby in comparison, which undoubtedly made the subsequent negotiations with Theonia more difficult.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While Okriton was thinking deeply, the Etrunian envoys had unloaded their belongings and left the dock. Next, it was the turn of the ships of the Numibian envoys and the Mauritanian envoys to enter the inner city dock.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a while, I heard horses neighing and people barking, and the pier became extremely lively.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Suddenly, a deafening exclamation came from the shore, and it lasted for a long time. Even Okriton outside the port could hear it clearly: "Oh my God, what kind of monster is this?! It's so huge!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is possible ...Maybe it's the giant bull of Lucania..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Idiot! Does a cow have such a long nose? And the horns of a cow grow on its head, but its horns grow on its mouth." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then tell me, What is it?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I have never seen it before, how can I know, but we can ask these Mauritanians."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hearing these exclamations, Okriton was surprised: Could it be that Mauritanians will live in Africa? Are the elephants from the interior sent to Thurii?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although he has never seen it, he has heard that there are many elephants further south in the territories of West Numibians and Mauretanians. Most of the ivory sold in the market in Carthage comes from there.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, ivory is also a very popular item in Thurii, especially when a large amount of it was purchased when the Temple of Hades was renovated. However, when the real owner of the ivory walked out of the cabin and came to the shore, he was still shocked. The people who came to watch: "There are such giant beasts in this world! Could this be the descendant of a certain monster in ancient times?!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Compared to the people who were shouting and thinking wildly, they came to greet them. The Turiyi officials of the envoy group were shocked and even more worried about how much damage these giant beasts would cause to the city when they went crazy, because it seemed that they would be difficult to control, knowing that the people in the inner city Whether they are elders, important ministers, or ordinary citizens, their status is extraordinary. If a large number of casualties are caused, they, small foreign ministry officials, cannot bear this responsibility.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even though the Mauritanian envoy repeatedly explained to the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: This animal looks huge, but it is actually gentle and will not hurt people easily.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, the mahout was also asked to command the elephant, kneel down to the officials, and use its long trunk to make various funny movements such as waving and nodding. This did not completely dispel the officials' doubts, but it made the cheers of the people on the side even more enthusiastic. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Fortunately, not long after, hundreds of palace guards arrived. On the order of King Davos, they took these elephants to the elephant enclosure specially built for elephants on the Hill of Kings.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So, under the careful command of the mahouts, the three elephants, a male, a female, and a cub, took slow and heavy steps, stepping on the flat and solid street roads, along the route of the triumphant army. The route we went through was heading to the west of the city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After receiving the news, the people in the inner city walked out of their homes one after another, including some elders, standing on the roadside, curiously watching this giant beast that they had never seen before.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   With the efforts of the palace guards to maintain order, the excited people did not cause the elephants to panic. Instead, they enjoyed the rare honor of being a victorious soldier, which also made the people look forward to this year's celebration even more.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   By the time the Carthage envoy's boat entered the dock, it was already afternoon. Okriton had been waiting on the boat for nearly 4 hours, so as soon as he landed, he looked angrily at the Theonian officials who came to greet him. Complained: "Thurii is such a big city, but it has such a small port, so that any visiting foreign envoys will not feel the momentum of Theonia as the most powerful country in the Western Mediterranean, but it will be a cowardly one." You're so stingy!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Theonian official was not angry because of Okriton's outspoken offense. Instead, he admitted frankly: "You are right. We also found that this is a big problem. This inner city river port was established in the kingdom. It was built before. At that time, its capacity was sufficient for use. However, foreign envoys have visited too frequently in recent years, and many envoys have not come empty-handed-"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As he said this, he looked at Okriton intentionally or unintentionally. The lonely passenger ship behind him: "So this river port is no longer enough for use. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has reported this issue to His Majesty. Although both sides of the inner city are now occupied by buildings, there is no spare space to build a new river port. , but His Majesty has convened several ministerial administrative meetings on this issue, and I believe that a solution will be found soon."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Okridun nodded and expressed his understanding. In fact, he just wanted to vent his grievances. He didn't care whether the Turiyi river port problem was solved or not. He changed the topic and asked seriously: "I request to see Dai. King Vos, on behalf of the Carthage Senate, we have important matters to discuss with him. You...um...can the Ministry of Foreign Affairs convey my request to King Davos?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The official looked at him seriously. said: "According to the administrative regulations of the kingdom, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible for all foreign affairs. If you have any requirements, you can first write a letter and submit it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Our chief, Mr. Ansitanos, will After reading it, judge whether it is important, and then decide whether to leave it to us for discussion or to leave it to His Majesty for decision...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, there have been many envoys visiting in the past few days, and they all have their demands. I heard that in the office of Lord Ansitanos There are already piles of letters from him, and he usually has to go to Theonia Academy to attend classes, so he is almost overwhelmed. Even if you submit the letter, I am afraid it will take some time before I can reply to you."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Russia Creighton was dumbfounded. His past negotiations with Theonia were all during the war. He went directly to the military camp to meet King Davos. He never expected to meet Dai Vos in Turiyi. King Firth's situation turned out to be so complicated and difficult, so he didn't know how to respond for a while.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing his silence, the official suddenly said, "Actually, there is another way to better solve your problem."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What is it?" Okriton asked immediately.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "During this period, His Majesty saw that there were many foreign affairs affairs during the celebration, and he was worried that Lord Ansitanos would be too busy, so he specially arranged a rotating chairman of the Senate the day before yesterday to assist him in temporarily managing foreign affairs. You can go to him directly, maybe He will take you to meet His Majesty."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Go to him directly? No need to submit a letter first and then obtain his consent?" Okriton was a little confused.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Other messengers may not be able to do it, but you may be able to because you are a Carthage." The official said with a meaningful smile.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Okriton's heart moved, and he asked in a trembling voice: "What is the name of this... rotating chairman?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Haka."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sure enough!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ... Okriton smiled bitterly, feeling as if a five-flavor bottle had been knocked over in his heart, and he couldn't tell what it was like.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Early in the morning, at King Davos's mansion, after Davos finished his morning exercises, he walked into the dining room, only to find that there were only Crystal and Agnes in the dining room. The two of them asked: "Where are the children?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "They hurriedly finished their breakfast and went to see the elephants. Eunice and Briantes have always loved to join in the fun, but this is the first time I have seen the always calm Apox is acting so eager too," Crystal complained.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "As long as the children are happy, it means that my decision to bring these elephants to the mountain was correct." Davos said and sat down at the dining table.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agnes immediately brought him a bowl of hot wheat porridge, and said with a smile: "Last night Aviya took me to see the elephants. When she came back, she was very excited and insisted on sleeping with me. I talked excitedly for a long time, and this is the first time I have seen her say so many words.&#13;
