   Chapter 1108 Haka meets Okriton&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "To be honest, the gods' creations are indeed very wonderful! Look at the two elephants who are so huge and mighty, but they have very docile personalities, especially the little elephant with her little trunk I grabbed the female elephant's tail and refused to let go. The female elephant never got angry. Instead, she kept sucking the leaves with her trunk and feeding them to the baby... This reminded me of Aviya when I was a child. She was not Just like that, always close to me, afraid that I will leave her..." Agnes said, sighing with a smile.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked at Agnes, who rarely became so active, and said with a smile: "I see you, you seem to be obsessed with these elephants too!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Isn't that right!" Christoya finally found it Knowing her close friend, she complained loudly: "Just now Agnes told me that she would not go to the Temple of Hera today and would spend the day watching elephants at home, and she asked me to accompany her! Tell me, we are almost 50 How can a person who is 20 years old act like a child! Besides, I am so busy now, how can I have free time to watch elephants..." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I see, today we have put aside other things and spent time with the children. Go see the elephants and enjoy the joy of being together as a family!" Davos suggested loudly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay!" Agnes smiled brightly and immediately clapped her hands in agreement.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kristoya frowned slightly, and just about to object, Davos gently pressed her hand and said softly: "You, you are busy every day, let yourself relax today."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos The concerned look made Crystal soften: "Okay, today we will stay at home with the children and not go anywhere. But... it is not a good idea to place the elephant next to the mansion. That guy Although they look docile, they are so big after all. If they go crazy one day, they will pose a danger to us!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And... this elephant is a rare animal that the people of the kingdom have never seen before. It arrived yesterday After coming up the mountain, many people wanted to come in and watch, including some elders. This morning, the children also asked their friends to pass the checkpoint and go up the mountain to watch the elephants... In the long run, it will be difficult to achieve safety here. Guarantee!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I have already considered this matter." Davos said calmly: "Krystoya, we will have another business next." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What is it? ?!" Christoya immediately became energetic.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Build a zoo."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Zoo?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "We have heard the story of Hercules strangling the Nemean lion since we were children, but have you ever seen a real lion?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kristoya and her sisters shook their heads. Shaking his head (Actually, in this era, there were still lion habitats in the interior of Asia Minor and Mesopotamia, but Miletus was a seaside city-state, and Greek women were not allowed to travel far, so Christoya had no chance to see it) .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "We have heard the story of Apollo shooting a python to death. You may have seen snakes, but have you seen a real python?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The two shook their heads again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "We have all heard that there are hippos and crocodiles in the Nile River in Egypt, but what do hippos and crocodiles really look like? I'm afraid not many Theonians have actually seen it." Davos tapped his fingers on the dining table and said confidently : "So why don't we build a zoo?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   If you keep these weird and exotic animals in this zoo, let them live in a fixed area of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;the park, and create a suitable living environment for them, do you think people will come to watch it?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course there will be! "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agnes immediately replied: "Just one elephant makes the people so crazy. When I came back yesterday, I heard the captain of the palace guard down the mountain complaining that the people wanted to force their way in to see the elephant. Almost had a conflict with them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Krystoya has been in business for many years and immediately understood the meaning of Davos' words. She asked uncertainly: "You mean, it's like charging people to watch the games when rugby and football games are held in the arena. Are the tickets the same?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   That's right. "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos secretly praised his wife's quick thinking and continued to explain: "After all, it costs money to raise these animals, and a large number of people need to be hired to maintain the entire zoo...The money collected through tickets can just make up for these expenses."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As for where the rare animals in the zoo come from?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   We don't have to worry at all. Those city-states and forces that have good relations with Theonia and want to have good relations with Theonia will take the initiative to send them to me after learning that I have built a zoo and collected rare animals. , in order to strengthen our friendship with me...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As the territory of the kingdom expands, our zoo will only get bigger and bigger, raising more and more rare animals.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   By then, Tulii can not only eat delicious food, watch games, soak in hot springs, and enjoy celebrations... but also visit the zoo. Ordinary people, school students, and academy scholars can learn about it without risking their travels. And studying most of the rare animals in the world is a very lucky thing!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, it also lets them know how great God is. He not only created us humans, but also created so many wonderful animals. We are not alone..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos talked about the prospects of the zoo, but in his heart It was filled with emotion: When he learned from Ansitanos that the Mauritanian envoys had sent several elephants, his first reaction at the time was - these must be the legendary North African elephants and African elephants in his previous life. A branch of the elephant! Pyrrhus used it to defeat the Roman army several times, and Hannibal also incorporated it into the army to pose a threat to the Romans. But unfortunately, it became extinct in the Roman era. It was not Because of the war, but because of the gladiatorial games that the Romans were passionate about. The Romans captured all kinds of beasts from all over the Mediterranean, and then transported them to the Colosseum and let the gladiators kill them, thereby making money and allowing the audience to Exciting...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos read an article in his previous life. A Roman emperor held a grand gladiatorial match to please the people of Rome. During the entire gladiatorial match, thousands of various beasts were killed. In the Romans' In the ongoing killings, not to mention North African elephants, no lions, leopards and other beasts can be seen in the entire Mediterranean region. If it were not for the terrifying Sahara Desert, which is difficult to cross, allowing animals south of the desert to survive, I am afraid that modern humans in previous lives would not be able to survive. We can only learn about wild beasts such as African elephants and lions in literature.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It can be said that Westerners in previous lives have pursued a crazy way of plundering nature since ancient times. In this life, Davos wants to change them , then let's start from the zoo to cultivate children's good habits of getting close to animals.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Okriton asked the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Theonia to tell them what they wanted to interview. Seeing that King Davos's request was submitted, but there was no news for two days in a row, and seeing that the celebration was about to begin, he felt anxious and had to choose to follow another idea given by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs official.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During the celebration, not only many foreign envoys and distinguished guests come to Turiyi, but also the chief executives and important officials of various towns will try their best to spare time and rush back to participate.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, visits to the kingdom's important ministers will become more frequent. Generally speaking, the residences of the five rotating presidents and ministers will become crowded.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It stands to reason that Haka's mansion would be even more like this, because since their brothers came to Thurii last year, Hasdrubal directly became the commander of the army and soon went north to take office, while Haka became the official rotating chairman of the Senate. , although he was still recovering from illness, Davos could not wait to start letting him take charge of some government affairs in order to familiarize himself with the operation of the kingdom's political system as soon as possible. In addition, Dido, another important member of the Magonid family, became the prince and concubine, and gave birth to a child. Two little princes were born... The Magonid family is very popular in the kingdom's political arena. It can be imagined that the kingdom officials who came to visit them should be like crucian carp crossing the river, but the actual situation is that there are only a few families.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Because Haka once publicly declared: "He himself is weak and sick and needs to rest, so officials are not welcome to visit his home."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Moreover, Helps also endorsed him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At first, the officials of the kingdom were still doubtful. After several Phoenician senators came to visit and were rejected, they finally confirmed that what Haka said was true.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Okriton arrived in Turiyi, he deliberately learned about this situation. Coupled with the years of grievances between the Magonid family and the Hanno faction, he has been hesitant, but now there is no way, he can only be brave. I came to visit, but I didn't expect that I got permission.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, the former Carthaginian nobleman and today's important minister of the Kingdom of Theonia had a very special way of receiving guests from his hometown - taking a bath.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The bathhouse was invented by the Theonians, but it was quickly introduced to Carthage after the two countries signed the earliest peace agreement more than ten years ago. The Germe Hot Spring Bathhouse is a favorite place for Carthage people, and of course it is now It already belongs to the Kingdom of Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Okriton felt strange about this request, it was already an unexpected surprise that Haka was willing to see him, so he dared to refuse.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka's bathroom was built strictly in accordance with the traditional Theonia bathroom pattern. By the time Okriton completed the previous procedures and walked into the heated pool, Haka was already sitting in the pool.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Okriton had not seen Haka before, but he had long heard that the head of the Magonid family, Himilko, had a second son who was very smart since he was a child. Unfortunately, he was born with diseases, and he had seen a doctor. The doctor diagnosed that the child would not live to be 20 years old.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But now Haka in front of Okriton, although his body is slightly thin, his face is rosy and his eyes are bright, and he does not look like a person who is about to enter the grave.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka looked at him and said in a calm tone: "After I came to Turiyi, Dr. Theonia suggested that people like me who cannot do strenuous exercise should take more baths, which is good for health. I obeyed I was advised to take a bath every day. I happened to be taking a bath when you came, so I invited you to meet me here."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
