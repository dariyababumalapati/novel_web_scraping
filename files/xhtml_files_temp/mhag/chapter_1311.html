   Chapter 1311: Battle of Taposakus (3)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos perked up and immediately asked: "Great! Where are they?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Felicius handed the board over knowingly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Izam gasped, took the wooden board, carefully looked at the diagram of the Persian military formation drawn on it, then pointed to the center front row of its right wing, and said excitedly: "It's right here! Remy made the agreement before I left. The secret code asked the people to use the copper shields equipped by the Persians to swing up and down regularly against the sun, so that they were clearly different from other Persian armies. Even if I stand here, I can see clearly. I think back then When we captured the city of Asprostum, our mountain reconnaissance brigade also used a similar method -"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Very good! You have done a great job!" Davos interrupted his ramblings and then asked: "We Which troops are they opposing?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The third and fourth battalions of the Eleventh Legion." Izam replied immediately.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, you can send the 18th Army Corps as a reserve, so that when Brother Yizam's troops retreat, you can make full use of this opportunity to increase the attack on this section of the Persian army!" Feili! Hughes also suggested excitedly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "One legion is not enough!" Davos shook his head, lit the board hard, and said resolutely: "Send the 19th legion there as well. This will be the breakthrough point for our infantry!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166; &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just as the two legions of Theonia were quietly mobilizing behind the array, Mardonius had already rushed to the carriage of the King of Persia on horseback. , said anxiously: "Your Majesty, all the troops have been arrayed, why haven't you given the order to attack?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Artaxerxes said hesitantly: "...Should we wait for the Theonians to attack first? "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Theonia has few soldiers and it is impossible to attack us first!" Mardonius endured the dissatisfaction in his heart, turned to look at Trebasus not far away, and vented his anger on him: "Aren't you the most resourceful minister in the kingdom? How did you advise the king on military affairs? Since the attack plan was formulated before the war, you should assist the king in executing it! It has been almost half an hour since the army was arrayed, and the soldiers are still stupid Stand and wait, do you know that when I came here from the left wing, I saw that many affiliated troops were already a little unstable, and even the formation of the Eastern Uxians began to appear chaotic!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Trebasus maintained Silent and without refutation, he had urged the King of Persia several times before, but the King of Persia seemed to have some concerns and never made a decision, so he delayed again and again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Artaxerxes' expression changed. Of course he could hear that Mardonius was criticizing him, but he couldn't get angry and reprimand him on the spot. On the one hand, he was facing a powerful enemy, which would affect his morale, and on the other hand, he felt guilty.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before the war, he did formulate offensive-focused tactics after repeated discussions with several important ministers. However, when he saw the concise and quick formation of the Theonian army on the opposite side, the soldiers in the array stood silently, as calm as a mountain. Compared with the disorganized and noisy army of his own, he suddenly felt a strong uneasiness in his heart. Several failures in the past came to mind, which inevitably made him worry about gains and losses again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But when he heard what Mardonios said later, he was startled.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Trebassus, who was good at observing people's words, immediately said: "Your Majesty, those auxiliary troops are not our well-trained Persian army. Although they have been strictly trained during this period, it is difficult for them to maintain their formation for a long time. We We must launch an attack as soon as possible!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Artaxerxes looked at Trebassus and then at Mardonius: "Then give the order to attack?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mardonius said anxiously: "Your Majesty, don't hesitate. , hurry up and give the order!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Artaxerxes clenched the armrests of the carriage tightly, and glanced at the majestic undead army in front, the Greek mercenaries like iron walls, huge war elephants, terrifying murderous weapons chariots, well-trained The archers of Su... finally looked at the silent Theonian army on the opposite side. After a moment of silence, he took a deep breath and said loudly: "Get ready to attack!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mardonius looked happy and turned his horse to run back.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Trebassus then shouted: "Prepare to attack! Prepare to attack!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Woo... Wu..." While the Persian bugle sounded, Trebassus continued to issue orders for the King of Persia. : "Archers attack!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A flag embroidered with bows and arrows was raised high in front of Artaxerxes' carriage, but the only people who could see the flag waving were the archers in the center of the middle road. For more than ten miles, not to mention seeing the flag raised, even the soldiers at both ends of the wings may not be able to hear the bugle blowing, but the Persian army has its own methods.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Two teams of Persian messengers in bright military uniforms galloped out from both sides of the carriage, passed through the gap between the teams, rushed to the front, and then ran wildly along the military formation to both sides while shouting: "Archers attack! Archers attack!" Attack!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The bow and arrow in the middle moved!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The bows and arrows on the left wing were activated!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The bow and arrow on the right wing were activated!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The archers, who were at the forefront of the Persian military formation and lined up in a loose formation for more than ten miles, were like a long snake that had just woken up from hibernation and began to slowly advance towards the Theonian military formation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as he heard the bugle sound coming from the opposite side, Alsinis immediately perked up like other team officers and shouted to his soldiers: "Attention, brothers, the Persians are about to attack!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While shouting, Seeing that some soldiers in the detachment were overly excited and eager to try, he immediately reminded: "Everyone must strictly follow the pre-war arrangements and be prepared for defense! Anyone who dares to violate military orders will be severely punished!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The soldiers' hearts trembled, and their expressions became solemn.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Captain, the Persian archers are coming!" the soldiers in the first column shouted.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Prepare to defend!" Alsinis' heart tightened and he stared ahead.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Persian archers advanced very slowly, because the Persian generals who led the army knew the details of the battle in Asia Minor and knew that the Theonian army also had a large number of light infantry with strong combat effectiveness, so they were careful Be prepared for the appearance of opponents.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, they were less than 250 meters away from the Theonian army formation, and the opponent's light infantry still did not appear in front of the formation. Although the generals were confused, they did not stop the soldiers from advancing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When approaching a hundred meters from the Theonian army, the archers consciously stopped advancing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Fire the arrow!" Amid the shouts of the generals, the archers nocked their arrows and raised their bows high at a high angle of elevation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!..." Thousands of the originally light sound of bowstrings gathered together, and it could be heard extremely clearly by the Theonian soldiers a hundred meters away.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Turtle shell formation!" Alsinis shouted.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The soldiers who were originally lined up in a dense formation quickly retracted inward, and at the same time blocked the outside and top of the small square formation with their long shields. In the blink of an eye, it was as if a layer of black iron was added to the 50-man team. , protect them tightly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alsinis, who was in the middle of the phalanx, looked up through the small gap between the long shields, and saw the sky-blocking arrows pouring down like a torrential rain. Even with the protection of the thick long shields, He couldn't help but feel his heart tightening.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Peng! Peng! Dang! Dang! Peng!..." The arrows continued to hit different parts of the long shield, making different sounds, as if they were playing a melody of death.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Theonian soldiers in the turtle shell formation all looked nervous, but when the melody disappeared, no one was injured.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before they could take a breath, the melody sounded again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After three or four repetitions, there was finally a long pause.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is because the generals of the Persian archer mixed force discovered that the front lines of the Theonian army had adopted this strange formation, so that their projectiles caused almost no damage, so they urged the soldiers to continue moving forward, using closer missiles. distance to increase the penetration of arrows.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Approaching to a distance of 50 meters, the Persian archers did not dare to move forward because they had heard that the heavy infantry of Theonia could project javelins and were too close to the enemy. When they shot arrows, the Theonia on the opposite side The soldiers suddenly charged and they could not escape.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It is precisely because of this danger that not all archers are willing to continue to approach the Theonian army. Some archers of other races are still shrinking even if the Persian generals urge them repeatedly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The front-line soldiers of the Persian archery troops used direct fire, and the rear-line soldiers used projectiles, and they shot more concentratedly at each turtle shell formation, rather than a large-scale attack, which resulted in inefficiency, because Theonia's checkerboard array made the entire army The formation was relatively scattered, causing many of the thrown arrows to land in the open space.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   More dense sounds resounded outside the tortoise-shell array formed by Alsinis' detachment, like heavy rain hitting lotus leaves. Each long shield was studded with arrows like a hedgehog, and the soldiers also let out painful groans from time to time. , the sharp arrow tip penetrated the shield and touched the exposed arms or thighs of the Theonian soldiers. Occasionally, arrows passed through the gaps in the shield formation, and because they were blocked by thick helmets and breastplates, Didn't cause much damage.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Theonian soldiers gritted their teeth motionlessly and persisted. Of course, they were almost shoulder to shoulder, back to chest, and even if they were injured, they could not dodge or retreat.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As the squad leader, Alsinis not only has to peek at the enemy's movements in front from time to time, but also listens to the frequency of arrows hitting the long shield.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Suddenly, he said in a deep voice: "Brothers, if you hold on a little longer, the Persians will not have many arrows left!" As soon as&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   he finished speaking, the sounds outside the array began to become sparse and disappeared soon after.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Persian archers still had three or four arrows in their quivers, but they chose to retreat at this time. On the one hand, their arms were sore and they needed to rest due to the continuous drawing of the bow. This is a traditional Persian tactic to provide support for the infantry in close combat. Of course, all the arrows cannot be consumed at this time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;

 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thanks, sorry, I want all the rewards!&#13;
