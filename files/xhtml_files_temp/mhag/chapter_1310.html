   Chapter 1310 The Battle of Taposakus (2)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   More than half an hour later, almost all the Theonian troops completed their formation. Quietness soon returned to this side, while the Persian side was still noisy. noisy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Two days ago, Artaxerxes became more confident in winning this battle after listening to Tribasus's account of the situation in the Theonian camp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now that he is sitting high on the carriage, he can see the situation on the opposite side clearly. The rapid and efficient formation of the Theonian army is too obvious compared with the chaos and procrastination of his own side, which makes him feel a little uneasy again, and the sight is beyond his reach. The place was completely black, and the uniform pressure was heart-stopping, causing him to shout involuntarily: "Trebasus, urge the troops to speed up the formation! Speed &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;up the formation!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, Your Majesty!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the Theonian army was in formation, the sun was almost rising to the middle of the sky, and the soldiers received orders from the team officers one after another: "Hurry up and add some food."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The soldiers of the first detachment of the second brigade of the first legion When they were chewing the bread they carried and passing water bags to each other, someone exclaimed: "Captain, look! The Persians really have elephants!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alsinis, who was standing behind the squad and serving the soldiers, heard this and immediately Walking to the front of the queue, looking forward, I saw dozens of elephants in the Persian army on the opposite side wearing hoodies, long tusks and swords tied to them. Under the command of the mahout, they were slowly walking to the end of the Persian array. ahead.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The elephants were huge and particularly eye-catching compared to the troops around them. Their appearance immediately caused a commotion among the soldiers of the First Legion and the surrounding legions.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alsinis took a deep breath, turned around and shouted loudly to the soldiers who were talking about it: "The commander of the Martonis Army has told us before that there may be war elephants in the Persian army. What are you surprised about! "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Captain, we are just curious, the Persians actually sent such a docile animal to the battlefield!" a soldier responded.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "No matter how docile an animal is, it can be scary once it goes crazy. Don't take it lightly!" Alsinis warned, and then smiled: "But the Persians don't know that we have seen giant animals countless times at the Thurii Zoo. They think they can scare us with it, and then we will in turn make the Persians suffer from abusing elephants!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Captain, don't worry, we are not afraid of elephants, we just think elephants are so cute. It would be a pity if they all died in this battle." Another soldier said half-jokingly, half-seriously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Another soldier immediately answered: "I don't feel sorry. It's not our fault that these elephants died in the battle. On the contrary, it would be great if we could taste the elephant's meat after the war!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Cripps, you are such a foodie. You have eaten so much delicious food these days and you are still not satisfied! Do you think you can become as strong as an elephant by eating elephant meat?" Arcinis scolded with a smile.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Captain, he just feels that the thing underneath him is too small and wants to be bigger." A soldier said loudly and jokingly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The soldiers burst into laughter.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   More than an hour later, the Persian army finally formed its formation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the forefront of the center are Persian archers in a loose formation, followed by Indian war elephants and sickle chariots lined up in a row. The war elephants are in the center and the chariots are on both sides. Behind them are 3,000 Persian armored cavalry. Behind the cavalry, 20,000 Greek heavy infantry and 10,000 undead troops spread out in a straight line.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Artaxerxes was in the rear, and behind him were ethnic troops from Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf coast.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the forefront of the right wing are Persian archers and a mixed force of archers from Armenia, Parthia, and Media, followed by 100 chariots from Media and Babylon, and behind the chariots are Ducia, Amelia, Persian infantry, followed by teams from tribes around the Caspian Sea, such as the Syrkarians, Tapulians, etc.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the far right end of the right wing were more than 10,000 cavalry from Amelia, Parthia, and Media.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the forefront of the left wing was a mixed force of Persian, Arab, Bactrian, and Arachosian archers, followed by infantry composed of Persian, Carian, and Eastern Uxians and Sitacanis east of Susa. Then came the Far Eastern ethnic troops headed by Arachosia and Bactria.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the far left of the left wing are more than 10,000 cavalry led by Persia, Scythia, and Bactria, with 500 Arab camel cavalry at the forefront.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It can be seen from the Persian formation that the Persian formation has a thick depth, with the strongest force in the middle.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The reason why the Persians made such an arrangement was that the Theonian army had a large number of heavy infantry and strong close combat capabilities, so they increased the depth to enhance the stalemate capability in close combat.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Whether it is for safety reasons or to eliminate the fear of Artaxerxes (In the battle with Cyrus the Younger, Artaxerxes suffered psychological damage from the javelin of Cyrus the Younger). Strength must be strengthened.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, Larrabassus took the opportunity to make a suggestion: hoard heavy troops in the middle, use war elephants and chariots to tear apart the enemy's defense line on the opposite side, and then use armored cavalry to attack, completely disrupting the enemy's heavy infantry. The Greek heavy infantry and the undead army would then follow up the charge. , completely defeated the enemy army, and thus won the battle...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Artaxerxes finally adopted his suggestion.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The formation adopted by the Theonian army is:&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   the first legion, the fourth legion, the seventh legion, the twelfth legion and the fifteenth legion are spread out in a checkerboard formation in the middle. When combined, the thickness is 10 columns. There are 5 light infantry brigades in the center of the rear, and the commander of the entire center is Matonis.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The left wing consists of the Second Army, the Fifth Army, the Eighth Army, the Fourteenth Army, and the Sixteenth Army in a checkerboard formation. When combined, it is 10 columns thick, with no other troops behind; the&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   leftmost end of the left wing is formed by the First Cavalry. It consists of the Legion, the 3rd Cavalry Legion, the Gallic Cavalry Legion and 2,000 Numibian light cavalry, with nine light armored brigades at the rear.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the rear were 6 light infantry brigades and 2,000 Balearic slingers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The right wing consists of the Third Army, the Sixth Army, the Eleventh Army, the Thirteenth Army, and the Seventeenth Army in a checkerboard formation. The combined thickness is 10 columns, and there are no other troops in the rear.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The rightmost front line of the right wing consists of the Second Cavalry Corps, the Fourth Cavalry Corps, the Iberian Cavalry Corps and 2,000 Numibian light cavalry. The rear is also composed of nine light armored brigades.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the rear were 6 light infantry brigades and 2,000 Balearic slingers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The command center where King Davos is located is located behind the center. In addition to the escort of the palace guard, there are also the 18th Legion, the 19th Legion, and the 21st Legion on its left and right as reserves.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   From the formation of the Theonian army, it can be seen that Theonia concentrated heavy troops at both ends of the two wings. It was obvious that he wanted to defeat the Persian cavalry first, and then outflank the two wings.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Persian cavalry is obviously stronger than Theonia, and Davos actually wants to start from the enemy's strongest point. It can be said that he knows that there are tigers in the mountains and prefers to go to the tiger mountains.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the Persian army was twice as large as the Theonian army, due to the caution of the Persian King Artaxerxes, the depth of the array was significantly increased, while the Theonian army had an infantry array due to the confidence of King Davos. The thickness of only 10 columns was maintained, so the lengths of the formations on both sides were almost the same, both 15 miles long.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Persian army has complex sources of arms. Not only do they have different clothing and weapons, but the soldiers themselves are also very different. Therefore, even though most of the entire formation is a dense array and is standing on a flat battlefield, the experienced Theonian The sub-reconnaissance cavalry can still roughly judge the arrangement of troops in the middle and front of the Persian formation through careful observation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Theonian army is almost all black helmets and black armor, and the troops are relatively simple. Moreover, Davos deliberately prevents the enemy from seeing the reality of the array. Therefore, the heavy infantry and cavalry at the front of the formation are arrayed and can cover the enemy on the opposite side. After the line of sight was reached, the rear troops began to be deployed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, Davos also specifically ordered that the soldiers behind the array must not raise their weapons before the battle!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, Felixius and his staff had drawn a sketch of the distribution of troops in the front of the entire Persian formation based on the reports of the scouts.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos took the wooden board he handed over, and after carefully reading the sketch on it, he was slightly surprised: "Hey, the Persians have 100 more chariots, which is somewhat different from the number Izam told us." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maybe. I just arrived recently." Felicius explained.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos thought for a while and quickly made a decision: "Then let...the light infantry group on the right wing first detach 2,000 people to deal with these tanks."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, Your Majesty." Felicius immediately went to convey the message Order.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, it's already past noon, let's eat something first." Henipolis reminded from the side.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I'm not hungry yet." Henipolis had asked several times, so Davos waved his hand impatiently.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the messengers set off, he kept looking to the left with concern, even though it was impossible from his position to see the mobilization of troops several miles away.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a while, he suddenly realized something and asked: "Have Hieronymus and Amyntas eaten?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before Henepolis could answer, Hieronymus's voice came from behind. : "Your Majesty, we are old and we are not participating in the battle. It doesn't matter whether we have lunch or not -" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Yes, Your Majesty, we have no time to eat now. We are just waiting for the battle to begin!" Amyntas was impatient. 's interjected.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Don't worry." Davos said calmly: "The longer time is delayed, the worse it will be for the Persians..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As he was talking, Yizam galloped over from the left on horseback and shouted loudly Said: "Your Majesty, I have found the position of the soldiers of the Xokant tribe in the Persian army!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thanks to Lamperuki and the distant place for the reward!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
