   Chapter 921 Surrender&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After receiving the praise from his father, Crotokatax showed a happy smile.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It's just that-" Davos paused and said gently: "I used to say that you were too gentle in your actions, but this time it was a little more intense. Segovani, the leader of Kautini, has been arrested. We captured him and had his head chopped off to appease the Naconians and Campanians, but to punish the great chief Penteney and the chiefs of both tribes would certainly please the people, but In fact, it may lead to dissatisfaction among the people of the two tribes and prevent the Samnite War from ending soon. This is not what we want.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   You have to know that the tradition of the Samonite people is to respect the strong. Chief Pentney lost the battle with these tribal leaders and lost their land. They will lose their prestige and appeal among their people. We forgive them. , supporting them to continue to serve as tribal leaders will not only gain their gratitude, but will also be more conducive to our control of the Samnites. We can add an article to the covenant, &#226;&#128;&#152;The chiefs of each Samnite tribe must be confirmed by the kingdom before they can formally exercise power in the tribe.' This will establish the authority of the Kingdom among the Samnite tribes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, you proposed that the new chief of Cavutini should be selected from the Naconian tribe, which is very good! I think the young leader of Naconia who first rose up against the Kautini in the battle of Lola can be called..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, your name is Vasonke. He is the second largest tribe in Nakonia, Afangum. He was just elected as the leader of the tribe because his father was killed by Segovani. However, he seems to be too young. He's a little older, only 20 years old." Tormid reminded him while briefly introducing this person's situation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It doesn't matter if you are young, as long as he trusts Theonia, then Theonia will support him, and he can become the big leader!" Davos said proudly&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty is right! In the future, the Samnite tribe will not be able to survive in the mountains without the support of the kingdom!" Henipolis expressed his support loudly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotokatax and Thormede mused.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "In addition, there is another very important thing. I forgot to mention it last time, and you didn't notice it, Croto. The reason why the Samnites were able to provoke the war this time was that apart from the agreement of the four chiefs, who else could Played a big role in it?" Davers asked again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "High Priest of Samnite!" Clotokatax blurted out.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, the Samnite High Priest and his group of priests are above all tribes and have great appeal to the Samnite people. I even suspect that they are the primary initiators of this war. , because the priests of Hades from the kingdom entered the mountains and spread their faith, which violated their fundamental interests.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, we must ask them to dissolve the priesthood, and let each tribe elect its own high priest. It must also be confirmed by the kingdom. The holding of the Savoanni sacrificial ceremony in Samona must be coordinated by the kingdom. The four high priests Take turns hosting. "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crotokatax carefully pondered what Davos said, understood the use of political wisdom in it, and nodded frequently, but he was also a little confused: "Father, this article involves the beliefs and beliefs of the Samnites. I'm afraid they won't agree easily to this tradition that has been going on for many years."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Gaerni would definitely agree. The Aberum people have been oppressed by the priesthood, and I am afraid they have long wanted to have their own high priest of Savoni.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Kautini had to agree, for the tribe had suffered heavy losses and was almost destroyed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Pentneys had to agree, as their central town had been besieged for so long and was about to be captured. As long as the tradition is changed, the survival of the ethnic group can be exchanged. I think they will all agree in the end. As for Kalachni -" Davos sneered: "Other tribes have their own high priests, and the Samoni priest group they have can only be used by themselves (the birthplace of the Samoni race is in In the territory of Karacheni, there is a sacred mountain recognized by the Samnites, so it is also the place where the Samnites priests are entrenched). If we don't take advantage of the Samnites to solve this problem when they are at their weakest, , the Samonites may bring a lot of trouble to the kingdom in the future! "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I understand." Crotokatax replied with sincerity.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Herni, based on what I said to Croto, write a letter to Alexis and ask him to talk to the Pentney and Cavutini people according to the opinions in the letter." After Davos finished speaking, he didn't say anything. Hear the response.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Father, Uncle Herney just went out." Crotokatax pointed outside the tent and reminded Davos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The tent was opened, and Henepolis walked in again: "Your Majesty, here are two more battle reports. One is from the Third Fleet, and the other is from Sicily."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Oh..." Davos reached out to take the letter and opened it to read it. The joyful expression before disappeared in an instant.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, is this bad news?" Henipolis asked curiously when he saw this.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It's not too bad." Davos quickly calmed down and said calmly: "The fleet infantry of the Third Fleet went ashore to attack a Phoenician village in Sardinia, but encountered the prepared Phoenicians. The two sides fought, and the Third Fleet lost more than 400 people. Fortunately, they successfully retreated in the end."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "More than 400 people?! This is a big loss!" Henipolis was a little surprised.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davers knew that Sardinia was different from Corsica. It was a large island with a large area of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;land, many larger rivers, and fertile hills and plains that could be used for grazing and planting, so Philippe There are a large number of Nikes on this island, and they have established larger city-states such as Saint Ibinia, Olbia, Salos, Kalaris, Nora, Surchi... They have enough The young and middle-aged citizens formed a coalition army of no less than ten thousand people. The news that the Third Fleet had captured Alenia could not have been hidden from the Sardinian Phoenicians, who were not far from Corsica. It was normal for them to be prepared, but Midorades had Victory underestimated them, and suffering such a setback would also allow him to be more clear-headed in his future actions.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, how should I reply?" Henepolis asked.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Just say that I already know. I hope they can learn a lesson and be more flexible and cautious in future military operations. They must use the advantages of the navy to expand the scope of the attack to the entire island so that the Feniki cannot judge the movements of the Third Fleet. ..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Father, no more reinforcements will be sent to support the Third Fleet?" Crotokatax interjected.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The Phoenicians in Sardinia have been protected by Carthage for many years. They are greedy for happiness and only want to defend their own territory. They have no ambitions and will not pose any threat to us. It is not a problem that we urgently need to solve now. , just have the Third Fleet to hold it back." Davos raised another letter in his hand and sighed softly: "Our biggest threat still comes from Sicily. Although the news that Sekorian is still alive has I was overjoyed, but Miltias was killed in battle, the 4th Fleet was crippled, friendly city-states on the south coast of Sicily fell one after another, and Syracuse suddenly sent troops to declare war... These bad news made me feel uneasy! This The Carthaginian army led by Mago is very powerful, and our Sicilian territory will be violently attacked by them..." Davos said with some worry, and after placing the letter on the table solemnly, he said no more , but put his hands up and started pacing back and forth in the tent.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Henipolis curiously picked up the letter and looked at it carefully. Clotokatax was not as bold as him. After all, he had received military training and understood military law. He knew that privately peeking at military information without permission would be severely punished. , so even though he was curious, he just looked at Henepolis.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The Carthaginian army and the Syracuseans launched an attack on our Sicilian territory together! Gena, Paragonia, and Taunis were attacked at the same time!" After seeing this, Henipolis whispered to Ke Lotokatax said.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "How many enemies are there?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The letter said that at least 100,000 people participated in the attack! Our army in Sicily only has more than 20,000 people, right?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "To be precise... there are about 30,000 people, the 7th and 8th legions, plus the Sicilian legion reserve..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Two people were talking quietly&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos stopped and said: "Croto, go and call Tormid. It seems it's time to take the city of Satnicum."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes!" Crotokatax walked out of the tent excitedly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, is it too early to attack the city of Satnicum at this time? The last time we attacked Antium, although the Romans only had 3,000 defenders, it cost us a lot. This Satnicum There are many more Roman soldiers in Qom than in Antium!" Henepolis couldn't help but remind him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "According to the observations of the mountain reconnaissance team, the number of patrols by the defenders on the city has been significantly reduced in the past two days, and when the Roman family members were trying to persuade them to surrender at the foot of the city, they lay on the battlements and listened, and their officers did not stop them... all of this This is a phenomenon that has never happened before, indicating that the morale of the Roman defenders has dropped significantly. I originally wanted to wait for a while, maybe the Roman defenders would surrender automatically, but I can't wait now. The sooner the war here ends, the better. The sooner we rescue Sicily!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos spoke resolutely, and Hernepolis did not persuade him any more. Instead, he followed Davos's previous instructions and began to write a reply to Alexis.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, Martius, the captain of the palace guard, walked into the tent: "Your Majesty, Commander Martonis has something important to see you."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Let him in."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Matonis strode into the tent with a joyful face and said loudly: "Your Majesty, Roman envoys have been sent from the city of Satnicum, and they are asking for surrender!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
