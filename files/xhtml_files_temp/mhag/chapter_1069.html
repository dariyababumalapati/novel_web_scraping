   Chapter 1069: Increase taxes?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   (Continued)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Actually, for today's citizens of the kingdom, paying a little more tax will not have much impact on their lives." Antaoris spoke again immediately. How could he only let Sipulos focus on beauty? Former: "I just asked Burcos and Finance Officer Archibides. Taking Thurii as an example, ordinary citizens here own at least 20 acres of land. The food harvested every year can not only meet their own needs, but also About 300 to 700 drachmas are obtained through sales (depending on the degree of harvest and changes in food prices), but this is not the bulk of their income. Since Thurii is the center of the kingdom, there are a large number of outsiders, and there is a strong demand for housing. , many citizens can earn one or two talents a year just by collecting rent.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   If the citizens of Thurii are special, let's take a look at Siculi, a small town in Sicily. The population there is only less than 4,000. The main citizens Income comes from farming. According to statistics from the Ministry of Finance, the food harvested by each family every year is at least 600 drachmas. This does not include the cattle, sheep, horses, chickens, ducks, pigs and other livestock they raise. In addition, , don't forget that they often go to workshops to work part-time in their spare time and earn a lot of money.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So what do these citizens with a lot of wealth do in their daily lives? Apart from daily expenses and participating in military training, They also spend money to buy sports equipment and participate in various competitive trainings; spend money to watch games, and even buy a lot of 'Tino's Blessing'; drink a lot of wine, visit many restaurants, and occasionally take a dip in a hot spring bath. The business of the women's branch is also very prosperous, and many citizens even purchase female slaves as concubines...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So how much tax do the citizens pay for the kingdom every year?" Antaoris opened his palms and smiled disdainfully: "On average, I'm afraid it's less than 10 drachmas! Maybe some people oppose the tax increase. If the people are already poor and new taxes are imposed, they will not only be resentful, but even riot. But the current situation in the kingdom is that the country The poor are rich! Your Majesty and our officials have worked hard to maintain the operation of the kingdom, stingy with every expenditure from the treasury. Even some public buildings have to rely on donations from the public to build... If this situation continues, the kingdom will What good does it do to the citizens to be unable to maintain due to tight treasury?!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the past 20 years, in this favorable environment that the Kingdom has worked hard to create and maintain, many citizens have transformed from impoverished refugees into wealthy and dignified people. Citizens of Theonia, now is the time for them to give back to the country! Even if the tax is increased by 5%, it will only make the citizens pay less than 50 drachmas, which is still a small amount for them A small amount of money, but it is indeed a great help to the kingdom, don't you think so?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Well said!" Davos praised him again, and once again glanced at the ministers with his profound eyes, and said loudly: "Everyone, do you have any objections to the issue of 'increasing taxes to form a new border army'?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Your Majesty, I have no objections." Lysias saw that Davos had clearly expressed his support, and everyone looked moved. , did not dare to stop him anymore, and bowed to respond.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I agree to increase taxes!" Hermon, Sedorum and other ministers also responded in the affirmative one after another.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay!" Davos slapped the armrest hard and said: "Now that we have reached an agreement, then Antaoris and Sipulos will take the lead, assisted by Alexis and Alkibiades, to formulate a detailed plan. In the tax increase bill, how much tax will be collected? How will it be collected? Where will it be used?... It must be written clearly in detail in order to be able to respond to the questions of the elders.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Here, I would like to solemnly remind everyone that in the establishment of the border army and Before the two tax increase bills are submitted to the Senate, no one must keep it strictly confidential and must not disclose it to outsiders. If the information is leaked and I find out who leaked it, I will not be lenient!" These&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   last few words, Davos spoke with such murderous intent that the ministers felt chills in their hearts, and they couldn't help but secretly remind themselves to be vigilant.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos retracted his stern gaze, softened his tone, and said: "Alexis, I have thought about it carefully. The number of soldiers recruited from foreign free people will not exceed two legions for the time being. After all, we have to consider the citizens." Don't let them think that we are preparing to use mercenaries to completely replace them and not let them serve and perform meritorious service."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After being reminded by Davos, Alexis suddenly understood what he had overlooked, and immediately responded with sincerity: "I Understood, Your Majesty."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, Davos's concerns did not end with this.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Being familiar with the history of his past life, he was even more worried that these recruited free people who were not yet loyal to the kingdom would gradually become privately owned, thereby threatening the security of the royal family and the kingdom, so he must always remain vigilant.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then, Davos said: "Antaoris and Sipulos, when you are discussing how much to increase taxes, don't just use the two legions I just mentioned as the benchmark. You should set a higher level appropriately for the future." Leave enough room and try to get it done at once, otherwise when the finances are tight again in the future, taxes will be increased frequently, which will not only make the Senate sad, but also the people will be uneasy." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Yes, Your Majesty." The two looked at each other and responded in unison.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos stood up from the wooden chair, straightened his body, looked at everyone, and said sonorously: "Everyone, I still say what I said, the kingdom is developing, the environment is changing, and old traditions and laws may not be applicable to this country. The new situation may become an obstacle. Therefore, as the elite of the kingdom, you manage all aspects of this kingdom. You must have flexible minds and sharp vision to discover problems in time and eliminate shortcomings in time. Only in this way can we ensure the long-term stability of our kingdom. If it continues to prosper, please remember it!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos's sincere words aroused everyone's deep thought.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What time is it now?" At this time, Davos felt a little in his stomach and asked the clerk Henipolis by the steps.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Henipolis glanced at the water clock in the corner of the hall: "It's already past noon."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Let the kitchen bring out the prepared lunch. You can't continue the discussion if you're hungry."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Passed. After a while, the guards placed small dining tables in front of the ministers, and then the servants brought out large exquisite pottery bowls, filled with steaming soup, with pieces of the same size floating on them. Beef, there is a handful of evenly thin dough deposited in the soup, as well as countless tiny powders of spices and herbs. The various fragrances are mixed together, and the aroma is fragrant and makes people salivate.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is a new delicacy introduced by Christoya Restaurant in recent years. The flour is fermented and repeatedly kneaded with water to form a tough dough. Then it is cut into thin sheets with a knife and rolled out. Cook it in water, then pour it into the already cooked beef soup, add seasonings and enjoy it... Because it is easy to make, smooth and refreshing, and delicious, you can also add auxiliary materials at will according to the diners' preferences, such as some vegetables. , so it is very popular among the people of the kingdom.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, the palace's kitchen is all run by chefs hired from Christoya's restaurant. Not only are their cooking skills extraordinary, but the raw materials they choose are naturally the best:&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Best quality wheat flour from Sikuli.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sikuli City is located at the foot of Mount Etna. The land area is small. Some Sikuli people have reclaimed some flat land on the mountainside in the past. It is very hard to work up and down the mountain every day. However, due to the accumulation of volcanic ash on the mountain, the land is extremely fertile and the cultivation The wheat grains that come out are full and taste very good after being ground into flour, and because the output is rare, it is expensive. Therefore, even if the Sikuli people join Theonia and regain new land, there are still very few people who are willing to do so. She worked tirelessly to farm on the mountainside, and most of the wheat she obtained was bought by Kristoya's restaurant to supply the royal family.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The one-year-old beef cattle from Grumentum in Lucalia are recognized by the people of the Kingdom of Theonia as the best beef cattle among Lucalia cattle, because there is a village just south of the city of Grumentum. The big lake - Lake Patuxino, the water is extremely clear, and the lakeshore is covered with grass. The calves of Grumentum grew up drinking the lake water and eating the grass on the lakeshore, so their meat is plump...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Everyone held a meeting for a long time. I was a little hungry, and when I was seduced by the aroma of the noodles, my appetite immediately increased. Not only did I finish the noodles and drink the noodle soup, some people even asked for an extra bowl.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The palace must gather ministers at least three times a month to hold important administrative meetings, which often start during the day. Lunch is provided by the palace. The ministers have long been used to it, so naturally they are not so restrained during meals.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After everyone finished eating, they took a short rest. The minister of construction, Heraclid, said: "Your Majesty, there is something wrong with the construction of the Enona-Rome road." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What problem?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "In Campania The Sidisini people in the mountainous area to the north obstructed our construction. Not only did they fail to provide labor and food as agreed, but the road construction materials we transported there were often lost... This greatly delayed our construction process." "I remember&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   that in The Sidisini people also participated in the road construction agreement signed three years ago. Not only did they agree, but they also signed." Lysias interjected.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Perhaps this mountain race felt that the highway passed through their territory, and more people traveling from north to south would affect the security of the territory, so they regretted it." Ansitanos said seriously: "Your Majesty, please allow me Send diplomats to Sidisini to protest against them and ask them to abide by the agreement and help us complete the road construction as soon as possible." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the past, the Sidisini were caught between the two major forces of the Volscian and Campanian Leagues .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the small mountains, they are conservative and xenophobic, and they are also very tactful. Just using words to condemn them may not have an obvious effect." Davos muttered and said: "Alexis, your Military Affairs Ministry notifies the Twelfth Legion (the legion's manpower resources The area is the eastern plain of Campania, and the military camp is built in Abella) gathered together and went to the edge of the northern mountainous area of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;Capua for military training to increase their momentum." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Yes."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
