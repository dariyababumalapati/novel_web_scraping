   Chapter 1113. At the Theonia military camp on the northern border&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   , since no new successor has arrived since then, many soldiers believe that as long as Maximus remains in this position for one more year, he will officially become the official when he has enough qualifications. Promoted to a heavy baggage officer.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus himself thought so, but what he knew better was: the reason why he was able to obtain a very important military position in the Border Corps from an unknown freed slave with no background in just one year , and is likely to become a mid-level officer of the Kingdom of Theonia in the next one or two years. This is related to his ability, but it is more likely to be the role played by the intelligence department behind the scenes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But in any case, this will be of great benefit to him becoming a citizen of the kingdom as soon as possible.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Because of this, he was no longer so upset about joining the intelligence service.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There are very few pedestrians on the streets in the military camp. They are either soldiers who just finished their duty yesterday and it is their turn to rest today. They are hanging out and chatting on the roadside with nothing to do. Or they are soldiers who are on duty to clean up various debris on the roadside. Sanitation, transporting garbage, feeding livestock, etc... But no matter who sees Maximus passing by, they will respectfully shout: "Good morning, Lord Maximus!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course Maximus will also be polite. Return the greeting.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The baggage officer has the power to purchase and distribute materials. He is the food and clothing officer of the soldiers. During Maximus's time as agent, he was not only able to be fair and selfless, but also provided materials and three meals a day. They all got better promotions, so even though they were both free men, he won the respect of the soldiers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus enjoyed the respect, which meant his abilities were recognized by his fellow soldiers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now he is no longer as repelled by the life in the military camp as he was at first, and has begun to integrate into it. Of course, this is also because as an officer, he has more vacations in a year and can go back to Thurii to spend more time with his wife and children.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus greeted them all the way to the center of the camp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition to the military camp headquarters, the most important building here is the granary. In order to preserve food, engineers from the Construction Department have racked their brains to design this kind of public granary in Theonia: it is a narrow and long two-story building. Buildings with fewer and smaller windows can prevent food from spoiling due to high temperatures or rain and humidity.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, in order to ensure that the granary is cool and breathable, multiple vents are built around the bottom of the granary, and the floor of the first floor of the granary is laid above the vents. In this way, even if mice and other pests get into the house through the vents, they will not Unable to pass through the floor, enter the granary and harm the grain.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In order to prevent the walls from cracking due to excessive compression of grain or other items accumulated in the cabin, buttresses are built outside the walls of the granary.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There are also many large dry wooden boxes placed in the granary, which are used to store the raw material for the soldiers' staple food - flour. When the soldiers use it, they only need to open the outlet at the bottom of the wooden box, and the flour will flow out, thus making the flour Basically in a sealed state, its shelf life will naturally be longer.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   By the time Maximus arrived at the granary, there were already more than a dozen pack cars parked here, and the pack cars were loaded with bags of flour.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The purchasing director came forward and reported to him: "Lord Maximus, this time the Etruscans sent us 20 tons of flour. I gave it to Luca and Arretium. ) The military camps each sent 6 tons, and 8 tons were left here." (Note: The Etruscan League assigned the entire northern and northwest border land to Theonia. The Ministry of Military Affairs based on the terrain and the Gauls' According to the invasion situation, military camps were established near the three Etruscan border city-states of Lucca, Florentia, and Aretium.)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus carefully looked at the recorded account books and signatures, and then wrinkled The eyebrows said: "The autumn harvest has just ended. I have not heard that various Etruscan city-states have failed harvests. They should not only provide such a small amount of food." "The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Etruscans said, 'The wheat has just been harvested, and the time is too tight. , they are short of manpower and cannot grind much flour. If we are willing to grind our own flour, they are willing to provide wheat directly.'" The purchasing officer said: "But I refused because we are also short of manpower and do not have enough stone mills. , so the Etruscans can only promise to send us food in half a month."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You made the right decision. Well, in half a month..." Maximus made an estimate, and then Said: "Our food reserves are enough to last for half a month, but you have to keep an eye on it at all times and urge the Etruscans to prevent them from delaying."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Our transport ship is also Is it coming soon?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Probably in the next few days."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "When you go to Pisae (an Etruscan city-state near Lucca, a seaside town) to load and unload supplies, don't forget to remind them that next time Bring more mutton and woolen clothing. The winter here is relatively cold, and some soldiers got frostbite last year. I hope we can survive this year safely.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I heard that the prices of cattle and sheep at the livestock market in Thurii have dropped sharply this year. This is Because these ethnic groups in central Italy also transport the livestock of their tribes to Turii for sale, there are too many cattle and sheep in the livestock market... I believe the Ministry of Military Affairs can easily meet our requirements." "I made a note&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   of it. "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When we let the laborers carry flour inside later, try to empty half of the granary, and then collect more hay and store it in the granary. Winter is coming, and we have to reserve more fodder for the livestock and war horses..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus told the purchasing supervisor while watching the laborers unload bags of flour from the oxcart and carry them to the granary.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, his confidant statisticians are also carefully checking whether the quantity of flour is consistent with what the purchasing director said.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the statistician completed the confirmation, Maximus did not immediately sign his name on the account book.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the entire loading and unloading work is completed, he will come to the granary in the afternoon to check and confirm.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now, he said goodbye and left. The next place he was going to was the armory.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The baggage camp is not only in charge of food reserves, the storage of weapons and equipment is also one of the important tasks he is responsible for.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Yesterday, a company sent by the military camp repelled the Gauls who invaded the Florentia territory. When they returned, it was too late, so he did not have time to learn more about the loss of weapons and equipment and the acquisition of trophies.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   According to Maximus's habit, confirmation is usually required on the same day. Postponing it to the second day is already a bit of a delay in his work.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The armory was built not far from the camp gate to facilitate the troops in collecting equipment when they went on an expedition.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, there are not many weapons and armors in the armory. They have been distributed to the soldiers one by one for a long time, and the soldiers themselves do the maintenance and care.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During the rest period, these armors, long shields, spears, daggers, and javelins were placed in the soldiers' dormitories. If they were damaged and rendered unusable during non-combat periods, compensation would even have to be paid, because these weapons and equipment belong to the soldiers. The kingdom owns them, unlike regular legion soldiers, the individual weapons and equipment already belong to themselves.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The armory mainly stores military supplies such as tents, quilts, blankets, shovels, and shovels, as well as some expendable weapons such as arrows, javelins, and a small amount of armor weapons.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Maximus rushed to the armory, he learned that the keeper of the armory had transported a batch of javelins and arrows out of the city to the training ground.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There was a battle just yesterday, and military training is still going on today. This legion commander from Carthage always has strict requirements for the soldiers!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ...Maximus thought for a while and decided to go to the training ground.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In various military camps in Theonia, most of the training grounds are located in the military camps, and the training grounds can be changed into rugby and football competition venues at any time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, these three military camps located on the northern border of Etruria did not set up training grounds within the camp, mainly because there were not many troops stationed in each military camp, and it was not easy to reinforce them in a short time. In order to facilitate defense , we must try our best to reduce the area of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;the camp, so military facilities that cover a large area like the training ground can only be set up outside the camp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Knowing that Maximus was leaving the city, his followers soon came with a horse from the stables.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus mounted his horse, passed the inspection of the city guards, and left the military camp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Within 50 meters outside the military camp, it is covered by the entire trench system. From the city wall outwards are: deer village, trench, shallow trench, lily bush (dig deep pit, bury sharp wooden stakes), meat hook...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Masi When Muse left the city, he also caught a glimpse of a squad leader leading the soldiers to place trees with many pointed branches in the shallow ditch.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Due to the existence of these defensive facilities, although this area was often attacked by Gauls, the military camp was never attacked.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After passing the trap area, it is the civilian area.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The family members of the Border Legion soldiers are not allowed to accompany the army, but after the military camp is established here, some Etruscan people will naturally move to settle near the military camp because they believe that the protection of the Theonian soldiers will be nearby. It is very safe. In fact, they are rarely attacked by the Gauls (the Theonia Senate has already passed a resolution: allowing the Etruscan people to settle in the new territory on the northern border of the Theonia Kingdom, And you can rent land, or apply to become a Theonian citizen in accordance with the new "Immigration Act").&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition, some Etruscan traders opened shops here to earn money from the border legionnaires.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Pottery shops, blacksmith shops, shoe shops, cloth shops, butcher shops... were built one after another along the avenue. Of course, the most popular one among the soldiers was the tavern.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The soldiers who participated in the battle yesterday were all given a day off today. Some of them asked their team officers for leave to leave the camp and go to the tavern to drink.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A can of wine mixed with water, a can of beer with a lot of residue, a plate or two of stewed chickpeas, a plate of sliced &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;bacon... The price of the wine is not enough for these soldiers who are paid every month. It's not worth mentioning to them at all, but it can make a small team of soldiers sit around a table, drink wine, and chat for a long time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thanks to the other side of remembrance for the tip!&#13;
