   Chapter 1078: Turiyi's House Rental Experience&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Later, some smart private homeowners went to discuss with the household registration department, and finally reached an agreement: these homeowners can also publish the information of the rental houses in the household registration office, and the household registration personnel will recommend it, but Prices are subject to the supervision of the Ministry of Commerce, taxes must be paid on time, and rental houses are subject to supervision by the construction agency. Although the homeowner has paid a certain price, with the endorsement of the Kingdom's public sector, it is naturally favored by those in need. Later, other homeowners had to join in, otherwise there would be no business, thus gradually standardizing the chaotic housing rental market in the kingdom.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, the recommendation of public rental housing and private rental housing is a big gap, especially in Thurii. Corruption and bribery will inevitably occur, and it has been reported by the tribune many times. This aroused the anger of Davos, and ordered the Supervisory Minister to Sesta personally supervised the inspection and arrested a group of household registration officials to suppress this evil trend. To this day, this area is still the target of the tribunes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The reason why the person at the household registration office was happy to see someone wanting to rent a private house was because once the rental was successful, some landlords would express their gratitude to him, such as treating him to a meal, sending a basket of fruit, etc., because This is so trivial that the supervisory authorities will hardly care about it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The household registration officer recommended a better private rental house to him, but Maximus just turned a deaf ear. After all, he was literate, and he already had his own requirements for the rental house: first, the house should be large enough, because he has a family of four. secondly, the rent should be cheaper because he does not have enough savings and plans to use most of the money on his children's education in the future, because according to his understanding, it will take at least five or six years for him to become a citizen of Theonia. years, and during this period of time, children are not eligible to go to Theonia School. They can only go to privately built schools. Although the tuition is expensive and the quality is worse, he can't let his children We will waste this time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus read through all the densely packed rental information on the wall, and roughly identified five or six targets. Then he took out 10 Obol and bought a small piece of papyrus (the original price of a piece of paper was less than 10 Obol (but it includes the service fee of the household registration office), copied the address above, thanked the household registration officer, and then left the household registration office, taking his family with him to find the homeowner according to the address on the paper.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The first homeowner we found was a widow. Her husband was a soldier of the First Legion and died in Latium. She did not remarry and took care of her three children alone. She relied on the 30 acres of land on the Sybari Plain left by her husband while letting her Their slaves were responsible for farming and renting out houses, and they lived a pretty good life.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But when she saw that the person who came to rent the house was a Roman, she immediately refused to rent it because her husband died under a Roman spear, and she still harbored resentment for this.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus had no choice but to leave.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The owner of the second house he found was a disabled man, but he was a soldier of the Second Legion. He was seriously injured in the war with the Romans and had his feet amputated. He could tell at a glance that Maximus was a Roman. , without giving him a chance to speak, he kicked him out of the house.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus had been to the city of Turiyi several times before, but he always entered in a hurry and returned in a hurry after finishing his work. He did not get in touch with the residents of Turiyi as deeply as he did today. This time he was deeply involved. After experiencing the impact of that war on the Thurii people, many of them probably had a very bad impression of the Romans, which made Maximus increase his vigilance.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He finally found the third homeowner, a middle-aged man. From the awkward way he walked, Maximus judged that his left leg was somewhat disabled, which gave him a bad feeling.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sure enough, as soon as the middle-aged man saw him, he said: "You must be a Roman!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus felt tight, but he had to say truthfully: "...Yes, I am a Roman, and I just got the Free, ready to live in Thurii, so I want to rent your house."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The landlord did not reply directly, but looked at him, and then continued with emotion: "Although many people think that Romans and Latins are the same race , they all look the same, so it's hard to tell them apart. But in fact, the Romans are still very different from the Latins. They are more confident and more imposing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   5 years ago, I was the company captain of the First Legion and participated in It was such a large-scale war that we fought against multiple races. In my memory, the battle with the Romans was the most difficult to fight. It was much more difficult to fight than the Carthaginians later! Among them, the&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Osti The defensive battle of Asia is something I can never forget. I still remember that your Roman army launched an all-out attack on the city of Ostia. We finally repelled one wave, and then another wave came up... We fought until late at night, the soldiers. I was too tired to stand up. I saw the corpses of your Romans lying under the city. At that time, many people thought that you had suffered heavy casualties. You should rest and recuperate on the second day and not attack again. Who knew that at dawn the next day, You just blew the attack bugle, and we attacked for three days in a row!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ... My left leg was injured at that time ... I saw some familiar comrades died in battle, and I really thought that I We will also follow them to Hades. Unexpectedly, His Majesty ordered us to evacuate and burn Osti... At that time, many people in our legion were very unwilling! Because this was the first time since the establishment of our first legion. Although it is His Majesty's order to retreat when facing an enemy attack... we have to admit that if we insist on defending, the First Army is likely to suffer heavy casualties..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hearing the homeowner's sigh, Maximus remained silent. After a while, he whispered: "...At that time, I served as the squadron leader in the siege team. It was those days of fighting that destroyed our confidence...leading to the final defeat..." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Fortunately now We all belong to the same kingdom, no more wars!" The landlord comforted him, and then said: "You are here to rent a house, that's no problem. How much do you want to rent it for?" Maximus originally&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   said He thought that there was no chance for this family, but the landlord's words gave him a surprise, and he immediately said: "I hope to rent the building near the Asinu-Amara Arena for 8 drak per month. The rented room."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just as the landlord was about to speak, the servant standing by came up and whispered a few words. He showed surprise and asked, "Are you living with your wife and two children?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus Nodding: "They are waiting outside the door."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The homeowner thought for a while and said: "The house on the top floor is cheap and has a larger area, but it is made of wood and is at a high place, so it cannot block the wind at night. , it will be colder, especially in winter. Your children are still young and may get sick easily... Well, it's still the same building. There is an empty room on the third floor that has not been rented out. The area is not small. The original rental price It's 25 drachmas. I rent it to you and only charge 13 drachmas per month. What do you think?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   was surprised. He did not accept it immediately. Instead, he asked cautiously: "Why would you give such a great benefit to a stranger?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The homeowner did not feel unhappy because of his hesitation, but said sternly: "Because you are a Roman, and you are a Roman who has fought with us. Your bravery has won my admiration, and you have come to seek me." He asked for help, but bravely admitted that he was once my enemy. This honest behavior made me feel more at ease. In addition-"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   the homeowner looked at him carefully, and then said firmly: "You should have worked in a slave camp before. , it is logically impossible to gain freedom before the Hades celebration, but if you did it, you must have performed very well to be pardoned! Although I lost a little money, I was able to meet a Roman who was worth making friends with. Man, I think it's worth it!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The landlord's words were frank, and Maximus was moved. He saluted solemnly and said, "Thank you for your trust. I am willing to rent the room on the third floor. My name is Marcy... I My name is Brutus Maximus."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Nisidamas, now the mayor of the village south of the slave camp, it is a pleasure to meet you." The owner of the house returned the greeting equally seriously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus was not slightly dissatisfied because the homeowner only named him. According to his understanding, many Theonian citizens were formerly refugees or slaves, and now they have become the first Theonian with status. The citizens of the kingdom do not want to use the name of their lowly father as their surname, but they hope to use their own name as the surname of their descendants, so they still maintain only the name without gender, which was approved by King Davos. allow.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Nicedamas asked his slaves to take Maximus and his family to the rental building.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This building is located not far to the north of the Asinu-Amara Arena, just off the main road. It is surrounded by busy traffic and is very prosperous, which has also caused the housing rent here to rise.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The room type of this rental building is the most common "back"-shaped building in the outer city of Turii. It was first designed by engineers from the Ministry of Construction for public rental housing because it can maximize the use of space and provide more housing. , which can also take into account business and security, and has quickly become popular in the densely populated outer city of Turii.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The main body of this building is made of stone, about 13 meters high, with a total of 5 floors. The bottom floor is used for shops and offices, the upper 4 floors are housing, and the roof can be used for storage. Of course, private homeowners want to earn more With money, they often build wooden lofts on the roofs of buildings.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The center of the circular building is an open space, which ensures that both sides of the floor can be exposed to sunlight and air circulation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus followed the slave into the building and immediately saw a square pool in the open space in the center of the building. Clear water spurted out continuously from the mouth of a statue that might be a Greek god (Poseidon). In the middle of the pool There is also a statue of another Greek god, this one he is very familiar with - Hades, the protector of the Kingdom of Theonia.&#13;
