   Chapter 1073: Melses' Last Wish&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos listened carefully and finally nodded and said: "At the next executive meeting, what you said will become an important basis for the tax rate discussion." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What else are you discussing... Your Majesty, you can just be direct. Settle it," Melses muttered.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos seemed to have not heard anything. After seeing what he said, his spirit became even more depressed, so he said with concern: "You should have a good rest. I will come to visit you next time!" "Your&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Majesty, why don't you stay a little longer? ?! Next time you come back... I'm afraid you won't be able to see me..." Merses muttered again in a low tone.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Davos heard this, he felt sad. Just when he was about to comfort him, he heard Merses say softly: "Your Majesty, do you still remember the first time we met?... At that time, you had just invented Smoked sausage temporarily solved the mercenary's ration storage problem... After I found out, I immediately asked Menon to have you in my baggage train... I still remember the story you told us about the treasure that night... Yes With your help, it was the most relaxing time I felt while marching in Persia... I had a vague feeling that you would become a great person... So when Menon and you conflicted, I stood firmly with you. This side...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   now it proves how correct my choice was!...I, a bankrupt small businessman from Ionia, eventually became the finance minister of the most powerful kingdom in the Western Mediterranean, with tens of thousands of wealth in my hands. , What a blessing this is! I have no regrets anymore..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After hearing what Melses said, Davos didn't know what to say for a moment, so he forced a smile and said: "Actually, what you said is wrong. Before I was transferred to the baggage train, you met me once... At that time, I was walking to the baggage camp, and I was met by you. You suspected that I wanted to steal food because I was hungry, and you specifically asked the guards to drive me away."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   " There is such a thing, I have no impression at all!" Merses' eyes widened in surprise, and then he laughed: "It's a pity that I only know about it now, otherwise I would often brag to Antonios, Xilos and the others... I am the only person who has&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ever reprimanded Your Majesty!" "I only remembered it now, otherwise you would have had such an easy life under my hands in the past ten years?!" Davos also joked with a smile.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even the usually serious Martius smiled.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Henibris, who was on the side, listened to them telling their past events. From the laughter, he could feel the deep comrades-in-arms friendship between them, and he couldn't help feeling a little envious and yearning in his heart.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty." The smile on Melses's face had not disappeared. He said in a deep voice: "After my death, I will donate most of my property to the kingdom..." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Oh, you stingy guy. Are you willing?!" Davos teased with a smile, thinking he was joking.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I'm serious. This is my will! I will donate 80% of my inheritance to the kingdom and leave only 20% to support my family!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos saw Melses' serious expression and immediately stopped smiling. He asked in a deep voice: "Are you really willing to give up?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I don't have children, so what's the point of not giving up..." Merses murmured, a little absent-minded: "Your Majesty, the Kingdom of Theonia is yours to lead us to work together." What we have built up with so much hard work can be regarded as our child..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos was quite moved when he heard this. He sat on the edge of the bed, patted Mersith's swollen hand, and said emotionally. : "On behalf of the kingdom, I would like to thank you for your generosity!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, if I donate this money...can you get me a statue...to be stationed in the Pantheon..." Merses' next words stunned Davos. Then he burst into laughter: This is the true character of Melses!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos subconsciously wanted to reprimand him first: the qualification to enter the Pantheon is not a commodity and can be bargained for!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  ---&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But seeing Merses' pale face and hopeful eyes, Davos felt soft and said directly: "Even if you don't donate these properties, the huge contributions you have made to the kingdom in the past will make you useless." You have the controversial qualification to enter the Pantheon. Not only that, I am also planning to erect a statue of you in front of the Finance Department, so that future Finance Department officials will follow your example and be stingy with every Obol in the kingdom. There can be no waste, let alone corruption!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Thank you, Your Majesty...Thank you, Your Majesty..." At that moment, turbid tears flowed from Merses's godless eyes...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Walking out of Merses' mansion, Davos couldn't help but Stopping and looking back, he thought of Cornelus, who passed away a few years ago, and of Melses, who would go to the Elysee at any time. He felt very heavy: the heroes who had followed him to create Theonia were gradually becoming He was entering the last years of his life...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He was thinking when he turned around and saw Martius standing upright, but his gray beard showed his age, and he sighed in his heart: "Martius, you are also old. Now..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, I can still easily defeat the young guard! I can still serve as your guard!" Martius answered forcefully.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay... okay..." Davos subconsciously touched his beard, and then said to Henepolis: "Have you remembered what I just said to Merses?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Henepolis immediately said Answer: "Remember, let Lord Melses stationed in the Pantheon and erect a statue for him in the Finance Department."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Well, go back and draft a proposal and discuss it at the next executive meeting as soon as possible... Melses is afraid I can't hold on for long..." Davos let out a long sigh.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the past few days, a rumor suddenly appeared in Tulii: Etruscan envoys asked for help from the kingdom. At the same time, in view of the frequent attacks by indigenous people on the borders of southern Iberia, After the invasion, King Davos was ready to agree to the ministers' proposal and send one or two legions to the southern border of Iberia and the northern border of Etruria to build fortresses to defend against the invasion of the indigenous people.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   According to the Ministry of Military Affairs, every legionnaire must be on duty at the station for at least half a year...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This news quickly spread throughout the entire city of Thurii, and soon spread to other cities.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The officers, soldiers, reserve soldiers of each legion, as well as their families and relatives are discussing this matter every day. You must know that they account for a large proportion of the population of the kingdom, which naturally caused a huge stir across the country. of waves.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not long after, news came out: Those defensive fortresses would be built at the forefront of the border. There would be no town markets around them, only the indigenous people who kept coming to harass them. For the safety of the soldiers, the garrison troops might not consider giving them any protection. During their vacation, let them go to the towns behind to rest and relax, and even go home to visit relatives...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as this news came out, the citizens of the legionnaires were even more uneasy. Many anxious citizen soldiers gathered together and went to their respective military camps to ask the senior officers stationed in the military camps for detailed information and said: "We are not afraid. We fight against powerful enemies, even if they bleed or even give our lives; but we are afraid of being trapped in the fortress like criminals, without freedom for more than half a year, completely unable to take care of our families..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Some radical citizens of Thurii even gathered together to Go to the Senate and ask the senators: I hope they can oppose this proposal and not let it pass.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Many senators were confused and asked the rotating chairpersons: "Is such a proposal really there?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Lysias and the others said in a unified voice: "Some ministers did put forward this proposal, but His Majesty did not agree immediately. Consider this matter carefully."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While there was a lot of commotion outside, Davos was sitting quietly in the palace office. After listening to Aristelas' investigation report on the entire situation, he thought for a while and said : "Now that the water has boiled, we need to put something in it first to see if we can cook something good."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, Your Majesty." Aristelas understood.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Is there any other news?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, we have collected evidence of Servius, Phrius, Aulus...these former Roman nobles trying to rebel." Aristelas said , respectfully handed over a stack of records in his hand.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos read it carefully and said calmly: "There are still a lot of people. While the public's attention is focused on the dispatch of border troops, transfer these evidences and lists to the Thurii Inspection Department. Let them be responsible for the arrest."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes." Aristinas hesitated and then said: "Your Majesty, there is a secret report from Iberia. Hasdrubal and a few members of the Magonid family often gather together. , drunkenness, and insulting the kingdom..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos didn't even frown and asked: "Are there any other suspicious circumstances?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Nothing has been found yet."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It's better to vent your dissatisfaction in person than it seems on the surface. He must be strong because he has some conspiracy secretly." Davos said disapprovingly: "Continue to observe."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, "Bang! Bang! Bang!" There was a knock on the door.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Come in!" As soon as Davos finished speaking, Aristelas naturally retreated to the corner.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, Priest Plessinas wants to see you!" Henepolis walked in and said.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Invite him in."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plessinas did not come alone. There were two priests behind him, each holding a few wooden boards.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, the design selection for the statue on the top of the mountain has ended. We have brought the winner's work. Please make the final judgment on which design to choose to cast the statue on the top of the mountain." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The results came out so quickly?!" Diver Si became interested and immediately said: "Put them on the table, let's look at them slowly one by one." From the corner of his eye, he&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   caught sight of Henepolis stretching his neck to look this way, and Davos looked left and right again. He waved and said: "You two should come and have a look and give me some opinions."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Henipolis and Aristelas immediately came over.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
