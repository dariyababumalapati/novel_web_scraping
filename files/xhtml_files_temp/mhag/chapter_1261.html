   Chapter 1261 A Distinctive Race (1)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The bronze round basin on the altar has been filled with olive oil. When the torch comes into contact with it, it immediately ignites a blazing flame and sends heat waves around.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Amid the cheers of the audience, Max seemed to see familiar faces through the hot firelight. They all smiled at him and shouted loudly and powerfully: "Yes, Captain!" Then in Under his leadership, he shouted the name of Hades and killed the fleeing enemies...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Two lines of hot tears rolled down Max's cheeks.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   With the support of the two teenagers, Max walked to the exit of the arena. His mood recovered and he hurriedly thanked the two teenagers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But I heard a young man wave his hand and say: "Uncle, you're welcome! My name is Christod, and Clotokatax is my father."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And another young man then said: "My...my name is Ai Non, Adoris is my father!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Commander?!...Captain?!..." Max was stunned for a moment, as if there was some divine will, bringing his thoughts back to that place again. In a bloody battle.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   His emotions surged, and he hugged the two teenagers and cried loudly...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   this time, in the arena, the referee team Director Chalcedis passed through the team of athletes and came to the front of the altar. Facing the scrutinizing gazes of the athletes, he solemnly said loudly: "Gods above, I, Chalcedis, as a member of this sports meeting Referees, I am willing to swear to you in front of thousands of spectators that we will always treat every athlete fairly and fairly in the sports games, preside over every competitive event in strict accordance with the rules of the sports games, and handle every dispute seriously and responsibly... If you violate the oath, please punish me!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as he finished speaking, more than 200 priests from the entire referee team began to take the oath in unison, and the voices of more than 200 people gathered together could be heard clearly by the spectators in the nearby stands.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Many spectators from Greek city-states were stunned after hearing the oath. Although the Theonian Games had the same oath-taking part as previous Greek games, there were obvious differences: First of all, whether it was the Olympian Games or the Pythian Games, , Corinth Games, Nemean Games... they all swore in front of a main god. How could they swear to all the gods like now? This seems to be a bit of a joke. When the problem really arises, which god will do it? What about divine punishment?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Secondly, in all previous sports games, athletes have sworn, and the priests who serve as referees do not need to swear, because they are the spokespersons of the gods in the world and are respected by people. How can they engage in cheating in sports games? But in fact, the priests are used by athletes and even Instances of city-state bribery and blatant tampering with game results occurred from time to time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, the priests took the lead in swearing an oath at the Theonian Games, which showed that the Kingdom of Dionysius attached great importance to this Games and was determined to combat cheating at the Games.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thirdly, in previous sports games, athletes swore in front of the statues in temples under the guidance of priests, which was relatively private compared to the audience.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But this time the oath was sworn in the center of the arena, and the oath clearly mentioned that "the audience outside the stadium should serve as witnesses", which was more pleasing to the people. After all, the punishment of the gods was illusory, and the people The anger can be expressed directly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In any case, the novel swearing method of the Theonian Games successfully aroused heated discussion among the audience.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, the athlete representative of Turiyi once again led all the athletes to solemnly swear together with a similar oath. The powerful voice of thousands of people spread throughout the entire venue, causing an even greater sensation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Amid the heated discussion of the audience, the opening ceremony of the Theonia Games finally came to an end, and the referee team and the athlete team began to leave the field in order.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Most of the audience felt unsatisfied with this. Even the most picky representatives of Olympia, Delphi, and Corinth, although they believed that the games in their city-states were more sacred, had to admit that the opening ceremony of their games was too short and not lively enough. , and too private, far less able to attract the attention of the less knowledgeable audience than the opening ceremony of the Theonian Games.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty the King, just as you said in your invitation letter before, the opening ceremony of this Games is indeed grand and novel. It opened my eyes and I feel like I haven't seen enough yet!" Plato praised sincerely.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Xenophon wanted to retort, but in the end he couldn't.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos laughed and said: "This opening ceremony has been going on for several hours, and it is now noon. According to the habits of the Theonians, it is time for lunch. It doesn't matter if you haven't seen enough, the good things are still to come. We had lunch and continued to watch the following games."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the first day of the Theonian Games, there was not only an opening ceremony, but also a 100-meter race afterwards.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is Davos's suggestion. He plans to use this set of punches to clearly tell those who are doubtful about whether the Theonian Games can be successfully held: Not only is the opening ceremony of the Theonian Games beautiful, but the competition is also very exciting. Wonderful!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Thus arousing the enthusiasm of all the native and foreign people in Thurii to watch the sports games.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While eating lunch, Xenophon raised his doubts: "Davos, when I entered the arena, the wall at the entrance was I saw the notice you posted online. In addition to this opening ceremony, there will also be a 100-meter qualifying competition. Does this 100-meter refer to 100 meters?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Did your Theonian movement also change the distance of the running competition in the traditional Greek games?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The weights and measures implemented by the Kingdom of Theonia when it was first founded were very different from other city-states in Greece. As the country's strength became stronger, trade exchanges with other city-states became increasingly frequent. Theonia's weights and measures were more systematic due to their , more sophisticated and easier to operate, and gradually began to be accepted by foreign merchants. When the Greek Alliance was established and Theonia became the overlord of the entire Greece, in the past few years, Theonia's weights and measures have gradually replaced the Greek city-states. The relatively confusing traditional weights and measures... So Xenophon and Plato are familiar with the concept of "meter".&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos took a sip of cold syrup and explained calmly: "The people who passed through Theonia Academy Research has proven that the distance that we humans can sprint with all our strength is only about 100 meters. As the distance gradually lengthens, endurance will replace explosive power. Therefore, the 100-meter race is a test of the speed that we adults can achieve when sprinting with all our strength. limit.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In this way, the shortest distance (approximately 192 meters) in running competitions in previous sports games was... a test to show the physical endurance of athletes after sprinting with all their strength and maintaining such a high speed?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Plato thought thoughtfully.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "That's right.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Davos nodded in response: "The 200-meter race in the Theonia Games and the shortest distance running competition in previous games are all to achieve this goal, while the 400-meter and 800-meter races are more focused on endurance tests... "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What about the marathon?" Xenophon interrupted him and asked: "Is it designed to completely test the speed endurance of adults? Davos, how did you originally think of using it as a competition event?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Xenophon and Plato are not interested in the current Athenian government, but they are all Athenians after all, and they are also proud of the glorious history of Athens. Davos knew this very well, so he solemnly said: "The Battle of Marathon will It is of great significance to all Greeks. The competition in its name will undoubtedly make the Greek people, and even the entire Mediterranean people, remember that long-gone history for a long time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As far as the competition itself is concerned, marathon running is not just It tests the maximum endurance of the players, and it also tests their willpower. Let alone winning the championship, it is not easy to persist in running the whole distance." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Yes, even the Scud Pheidippitz of the year Inspired by the victory in the battle, I ran the entire distance without stopping, but in the end I was exhausted. It shows that marathon is a very dangerous event!" Xenophon said with a serious face.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "But even so, there are still many Athenians who have signed up to participate in this event. They obviously want to bring the glory of the marathon championship back to Athens." Plato said.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Then they will face competition from Theonia's best long-distance runners." Davos smiled and said seriously: "However, don't worry too much. We have considered the dangers of this competition and specially prepared the entire race. Medical staff are deployed along the marathon route. If any abnormality is discovered, rescue will be carried out immediately. Moreover, we have also made special regulations for this race. Players participating in this race must do what they can. When their physical condition is poor, Allow him to withdraw from the game midway..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just when Davos and two friends were chatting about the sports meeting in the royal stand, The audience was not idle either.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Theonians have been watching ball games for many years and are very experienced. Knowing that they will stay in the arena for a whole day today, most of them have brought lunch in advance and are already dining at their seats with their families.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the foreign audience did not have the habit of eating lunch, they cheered and applauded non-stop this morning and consumed a lot of money. When they saw the Theonian audience next to them chewing food, they all felt hungry.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, many vendors appeared in the passage between the auditoriums in time, selling bread, salted fish, cured meat, dried fruits, syrup... and they were all sold out quickly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While eating, the audience excitedly talked about the opening ceremony just now, while watching the scene in the stadium curiously, guessing how the next game would go.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
