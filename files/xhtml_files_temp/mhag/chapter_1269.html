   Chapter 1269 Racing Competition (2)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos ignored the noise of women and children and overlooked the huge yellow arena paved with a mixture of fine sand and clay, as well as the long strip of isolation in the center of the arena. , asked: "Klotto, how many racing races are there today?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As the leader of the sports meeting preparatory group, Clotto Kataks can be said to be well aware of the entire schedule of all competitions, and he immediately replied: " There are three racing races today."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, cheers rang out from the audience again, and it turned out that the racers were driving their cars into their respective starting gates.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked at the row of starting gates at the south end of the field with interest and asked: "Which regions and city-states are there players from in the first game?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "There are players from the Po River region of the Kingdom, including Xi Numibi. Asia, Thebes, the Bruti region of the Kingdom, Macedonia, Cyrenaica...well, and our Thurii region..." Crotokatax knew all of them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It seems that the competition in the first round is very fierce!" Davos said with interest after listening: "The racing players in the Po River area should be Gallic citizens. They are good at fighting on complex terrain battlefields. Driving a chariot for impact should be more comfortable now in the arena. The Bruti area was originally a famous pastoral area of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;the kingdom. Although Bruti horses used to be more suitable as horses because they were short and good at climbing mountains, in recent years they have changed from A group of Lusitanian horses were introduced to the Iberian Peninsula and bred on a large scale. I heard that they are not inferior to the Gallic horses.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Bay horses of Cyrenaica are also very famous. It is said that they were sold to the Peloponnese in large quantities. The city-state nobles; well... the Macedonian cavalry, I believe you have experienced their power in the Battle of Tegea a few years ago: and West Lumbia, which is also a region rich in horses, our light cavalry regiment It is composed of Western Lumibians... These players all come from the famous horse-producing areas. Both horses and drivers should be the result of selecting the best. I believe the competition in the competition will be very fierce!" Dai! Firth commented with interest while touching his chin.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Grandpa, what about Thebes?" Christode interjected from behind.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Thebes... I don't think their car has the strength to compete with other players." Davos said firmly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Father, Thebes has won many racing championships in previous Greek games, and the owner of Thebes racing car this time is Pelopidas." Clotokatax reminded.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The past is the past. In the past, the Greeks did not allow foreigners to participate in the games, and the Macedonians who were close to them did not have the opportunity to participate. But in our games today, the Greeks will see that the entire Mediterranean world is better at driving carriages than they are. There are so many races!" Davos still insisted on his judgment: "So whether it is an individual or a country, we must not rest on our laurels, but must face the world bravely and dare to compete with strong opponents, so that we can have greater success. Improve! Chris, do you think what grandpa said is right?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Grandpa is so right!" Christod nodded repeatedly like a chicken pecking at rice.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Kristoya, who hugged him next to her, couldn't help laughing and scolding: "Little flatterer!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos smiled kindly: "Chris, grandpa will ask you a question, who is Pelopidas? "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Military commander of the Boeotian Alliance!" Christode blurted out.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Awesome!" Davos gave a thumbs up, then patted the couch next to him: "Come to Grandpa and do it!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Christod was eager to try, he still looked at his grandma first.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Go, go." Christoya waved her hand, and then reminded Davos: "You are not allowed to get close to the railing in front!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos nodded.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Christod excitedly rushed to sit next to Davos, and then asked: "Grandpa, you haven't mentioned the players from our Turiyi region yet?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Oh!" Davos slapped his forehead: "I Why have we forgotten our own players! Croto, who is our racing driver in Thurii? Who is the owner of the racing car?" "The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   driver's name is Procris, the younger brother of the former cavalry hero Sobocos. My son, he won the first place in the previous racing competition held in the Turiyi region. The provider of the car he drove today should be the Turiyi Carriage Chamber of Commerce."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Sobox..." Davos heard This long-dusted name made me feel a little sad: "I seem to remember the current president of the Thuri Carriage Chamber of Commerce... he should also be the son of Sobox, right?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Yes, father, the president of the Thuri Carriage Chamber of Commerce." His name is Pebaricius, the eldest son of Sobox. He once served as an officer of the First Cavalry Legion, but his leg was injured during the kingdom's rescue of its ally Wolsey and the battle with Rome more than ten years ago. He was seriously injured and finally had to retire and turn to running the carriage shop left by his father..." Crotoka Tax introduced.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This family has made a lot of contributions to the kingdom!" Davos sighed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Uncle Croto, I see there are 8 starting gates below, but why did you only mention 7 riders just now?" Apox's son Tisiphonus said suddenly. He was three years younger than Christode, but he was He inherited his father's intelligence and stability and excelled in school.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Clotokatax was stunned, and he quickly counted and said apologetically: "I missed one, there is another racing car that should be... from Egypt."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Oh, Egypt!" Davos He looked at each other calmly with Crotokartax.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the fifth day after he talked to his son that night, he received definite news from Africa: Jie Hao had been found. His boat was hit by a storm and crashed a hundred miles west of Cyrenaica. Under the cliffs on the seaside outside, the bodies of him and his entourage were also discovered among the rocks. According to the chief executive of the African region, "all died of drowning in the sea."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   For this reason, Davos also convened an emergency kingdom administrative meeting yesterday to convince the ministers to deal with this emergency according to his plan: On the one hand, Theonia sent envoys and fleets to Africa transported the bodies of Jie Hao and his entourage back to Egypt; on the other hand, it temporarily blocked the news that "the Egyptian envoy delegation was destroyed by the storm" in the kingdom, and at the same time asked the Ministry of Military Affairs to notify Chalcedis, who quietly gathered in Sicily Soldiers from several legions came to watch the development of the situation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, although the Egyptian athletes' delegation in Thurii was confused as to why their country's envoys had not arrived yet, they were able to participate in various events with a calm mind.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It is said that Egypt is the first country in the Mediterranean to use chariots. Chariot archers are still an important unit of Egypt. It seems that the competition in this first group will be really fierce!" Davos sighed, Then he complained to his eldest son: "You are not as attentive as our little Tixi! Tixi, come watch the game with grandpa!" As he said this, he patted the couch on the other side.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Oh." Tisiphonus responded, stood up and walked forward.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I want to sit with grandpa too!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I want to sit too!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing this, the other children started shouting one after another, refusing to listen to their parents no matter how much they tried to dissuade them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay, okay, move a couch next to me and let the children sit here." Davos said with a smile.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After watching the children sit back down, he pretended to be serious and said: "If you want to watch the game with grandpa, you must agree to several requests from grandpa. First, you must watch quietly and no noise is allowed; second, You must also actively answer Grandpa's questions. If you answer correctly, you will be rewarded when you go home!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Grandpa, what is the reward?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You will know then. Can you do what I ask for?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes!! "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Good boy, let's watch the game together."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing Davos teasing the children with a smile, Christoya spat softly: "This old guy!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thinking of Agnes's leisurely words in her ears Voice: "It would be great if it was like this every day!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Crystal was startled, and looking at the scene of Davos and the children enjoying themselves, she couldn't help but sigh: "Yes!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ......... &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While Davos was enjoying family happiness in the royal stand, in the VIP seat not far below him, the president of the Thurii Chamber of Commerce Sostatus saw an acquaintance: "Hey, Pebaricius, I didn't expect you to come to the racing competition!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Nonsense! If I don't come to watch this race, who will cheer for my brother!" Pebaricius is Coming from a military background, he speaks more directly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I know that your brother has won the qualification to participate in the sports racing competition in the Thurii region." Sostatus immediately asked curiously: "But is his competition today?" "Today's&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   first race will be He, there is a schedule notice for the racing competition posted at the entrance of the arena. Didn't you read it?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "How can I have time to read it?" Saustatus pointed at the group of people behind him and complained in a low voice: "Look, I have so many friends to take care of and I am so busy that I have no time to take care of anything else."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Pebaricius glanced at the crowd behind him and said with a hint of sarcasm: "Lord Saustatus, you are really making friends. It's so vast, no wonder you can become one of the top businessmen in the kingdom. You should make a lot during this sports meeting."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Oh, forget about making money, it's good if you don't lose money!" Saustatus sighed: " It's not like you don't know that there was a riot in the big market outside the main port of Thurii the day before yesterday. Because they couldn't rent shops, many foreign merchants banded together and put their goods directly on the road for sale. As a result, it was blocked for two days. On every street, patrols went to drive them away and clashed with them... You know, every market in Turiyi is full of tourists these days. At that time, it almost caused a riot, causing tourists to be injured and killed due to panic and trampling. Fortunately, a brigade of The legionnaires arrived in time and calmed the situation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Afterwards, officials from the Ministry of Commerce came to me and hoped that the Turiyi Chamber of Commerce could set an example and temporarily give up some of the market's stores and rent them to these foreign businessmen to ensure the smooth progress of the entire sports meeting. What else is there to say, "This is also conducive to the further expansion of the kingdom's trade to the Eastern Mediterranean in the future, which is beneficial to our merchants"... Huh, I am engaged in business in this area, it is really unnecessary!"&#13;
