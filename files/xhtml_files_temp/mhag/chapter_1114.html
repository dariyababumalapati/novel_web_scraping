   Chapter 1114 Training Ground&#13;

 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Polus, your performance was the worst yesterday. The brothers have already started fighting the Gauls, and you are still far behind, affecting the performance of our entire team!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Oh, forgive me. It's his first time on the battlefield. It's normal to be scared." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I...I'm not scared, it's because the strap of my leather sandal is broken."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "That's a good excuse."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It's really broken. !"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "That's your fault too! It has been stipulated in military law for a long time that soldiers must take good care of their own equipment. Shoes are also one of the equipment. If you don't check it properly, you can't blame others if something goes wrong during the battle. Fortunately yesterday Your action is to attack. If you retreat, you will be caught by the enemy and no one can save you." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It's hard to say. During the retreat, Polus might take off his shoes and run faster than us. ."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You -"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay, don't say anything! Except for lagging behind at the beginning, Polus performed very well in the subsequent battles. Brothers, think about the first time we went to the battlefield. At that time, Bipolus was not much better, so don't blame each other. Remember! Our team is a whole. Only by helping each other and fighting side by side like brothers can we defeat the enemy and make ourselves better. Let's survive!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The captain is right! Let's drink together to celebrate yesterday's victory and the fact that no one of us was injured!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Do it!!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   the soldiers shouted, drinking up the wine in the glass, pretty The young waitress came quickly to pour them drinks.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Suna, have you considered it?! Marry me, and when I retire, come with me to Thurii! That's the greatest city in the world!..." A soldier said his heart out loud, relying on alcohol. talk.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The other soldiers immediately began to boo.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the waitress was a little shy, she had been exposed to the public to make a living. She had experienced a lot of this. She said softly: "Captain Nikapalos, I heard that you have a rule that soldiers are not allowed to get married while serving."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, Nikapalos was facing his soldiers, so he said sternly: "There is indeed a rule, but you can get engaged first. I heard that several families in our residential area have already been engaged to the soldiers in our military camp."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   " Yes, yes, you can get engaged first!!" The soldiers at the table cheered loudly, while the soldier who said he wanted to get married was smiling stupidly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The waitress was not too panicked. She moved her big eyes flexibly and turned to look at the kitchen: "I can't make the decision on such an important matter. This has to be decided by my father." The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   tavern owner was cutting meat in the kitchen. He had been paying attention to what was going on in the restaurant, and immediately shouted in blunt Greek: "No!" After saying that, the sound of the carving knife colliding with the cutting board became louder.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A soldier laughed and said: "Coladas, who told you that you were drunk last time and insisted on holding Suna's hand, which offended your future father-in-law." "When did I&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   hold Suna's hand? "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hand?" Koladas looked confused.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You were drunk at the time, so of course you don't remember it. The captain was afraid that you would be detained, so &#13;
      he told everyone to hide it."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing that what he said was serious, Coradas glanced at every teammate, including The captain was shocked when he saw the "really" expressions on their faces, and finally looked at Suna sheepishly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Suna had already hid in the kitchen.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Suna, this guy dares to bully you, let me teach him a lesson for you!" A man stood up from the table next to him and said loudly, but he was a soldier from another team.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This is between me and Suna. It's none of your business. Get out of here!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Coladas, they say you are the most powerful soldier in our unit, but I'm not afraid of you! Let's compete today. Whoever wins, Su Na belongs to!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Come here, you will be beaten to the ground in a while, don't cry!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just when the two soldiers met and the surrounding comrades were booing, the two soldiers But the squad leader quickly stopped him loudly: "Stop it, do you want to be punished by the military judge?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the military judge was mentioned, the soldiers' excitement suddenly felt like a can of cold water was poured on them. Almost everyone here In more than a year of military life, we all had the experience of being punished by him, so everyone sat back down and drank quietly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, Koladas was still a little unwilling and said angrily: "Boy, let's have a good competition at the next company football match to see who is better!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "A competition is a competition, whoever is afraid of whom!" The soldier was not willing to give up. He responded weakly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a small disturbance subsided, the tavern was still full of laughter and excitement.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the soldiers drink and relax here, they will wander around the streets of the civilian area and go to various shops to buy some daily necessities they need. However, they must rush back to the military camp before the sun sets to participate in the squad leader's roll call. If they are late, they will inevitably They will be punished, whether it is cleaning toilets, feeding livestock, boiling water in bathrooms, cleaning streets... it is all hard and tiring work, so under normal circumstances, soldiers will return to camp on time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;.&#13;

 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Most of the credit for the construction of this flat and wide stone road that Maximus rides on horseback belongs to the soldiers of the Border Corps. The construction of the road was also carried out by the military training of the Border Corps. In part, during more than a year, the legion commander took a lot of time to let the soldiers build this road.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Four months ago, the avenue connected Florentia, and just last month another avenue connected three military camps and finally connected to the port city of Pisay. However, that avenue, which is undoubtedly more than ten times longer, is Tens of thousands of laborers were recruited by the Etruscan Alliance, and under the command of engineers sent by the Theonian Construction Department, they worked together to complete it, all for the purpose of better ensuring and enhancing border defense.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The training ground is not far from the military camp and adjacent to the civilian area. It is a flat, flat grassland that has been trimmed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Dozens of hard wooden stakes as tall as a person were erected on one side of the grassland. Under the supervision and guidance of the team officers, the heavy infantrymen, armed with long shields and bayonets (or short swords), repeatedly practiced poking at the wooden stakes. Stab (or slash).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the other side of the grassland, there were many targets erected, and the light infantry were practicing bows, arrows and javelins.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In front of the target at the far end, there was a man wearing a purple and red crowned helmet throwing a javelin. He ran a few steps, roared, and threw it with all his strength. The javelin flew 50 meters and passed through. Through the thick wooden target.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Behind him stood several men who were also wearing high-ranking officers' armor, cheering loudly. The other soldiers seemed to be used to it, and no one cast a curious look.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even though Maximus couldn't see clearly the face of the javelin man, he knew that it was Hasdrubal, the commander of the Border Legion. This legion commander from Carthage always liked to leave the field personally in training and set an example first. So he was respected by the soldiers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus jumped off his horse, readjusted his helmet and breastplate, and walked straight towards the light infantry training ground.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The armory keeper who was guarding piles of javelins and arrows saw Maximus' arrival and immediately took the initiative to greet him: "Good morning, Lord Maximus!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After yesterday's battle, were the weapons consumed a lot? ?" Maximus asked bluntly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "There is no waste, sir." The custodian replied: "I heard that there were not many Gauls who attacked Florentia yesterday. Our troops arrived in time. The Gauls were still looting the villages, so the team officer They directly sent a heavy infantry company to attack without using light infantry, and the battle ended quickly, and the soldiers' armor and weapons were not seriously damaged. So far, no one has applied to replace their armor and weapons."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ma. Sims nodded and asked: "Anything gained?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Two Gaulish helmets, 5 big swords, 14 wooden shields, 25 spears, 19 sets of Gaulish clothing, and they also captured Four Gauls..." The custodian paused and said softly: "Early in the morning, the financial officer came. He said, 'We have no use for these things. He wants to take them all and sell them to merchants. 'I said, 'I can't make the decision, I have to get your approval.'"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During the Persian Expeditionary Force, there were people in the mercenaries who specialized in financial management, and this position was retained until the establishment of the Theonian Alliance.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the establishment of the Kingdom, the logistics support system of the legions became more complete, and all legionnaires were citizens of the kingdom. Therefore, each legion no longer had a financial officer position, and the spoils obtained were temporarily kept by the baggage battalion, and finally dispatched by the Ministry of Military Affairs. The quartermaster will handle the matter, or call merchants to auction the loot, or transfer part of the loot to the treasury.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Part of the money thus obtained was used to provide compensation to soldiers and their families who were killed or injured in battle, part was deposited in the small treasury of the Ministry of Military Affairs, and part was transferred back to the army as a reward for the soldiers' victory.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But the Border Corps is different. The soldiers are hired and are paid monthly. The money comes from the national treasury, so a financial officer is specially set up, and the finance department sends officials to serve.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There was a dispute between the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Ministry of Finance over who should handle the spoils of the Border Legion. In the end, it was Davos who made the decision and left it to the legion's financial officer.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The reason why he did this was for safety reasons. After all, the soldiers of the Border Legion were not citizens of Theonia. Handing the soldiers' most important belongings to the officials of the Ministry of Finance could prevent the affairs of the mercenary legion from being completely handled by the Ministry of Military Affairs. , or under the control of the legion commander.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Taking charge of the spoils of war was originally the responsibility of the baggage officer, but the Border Legion was assigned to the newly established financial officer. Maximus had some objections, but he was an agent and was not a citizen of Theonia, so he could only I buried this dissatisfaction in my heart, and on the surface I got along relatively harmoniously with the financial officer.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, he said calmly: "I know this, you did a good job! After we go back to the armory and confirm the loot, you can ask the financial officer to take them away, but you must confirm the amount , and asked him to sign..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The computer was completely broken, so I had to use someone else's computer to dump out the document, and used my lover's laptop to re-upload it. The screen was too small, and it was WPS. It was very uncomfortable to use, and My eyes will hurt after a long time, so I can only endure it for the time being.&#13;
