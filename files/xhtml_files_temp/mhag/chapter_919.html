   Chapter 919 The Thebes Holy Team&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;

 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Xenophon did not agree with Agesilaus's approach of protecting the stupid general who was selfish and attempted to plunder Athens, this was Agesilaus, a king who valued friendship very much, so he had to comfort him again Said: "Now Cleombrotus (another Spartan king) has led the allies to fight in Central Greece for several months, and has not been able to make any major progress. If the battle situation remains like this, it will be a stalemate for Sparta. It will not go well. Some city-states that were originally dissatisfied with Sparta may join the Athens-Thebes alliance one after another to strengthen the forces against Sparta. By then, the Spartans may think of you again. Come."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Agesilaus did not respond to Xenophon's words. On the one hand, he did not want to see Sparta fall into such a predicament. On the other hand, he did not want to judge the performance of another Spartan king in Central Greece, thus appearing He was narrow-minded, so he changed the subject and said half-jokingly, half-seriously: "Xenophon, you are an Athenian. Do you want Athens to lose?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Xenophon said seriously: "I don't want Athens to be defeated, nor do I want Sparta to be defeated. Athens and Sparta have their own strengths and complement each other. They should not be enemies. If the two city-states unite, Then the whole of Greece can unite, and we can compete with other powerful forces in the Mediterranean."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "...a very good idea." Agesilaus looked at Xenophon and finally said.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After seeing off Xenophon, he returned to the house and saw the book on the table. Agesilaus was stunned for a while. Regarding the matter of "Sparta supporting the fugitives to counterattack Apulia", he said: Xenophon was not telling the truth because he did not object in the council of elders.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "More than 500 warships, 100,000 troops!..." Agesilaus muttered in a low voice, still a little frightened in his tone. He first heard that the war broke out in the Kingdom of Theonia, and he had invested in it one after another. The strength of the troops (the same was true for Carthage) really frightened him. He carefully calculated that even if the city-states of Peloponnese, Central Greece, and Northern Greece were united, they would probably be able to He barely made up this huge number, but Theonia was able to do it relatively easily, which made him feel scared, because he knew very well: Although Sparta is still in alliance with the Kingdom of Theonia, due to The two sides are too close to each other, and both are ambitious, and there will inevitably be a war one day due to conflict of interests. Therefore, in his heart, he hopes that Carthage will win this war. Although it is a foreign race, Persia is also a foreign race, and it is not a foreign race now. Did you work well together? After all, the current situation in the Western Mediterranean is different from the era when Dionysius dominated Sicily.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thinking of this, Agesilaus felt the urgency of time again: but as Xenophon said, Cleombrotus had led his army to fight in Central Greece for so long, and so far there had been no major progress. Going down would be very detrimental to Sparta. Should I take some action? !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;

 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Due to the plundering behavior of the Spartan generals and their subsequent acquittal, Athens went to war with Sparta and formed an alliance with Thebes. Soon there were Chios, Byzantium, Rhodes, and Eubia. ...The city-states joined this new alliance, and this new alliance was named the Second Athenian League (after all, the alliance was mainly established with Athens, and most of the city-states that joined the alliance were city-states that had formed an alliance with Athens in recent years). It was separated from the Delian League established by Athens during the Loponnesian War. The League declared that the purpose of its alliance was to protect the independence of the Greek states and resist Spartan oppression.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In order to summon and hire more soldiers to fight against Sparta, the Athenian citizens' assembly also passed a resolution to resume the collection of property taxes. In order to collect taxes more quickly and easily, the Athenian government also reformed the collection method.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The newly-established Thebes government focused all its energy on military affairs. They relied on solid city defenses to withstand the first wave of attacks by the Spartan coalition.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   With the coming of autumn, the soldiers of the Spartan coalition returned to their respective city-states to prepare for the autumn harvest. There were only less than 3,000 Spartan warriors left under the command of King Cleombrotus of Sparta. He was unwilling to The precious Spartan warriors were lost in the siege, so he temporarily retreated to Plataea.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Thebes government seized this precious truce time, mobilized the entire city, surrounded the city of Thebes, dug trenches, built barriers... and took all measures to strengthen the city's defense to defend against the next attack by the Spartan coalition. At the same time, they also actively united with the nearby independent Boeotian city-states and actively assisted them in strengthening their defenses in order to block Sparta from the territory of Thebes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, the Spartan government also summoned the citizens in the city to conduct military training every day. The person in charge was Epaminondas. His outstanding performance in the previous battles won the support of the people in the city. Recognized and respected, everyone actively participated in the training plan he formulated, and no one questioned the plan.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Epaminondas was not satisfied with just defending the city of Thebes. He realized that only by defeating the Spartans in a battle could it be possible to completely eliminate the Spartan threat to Thebes and make Thebes Usher in the real rise. Therefore, while he was training the citizens, he also made a new suggestion to Pelopidas and the others - that is, to establish an elite heavy infantry company so that it could compete with Sparta's famous King's Guard in Greece, and even He also proposed that the army should be composed of gay couples based on the high number of homosexuals among Theban citizens. He believed that it was because of the close relationship between these lovers that they could inspire and assist each other in battle. We will live and die together.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although homosexuality is highly respected in mainland Greece, an army specifically formed by homosexuals has never appeared in the Greek states before. If this proposal appeared in other Greek city-states, even Athens, it would be questioned by many people, but The emerging Theban government was composed of radicals headed by Pelopidas. They were young, energetic, passionate, adventurous, and innovative, so they realized that Ipaminondas' plan would help significantly improve the bottom line. After the combat effectiveness of the Bisi citizen soldiers, it was immediately adopted and implemented immediately.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Pelopidas and Epaminondas personally selected the citizens of the city, and soon formed a heavy infantry company of 300 people (150 couples). These soldiers were about 20 years old and were all born in Thebes. They are nobles and have basically undergone long-term training in wrestling schools. They are all tall, strong and agile.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Epaminondas began to subject them to more rigorous heavy infantry training.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;

 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In Sicily, the Carthaginian army officially began its attack on the Theonian territory.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hasdrubal led 30,000 soldiers straight north from Jela and began to attack Hena.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time, Mago personally led more than 50,000 soldiers from the Camanlina territory, entered the territory of Syracuse, and set up camp in the northwest of his territory. The target of his attack was Pala, not far from the camp. Gonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Syracuse also summoned more than 10,000 soldiers, led by general Falecus, passed through the Ixa Gate and attacked Taunis not far to the north.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The southern border of the Theonian Sicilian territory was attacked by three armies successively, but the cities of Theonian Sicily and their allies, which had been prepared for a long time, did not panic. They carried out defense in an orderly manner according to the pre-deployment.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Hasdrubal led his army to reach Hena after a long journey, he was a little embarrassed, because the city of Hena was not only built on a hill, but also adjacent to two large lakes on its north and south sides. It was difficult for the Carthaginian army to surround it, and the army could not be fully deployed during the attack, so the advantage of large numbers could not be fully utilized.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Moreover, at the beginning of the war, the administrator of Hena, Crelu, at the suggestion of Leotychides, mobilized the people and used these two lakes to dig a wider moat under the hill. It also set up obstacles for the Carthaginian army's siege equipment to approach the city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition to the 3,000 Eighth Legion soldiers sent by Leotychides to Hena, plus the citizen soldiers in the city of Hena, there were more than 5,000 troops in the city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After several days of careful preparation, Hasdrubal began to attack the city with all his strength. As a result, after a day of fierce fighting, he could not even attack the city head. The attack in the following days also suffered a failure. Due to the heavy casualties of the soldiers, Hasdrubal Drupa had to stop attacking and rest.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mago's army also encountered difficulties. The Theonian soldiers who stayed in Palagonia for several months have been building defense facilities with the help of the people of Catanai. They arranged trap areas outside the village and built outside the trap. The guard towers and trenches were dug outside the guard towers, and traps were placed outside the trenches... This was done one after another, extending southward for several miles, guarding the only link between the mountains on the south coast leading to the Catania plain. Flat lot.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In order to open this road, Mago's army suffered from traps and harassment by archers from the sentry tower. After several days, less than 1/3 of the roadblocks were cleared, but the morale of the soldiers was low.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After two days of rest, Mago finally decided to change his attack route, cross the mountains, and head for Leotini.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the east coast, Syracuse's army had already arrived at the city of Taunis, but it took them five days to build the camp. After the first siege failed, they stayed in the camp without any movement. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Satnicum, this unfortunate Volscian town was captured and occupied by the Romans last year. This year it encountered war again and was besieged by the Theonian army for nearly two months. The family members of Roman citizens, under the custody of the Theonian army, shouted to the soldiers on the city to persuade them to surrender.&#13;
