   Chapter 936 Sextus and Stolo&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Theonia defeated Rome and forced the southern Etruscan city-states to surrender, the northern city-states were also waiting and watching. They were even worried that this southern kingdom, which was more powerful than Rome, would become a huge threat like the Celts. So when the news came that Rome had been completely wiped out, the top officials of the northern Etruscan city-state could not sit still and hurriedly sent envoys to Rome to inquire about the intentions of the Theonia people. Now they can form an alliance with Theonia. , exactly what they wanted.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos put down his wine glass and looked around at the excited messengers. He suddenly remembered something and took this opportunity to say: "Consul Catamontaros, you were forcibly taken away by the Romans last year, such as Antium, Vilitre, The territory of the three cities of Satnicum has been recaptured by our Theonia. Please go back and inform the Volscian exiles in these three city-states so that they can return as soon as possible and take over their city-states again!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Uh..." Catamontaros came to Rome this time. One of the purposes was to discuss the ownership of these three towns. However, he did not expect that Davos would directly return these three towns to them without making any demands. After seeing Wolsey, he didn't know what to say for a moment. After a moment, he said excitedly: "Thank you, Your Majesty, for your selfless help to Wolsey! Thank you to the Theonians for their great help to our Wolsey! ... ...As far as I know, in order to help us retake these three towns, many Theonian warriors were injured or even died...For this reason, our Volscian Alliance is willing to donate a large amount of property to you, the king, to make up for it. The loss of Theonia! Although I know that these things cannot fully express the gratitude of us Volscians to Theonia..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After listening to this, Davos said sincerely: "Wolsi and Theonia are allies. Theonia helps you regain the lost land to fulfill the obligations of the allies. I am very grateful to the Wolsi Alliance for the gift, and I am deeply grateful. I feel Wolsi's affection for Theonia! But I think this batch of supplies should be left to the Wolsi people who have suffered from the war and are in urgent need of rebuilding their homes!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After hearing this, Catamontaros was even more moved and was about to say something. Next to him, Nemeli suddenly stood up and rushed to say: "Dear King, we Herniki people are also very grateful -"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos waved his hand and interrupted him with a serious expression: "Nemeiri, if you are also planning to donate any supplies to Theonia, there is no need to say anything. I know that in this war with the Romans, you are very important. The Erniki people suffered the most heavy losses. Not to mention rebuilding their homes, even food is quite scarce. I am afraid that even how to survive this winter will become a big problem for you! Therefore, I decided to give you a batch of food to help you first. After getting through the difficulties, if you encounter any difficulties in rebuilding your home in the future, you can come to Rome to ask for help, and the administrator of Rome will try its best to help you!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Nemeli was stunned. He wanted to say something, but he choked on his words. He just moved his lips and soon began to choke.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Cartamontaros expressed his gratitude loudly and at the right time: "The kind King of Theonia! All the people of Wolsi thank you! We are extremely honored and proud to be an ally of Theonia!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Witnessing this scene, other envoys who felt the same were also relieved. Not only did they greatly eliminate their vigilance against the powerful Theonia, but everyone was thinking: How could Theonia treat Wolsey and Hercules like this? Erniki, then when your own race becomes an ally of Theonia, I believe you will get such treatment!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As a result, the atmosphere of the entire banquet became more warm and joyful, and the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   For a period of time afterwards, Tapirus was busy negotiating with various envoys and signing alliances, and something happened during this period.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Kataimontalus returned to Volscary, he conveyed Davos's words to the Volscian Alliance, and began to mobilize the previously exiled Volscian people to return to their homes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But the people of Satnicum refused to return for a simple reason: that town was cursed by the devil, had a plague, and was no longer suitable for them!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although, the Roman administrator Asistes assured the Volscian envoy that after long-term observation by the Theonian doctors, the territory of Satnicum was safe and there would be no more plague.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But most of the Satnicum people still refused to go.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After several discussions, the senior leaders of the Wolscian League finally made the decision to give away the territories of Vilitre and Satnicum, considering that the war had caused a sharp decrease in the population of Wolsey and that the entire Wolsey territory was now vast and sparsely populated. Give it to Theonia as a small token of their gratitude to their allies for their selfless assistance! (The reason why they added Vilitre was that the Volscians were worried that if there was only Satnicum, it would be more like evading responsibility and showing that they were not sincere enough. They did not add Antium because they considered In the future, there will be close contact with the Roman territory of Theonia. Antium, as the Volscian town closest to Rome, will undoubtedly receive huge development on both sea and land. The Volscian Alliance is somewhat reluctant).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While Davos was entertaining envoys from the surrounding forces in Rome, Sextus, who had just returned to Rome and had just reunited with his family, strolled to the foot of the Capitoline Mountains.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Capitoline Hill became the acropolis of Rome because it was home to the temples of Jupiter and Juno, the main god believed by the Romans. However, in fact, the majority of Roman civilians rarely had the opportunity to go up to the mountain to worship. So did Sextus, who had been captain of the Roman squadron.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But today, Sextus saw that although there were soldiers standing guard at the checkpoint leading to the top of the mountain, people were no longer prohibited from going up the mountain. Therefore, the entire mountain road continued to have people going up and down the mountain, which seemed very lively.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the way up the mountain, Sextus met some acquaintances. They greeted him warmly. Of course, there was envy and flattery in them: "Hey, Sextus, you are back! I heard that you are going to be the commander of the legion. Well, congratulations! Your dad is also an official in Theonia now, your family is really developed now! Take care of us more in the future!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Sextus, congratulations on winning another battle. This time you will be able to get a lot of land!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Sextus, my son Titus, you know, although he is not yet 18 years old, he is already stronger than an adult. Can you let him serve in the army in advance?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sextus was so overwhelmed that he finally had to walk with his head down to avoid being recognized.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When he reached the top of the mountain, he quickly came to the location of the Temple of Jupiter. The magnificent temple in his impression had disappeared. What appeared in front of him was a large, clean and flat open space paved with marble slabs, as if all the statues of the former temple gods were gone. It was a fantasy, as if it had never existed. Only the many black cracked marbles could be associated with the tragic mountaintop fire that my father mentioned.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sextus originally wanted to come here to pay his respects, but it turned out that there were no traces of ruins here. No wonder people who went up the mountain rarely came here. Instead, they walked to the edge of the cliff to overlook the panoramic view of the Roman city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;looked around in confusion, and suddenly saw many people busy with something on the other side of the mountain where the temple of the Roman God of War Janus was, and he walked over involuntarily.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As he got closer, he saw that among these busy people were many Romans who were cleaning up the ruins, and a few Theonians who were using tools to measure the ruins and using wooden boards to record and depict them. ...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Among these people, Sextus saw a familiar figure.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Stolo!" he shouted.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stolo turned around, saw it was him, and nodded in greeting.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sextus took two steps at a time and rushed to him. Looking at this young man who was once known as the youngest and most promising among Roman civilians, now he looked haggard. He couldn't help but ask: "You... How are you lately?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stolo was silent for a moment and said softly: "I joined Theonia, there is nothing to worry about..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I heard what my father said..." Sextus said sincerely: "I feel very sorry about your father... and your father-in-law! I hope you won't be too sad!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stolo smiled bitterly and sighed: "My father was infected with the plague. This is a punishment sent by Jupiter. No one can blame him. But I heard that in the military camp of Satnicum, he was punished by Dionysus." Dr. Ya's treatment and care are very good..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "That's true!" Sextus interjected: "Not only your father, but all the Roman soldiers who contracted the plague were well treated and cared for by the Theonians, so many people were infected with the plague. Plague-ridden Roman soldiers survived!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, even as a son, I can only stay away from my father who is infected with the plague, so for this, I am very grateful to the Theonians!" Stolo said calmly without fear.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "And I heard that my arrogant relative who contracted the plague was completely cured after being treated?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You are talking about Servius, yes, he has indeed been rid of the plague and has basically recovered."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This is good news. At least my wife's sister no longer has to stay at my house, so I can be more quiet." Stolo showed a wry smile: "As for my father-in-law, I have tried to persuade him to surrender many times, but he was always rejected. He refused, and he finally set himself on fire...I was actually prepared..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Speaking of this, he couldn't help but think of the great Roman nobleman's regard and care for him in the past. He couldn't help but look sad and said in a heavy tone: "It's just a pity... His body was burned to charcoal, and there was no way to distinguish it from the other bodies. They were all identified and could only be buried in the big tomb next to Mars Square... These days, my wife goes there every day to worship..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
