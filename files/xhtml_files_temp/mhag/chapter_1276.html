   Chapter 1276: Quickly Determine Egypt.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Considering the huge threat from Theonia to Persia today, Artaxerxes relied heavily on Trebassus, who was good at conquering and fighting, so he thought for a long time and finally ordered the intelligence department not to allow it. We will pursue this matter further, but the surveillance of Trebasus must be strengthened.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On this day, while Artaxerxes was still worried about the unstable political situation in Babylon, the minister Trebassus hurried into the palace to ask for an audience with the information just returned from Egypt by the messenger.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Jie Hao died in a storm on his way to Theonia. Nectanipos launched a rebellion and was marching towards Memphis -" Artaxerxes saw this, swept away the gloom in his heart, and shouted excitedly: "Egypt There is a civil strife. This is a rare opportunity! We should take the opportunity to send troops to regain Egypt in the name of helping Nectanipos!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Trebasus reminded tactfully: "Your Majesty is wise, this is indeed a chance to regain Egypt. Great opportunity! But Nectanipos suddenly raised his troops without notifying us. He obviously had other intentions and was probably on guard against us." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   With the civil strife in Egypt, he will be of no use to us." Arta Xerxes curled his lips disdainfully, and then said solemnly: "What we need to worry about is the reinforcements from Theonia. We must send a large army before they arrive in Egypt. As long as the army crosses the Nile and captures Memphis, Egypt has become within our grasp -"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Artaxerxes paused, and then said with emphasis: "So I decided to appoint you as the military commander to attack Egypt. I hope you can successfully complete the regret that the kingdom has continued for many years. !"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Faced with the expectant eyes of the King of Persia, Trebassus immediately bent down to salute and said loudly: "Thank you for your trust! I will do my best to complete the mission and dedicate Egypt to your king!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I'm waiting for you. Good news!" Artaxerxes thought for a while and suddenly said: "If you succeed in taking back Egypt, I will marry Atossa to you."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Trebasus was stunned. After a while, he finally felt A complicated thank you and left.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Artaxerxes wanted to take advantage of the civil strife in Egypt to quickly send troops to capture Egypt. The quickest way was to dispatch troops to garrison the Babylonian court. The undead army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But in order to maintain his own security, it was impossible for him to send out this elite force loyal to him. Instead, he mobilized the army near Babylon.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As a result, it would take a lot of time just to assemble the army, not to mention the long journey from Babylon to Egypt, which would also take a lot of time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Trebassus felt that he had done his best to supervise the assembly of the army, but he did not know that the Holy Kingdom of Theonia had already made plans before the civil strife broke out in Egypt, and when the King of Persia gave him the order At that time, King Theonia had officially appointed the commander of the Eighth Army, Chalcedis, as the wartime commander of the Egyptian reinforcements.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just two days later, the four Sicilian legions and the light cavalry legion, which had already been assembled and on standby, boarded ships at the ports of Lillibe and Hadrumentum respectively, heading for Egypt.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Perhaps due to the blessing of Hades, the Theonian army did not encounter any storms during the voyage and successfully entered the mouth of the Nile five days later.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, Nectanibus had just captured Memphis and publicly announced that Pharaoh Tanib had died of illness, and issued a call for himself to take over as Pharaoh before his death.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, while he appointed himself Pharaoh and forcibly married the queen, he also sent people to massacre royal family members and close associates of the former Pharaoh. People in Memphis were panicked, and the entire Nile Delta was also in turmoil.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Some city lords announced their support for Nectanipos, the "new pharaoh", while some city lords raised troops to eradicate the rebellion, and some city lords waited and watched the situation develop...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Naukratis at the western mouth of the Nile Delta is the Egyptian town with the largest number of Greek descendants. The town that has benefited the most from the alliance between Egypt and Theonia in the past 20 years, not only does the residents have a good impression of Theonia, but also many Theonia people have settled here for a long time, including members of the Kingdom of Theonia. Intelligence Department personnel, they had already convinced the officials of Naukratis City in advance, so when a fleet full of Theonian soldiers arrived at the checkpoint near the mouth of the river, Naukratis City officials and the people gathered around the Theonian intelligence personnel Under the instigation of the emperor, the city gates were opened and people lined up to receive them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When they saw the neatly dressed and majestic Theonian soldiers entering the city of Naukratis, the people not only did not feel worried, but were greatly reassured, because only a strong army can ensure safety in this turbulent period. With the protection of the Theonian army, Naukratis can naturally stay away from the war.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After only resting for one night in the city of Naucrates, Chalcedis led his army to quickly move south along the river on the second day. The route was exactly the same as that of the Theonian army that came to rescue due to the Persian invasion a few years ago. , but the purpose is completely different.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The slogan "The Theonian Allies will eliminate the rebellion and help the Egyptian people regain peace and tranquility" quickly spread throughout the Nile Delta with the help of intelligence personnel.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   You must know that the Theonian army has left an excellent impression in the hearts of the Egyptian people: they have strict military discipline, bravery in combat, and have no offense with the people... In addition, the nearly 40,000 troops led by Chalsidis are huge. , so the Egyptian towns he passed through hardly offered any resistance and opened their doors to welcome him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Theonian army went smoothly and soon approached the city of Memphis.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Nectanipos originally colluded with Persia just to strengthen his own power in order to usurp the throne in the future, but he knew very well: Compared with Persia, which wanted to annex Egypt, it had been an alliance with Egypt for more than ten years and saved Egypt several times. Theonia in distress is a better partner.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So he originally made up his mind: after he usurped the throne and the situation became slightly stable, he would immediately send an envoy to Theonia to express his friendship, continue to form an alliance with it, and use its power to defend against the Persians.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It's just that he never expected that the Theonian reinforcements would come so quickly, but he didn't panic too much. He believed that he was the only Egyptian royal bloodline today, and that it was a fact to succeed the Pharaoh. When he showed goodwill Next, Theonia can only admit that he is the next pharaoh and form an alliance with him, which is the best result.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So, he sent an envoy to the Theonian army that was marching towards Memphis.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Unexpectedly, Chalcedis, who had already received instructions from King Davos, did not see the envoy he sent and directly detained him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At first, when Nectanipos received no reply, he thought that the envoy had an accident on the way, but many of the envoys he sent never returned, and he began to feel uneasy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the previous Persian invasion of Egypt, he had fought side by side with the Theonians and had a deep understanding of the combat effectiveness of the Theonians. He had no idea whether his army could defeat the Theonians. Too much confidence, not to mention that he had just occupied Memphis, and the officials appointed by the former Pharaoh did not completely surrender to him. Once he went to war with the Theonian army, he would probably be in big trouble; but on the other hand, he was deliberately planning After waiting for so many years, he finally took advantage of this great opportunity and sat on the throne of Pharaoh.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But once he abandons Memphis and leads his army back to his home base, it is equivalent to admitting that he is a traitor without asking for it. Not only will his prestige be greatly lost, but the position of Pharaoh will also be usurped by others...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Right in Nectani While Persia was hesitant, the Theonian army had quickly approached the city of Memphis. He also wanted to make a last-ditch effort, standing on the top of the city and facing Chalcidius, the commander of the Theonian army whom he knew below. Si shouted loudly and sincerely expressed his willingness to form an alliance with Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Only then did Chalcedis give a clear response: "Pharaoh Tanib is a hero of the Egyptians (referring to the fact that he overthrew the Persian rule in Egypt) and the best friend of the Kingdom of Theonia. , His Majesty Davos issued an order, 'The rebels must be severely punished and the murderer of Pharaoh Tanib must be executed, so that the Egyptian people can feel at ease and peace can be restored in Egypt!'" At&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   this time, Nectanipos finally understood that he and Dai War between Onia is inevitable.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, an Egyptian river fleet originally stationed in Naukratis and a dozen small warships from the Theonian First Fleet also arrived in the river near Memphis.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In this way, the Theonian army basically completed the siege of the city of Memphis. It was no longer possible for Nectanipos to lead his army to evacuate Memphis. He could only strengthen the city's defenses in a hurry, and at the same time sent messengers to risk rushing into the city. After breaking out of the siege, he rushed to the city of Per-Rameses (built by Pharaoh Rameses II and now the residence of Nectanipos) for help, and sought support from the Persians.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Chalcedis did not give Nectanipos any time to buffer, and launched an attack on the city of Memphis on the second day. Although the siege for several consecutive days caused a lot of casualties to the Theonian army, it also made preparations even more difficult. The outnumbered Egyptian rebels felt overwhelmed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The former pharaoh Tanib had been in power for 20 years, and the officials and people of Memphis were deeply affected by him. They were already dissatisfied with the usurpation of Nectanibos, and he killed the royal family members and was cruel to the officials whom Tanib reused. The persecution made everyone even more resentful. When he fully commanded the army to defend against the siege of the Theonian army and had to weaken his control over the city, some Memphis officials strengthened private contacts, and they also persuaded the city's Saint Ptah Domain monks.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the early morning of the sixth day of the siege, while the tired rebel soldiers were still sleeping, these officials led an army of several hundred people made up of their own guards and slaves to raid the west gate of the main city of Memphis. , because some monks from the Ptah Sanctuary were mixed in the team, the rebel soldiers guarding the city gate were at a loss for a while, and the city gate was quickly captured.&#13;
