   Chapter 934 Envoys gather in Rome&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hanno slowed down his tone and said: "Of course, regarding the issue of the Sicilian army also needing naval support, you don't have to worry too much about Pretacuba. I remember that the resolution passed by the Senate a few months ago required the construction of There are 600 warships, and 195 warships are part of them. The built warships can then be organized into a fleet and sent to the Sicilian waters to provide help to our army."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Preta Kuba was still cautious and did not respond to the little kindness shown by Hanno at this time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, it made Ace Aruba and other neutral senators secretly nod, thinking that Hanno was still able to take the overall situation into account in the face of a war related to the survival of Carthage.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "But don't forget, we are building warships, and the Theonians are also building warships. Their shipbuilding level is not much worse than ours, and in terms of naval warfare, we have not gained any advantage so far. , I'm right, Annobas."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Annobasi nodded awkwardly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "So -" Hanno emphasized his tone and said loudly: "We should not place our hopes on the navy. Our hope of victory still lies in the army. The more than 100 troops led by Lord Mago have consumed a large amount of Carthage's treasury gold and silver. Thousands of troops. What I want to remind you of is that due to the blockade of the Latium coast by the Theonian fleet, we are not sure how the war situation there is progressing now, but we have conducted sea battles with the Etruscans in the north. I still got some news from the merchants.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the fall of Rome, the Roman army lost consecutive battles. It had retreated to several small cities west of Latium and was being besieged by the Theonian army. I am afraid it could not hold on for long... Once Rome was completely destroyed, the Theonian king It is possible to lead a large army and go south to land in Sicily. By then..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hanno paused deliberately, taking in the uneasy expressions on everyone's faces, and then said solemnly: "So Lord Mago must capture Katanay and Naxos as soon as possible. There is not much time left for him! Although He once wrote to us that he removed most of the Carthaginian generals because they lacked the ability to command operations. We do not understand the situation on the front, and we respect his decision, but I want these to be removed The Carthaginian generals are all excellent citizens of Carthage as we know them. Are those ignorant and backward Numibians better than them?! If this is really the case, why do we rule Numbia? , instead of Numbia ruling our Carthage?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You are absolutely right, Lord Hannuo!!" Many elders felt relieved and expressed their support loudly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hanno continued calmly: "I propose to select a group of outstanding Carthage citizens and let them go to Mago's tent to obey orders, and Mago will arrange their duties according to their abilities. In this way, We don't have to worry about Mago accusing us of interfering with his command and causing a setback in the battle. At the same time, it also gives the young people of Carthage a chance to wash away their shame."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Agree to Lord Hanno's proposal!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Master Hanno is so thoughtful. As long as young people are given a chance, they will be much better than those lowly Numibians!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Only Lord Hanno dares to accuse Lord Mago of his prejudice against the citizens of Carthage. We absolutely support your proposal!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The elders expressed their approval one by one.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Preeta Kuba's heart was filled with bitterness and excitement: Damn Hanno, not only did he create a big problem for Lord Mago, but he also aroused the senators' dissatisfaction with Mago!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, he saw Hanno throw a smile at him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the same time that the Carthaginian Senate was fiercely debating the new fleet to reinforce Sardinia, Davos had returned to Rome.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Because the news that Rome had been completely conquered had been discovered by the surrounding racial forces who had been paying close attention to the war, they sent envoys one after another and gathered in Rome, hoping to meet King Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the entire Theonian army had been in Satnicum territory for 20 days, Davos completely lifted their confinement when he left, and only transferred the 5th Legion and a Roman brigade of nearly 6,000 people to follow him back. to Rome.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   That night, Davos held a banquet at the Roman City Hall to entertain envoys from all parties.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The war in Latium has just ended. The city of Rome is in dire straits and the people's lives are still relatively difficult. It is impossible to prepare a more sumptuous dinner to entertain all distinguished guests. I apologize to you with this glass of wine!" Davos said in The host of the banquet raised his wine glass high and said apologetically.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, this is not true!" Cataimontalus, the Volscian envoy and the consul of Polivenrum, said loudly: "Destroying Rome is the best for us Volscians. Hospitality! When the Romans launched a massive attack on the Volscian territory, Your Majesty risked going to war with Rome's ally Carthage and sent reinforcements without hesitation to help us, the Volscians, repel the Romans and avoid the danger of war. The Romans have ravaged our territory for a long time... The Volscian city-state alliance sent me as an envoy to Rome to meet with the king. I want to tell you that all the Volscian people regard the Theonians as us. Friends forever, so this first glass of wine should be my way of expressing my heartfelt thanks to you on behalf of all the Volscians!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As he spoke, he stood up, picked up a full glass of wine, and was about to drink it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Unexpectedly, another guest next to him stood up hurriedly and said loudly: "Wait a minute! This first glass of wine should be given by us Herniki people to you, the king! If there is no king, you will personally lead the army and risk huge losses." Risk, expedition to Rome, and completely defeat the Romans, I am afraid that our Herniki people... have been destroyed! Your Majesty, you and Theonia are the biggest saviors of all our Herniki people, our Herniki people Will always be Theonia's loyal ally!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing this, Davos was moved, and he said emotionally: "Dear guests, we in Theonia were able to defeat Rome, thanks to the full help of Wolsi and the Herniki people! I just made a mistake Little mistake, I should have drank this first glass of wine with you two. Thank you for our joint efforts to defeat the Romans! I also wish that the alliance friendship between Theonia, Volsey and Herniki will last forever! "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Davos finished speaking, he brought the wine glass to his mouth.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, you are right, this glass of wine should indeed be drunk by Theonia, Wolsey, and Herniki first!" Katymontaros said meaningfully, and then raised his head and drank it in his hand. of wine.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "In Latium, Herniki will fully support Theonia!" Herniki messenger Nemeri assured loudly, and also drank the wine in his hand.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the envoys of other forces saw this scene, their faces changed slightly or they were thoughtful, but they all understood the fact in their hearts: Theonia was not only powerful militarily and defeated Rome, but it also obtained Wolsi and Hercules in central Italy. With the full support of the two major forces of Ernici, coupled with the Latin city-states that surrendered to it, Theonia's strength in central Italy was even stronger than Rome in its heyday.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So, when Davos filled up the wine again and greeted all the envoys present, they all stood up and congratulated Davos respectfully.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Dear Majesty King Davos!" A messenger wiped the wine stains from his mouth and asked loudly: "Now that Rome has been conquered by Theonia, is Theonia ready to support a new Rome? Or is Theonia ready to support a new Rome? Make it a sub-state of Theonia?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as he finished speaking, Davos learned from the interpreter beside him what he said and the identity of the speaker - the Sabine envoy from Keate.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos knew that the relationship between the Sabines and the Romans was complicated. At first, the Roman founder Romulus led the Latin exiles to this desolate land on the banks of the Tiber River, and they survived by robbing nearby Sabine towns. During the most difficult period, Rome and the Sabines had many wars over the past century, but many Sabine tribes actively or passively merged with Rome and became Roman citizens.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, Davos said seriously: "Rome, Weiai, Gabi, Fidenae...these towns were taken by the citizens of Theonia with their lives and blood, and they will all become the Kingdom of Theonia." part! The kingdom will fully help the Romans and Latins who have become citizens of Theonia to rebuild these territories and turn them into wealthy towns in central Italy, allowing them to live a prosperous life."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After hearing these words, the messengers looked at each other, each with a different mood.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty the King of Theonia." Envoy Aqui couldn't wait to ask: "In the past, Rome relied on its strong force and often invaded surrounding races, threatening everyone's safety. Will Rome join Theonia now? Or are you still like before, provoking wars everywhere and greedily wanting to gain more territory?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as he said this, all the envoys pricked up their ears and focused their attention on Davos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos saw their expressions in his eyes and understood in his heart: The Aequians were asking about Rome, but in fact they were asking about what would happen next for the Kingdom of Theonia, which suddenly broke into central Italy and had already established a foothold here. What kind of foreign policy should be adopted towards neighboring forces, and this is probably the issue that all envoys are most concerned about.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He smiled slightly and said loudly: "If you understand the history of the founding of Theonia, you will find that Theonia has never actively invaded the territories of other city-states and races. Usually other forces invade Theonia first. , some city-states even broke their promises, suddenly tore up their alliances with us, brazenly invaded the territory of Theonia, and killed the people of Theonia, which led to the anger of our Theonia, angrily counterattacked, and destroyed them. wipe out.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
