   Chapter 1281 Farewell to the King (1)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But the Samians never expected that under the orders of Sekerian and other fleet commanders, about 80% of the crow warships in the Theonian fleet would dock on the nearby beach. The fleet infantry disembarked from the warships, gathered nearly 15,000 people, and surrounded the city of Samos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Samos people on the top of the city were all shocked when they looked at the densely packed and well-equipped Theonian soldiers outside the city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, Sekerian sent a messenger into the city of Samos and threatened the Samians aggressively at the meeting: immediately surrender to Theonia. If they dare to let go of the Asia Minor fleet, they will be punished even if they surrender. !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The threat of the messenger frightened the MPs of Samos, reminding them of the rumors that Theonia destroyed Tegea in the Greek War, so they did not dare to fight back against the arrogance of the messenger, but said politely: The council needs time to deliberate on this important issue before making a decision.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Sekerian learned about the performance of the Somers Council from the messenger, he also discussed with Midorades and Stefankas, and then reached an agreement: he would lead the first fleet and the 15,000 The fleet infantry continued to surround the city of Samos; while the second fleet and the third fleet immediately headed north to Milia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before nightfall, Sekerian even made a decision: tow all the warships onto the beach and only send clippers to take turns to keep an eye on the port of Samos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This was a very bold decision. The Asia Minor fleet could take advantage of this favorable opportunity to rush out of the port and quickly escape back to Halicarnassus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, the generals of the Asia Minor Fleet did request Samos to leave the port, but the Samos Council was still arguing over the request of the Theonian envoy during the day, and did not reach a unified opinion. How could they dare to let the Asia Minor Fleet Leaving would bring disaster to themselves, so they found various excuses to evade it. The Asia Minor fleet generals themselves had different opinions and did not have a strong request to leave immediately at night, so they left it alone for the time being.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Early in the morning of the second day, Sekolian led the warships of the First Fleet to re-blockade the port, while the troops on the shore, led by the infantry commander of the First Fleet, Sesefidorus, cut down the trees on the island and used some of them to They came to build a camp, and part of it was used to build siege equipment, and they put on a posture of being ready to attack the city at any time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The citizens of Samos who surrendered in the city saw all this and felt even more uneasy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Also uneasy were the generals of the Asia Minor fleet. They were once again making demands and wanted to leave the port quietly at night, and their attitude was very determined.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, after the Samos people tried to be perfunctory but failed, their attitude became tough: they refused to open the port water gate and let them leave.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The two sides almost clashed because of this.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Compared with the riots that almost occurred in the city, Sekerian outside the city was also not relaxed, because the crew members had already finished the rations they carried. The dinner was fish and fish soup that the fleet crew had made great efforts to catch from the offshore in the past two days. Barely enough to satisfy hunger.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But Sekerian was confident of victory. Not only did he trust Midorades and Stephachus, but he had fought side by side with Leotychides. He firmly believed that the current commander-in-chief of the Greek coalition would definitely win. I will seize this opportunity to win and come to my aid in time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   To this end, he spent the evening visiting tents, encouraging the crew and fleet infantry to persevere.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Early on the morning of the third day, the hungry Theonian crew still drove their warships out to sea and blocked the port of Samos. If the Asia Minor fleet rushed out of the port at this time and fought a decisive battle with the first Theonian fleet, the outcome is still unknown. , but the Asia Minor fleet was afraid that the enemy's warships would outnumber its own, and chose to continue to huddle in the harbor.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The delay of the Samians was more like leaving their fate to the gods. Of course, they hoped that Persian reinforcements would arrive in time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But at noon, a huge fleet sailed from the north, completely disappointing the expectations of the Samos people.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leotychides not only sent a fleet to transport food, but also asked the second, third, and fourth fleets to carry the soldiers of the entire Tenth Legion. At one time, thousands of warships gathered near Samos The sea area not only shocked the Asia Minor fleet in the port of Samos, but also demonstrated its powerful naval strength to nearby coastal city-states such as Ephesus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   8,000 soldiers of the Tenth Legion and the remaining fleet infantry all landed on Samos Island. Nearly 30,000 Theonian soldiers lined up outside the city, covering most of the mountains and fields of Samos Island. Not to mention the astonishingly powerful ballistae.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The people of Samos were completely desperate. It had never faced such a powerful enemy since its establishment. Athens, which had once attacked it, could not compare with it at all. Therefore, the Theonian soldiers made a quick decision before they even started to attack the city. --surrender.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The generals of the Asia Minor fleet in the port learned that the Samians had betrayed Persia, and immediately led the crew to launch a riot in the port, trying to seize the water gate so that the fleet and warships could rush out of the port. It's better to be captured immediately if you fight.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Unexpectedly, after the self-aware Samos surrendered to the Theonian army, they immediately invited the Theonian army into the city and asked them to personally deal with the tens of thousands of Asia Minor fleet crew members entrenched in the port.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not long after, the rebellion launched by the Asia Minor fleet was crushed by the Theonian Tenth Legion, which quickly arrived. So far, the Theonian army and fleet had hardly suffered any losses, and captured the entire Persian Asia Minor fleet. This was an astonishing battle. An exciting victory, it not only means that Theonia has temporarily gained maritime dominance in western Asia Minor, but also caused changes in Persia and Theonia, which had roughly equal naval strengths. Theonia and its allies Start taking advantage.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The destruction of the Persian fleet in Asia Minor and the surrender of Samos had a great impact on the Greek states in western Asia Minor. They suddenly realized that they had lost the protection of their navy, and most of the Persian garrisons in various regions went to Phrygia. Their amazing strength The Theonian fleet could land and attack any western coastal city-state at will, so Ephesus, Miletus, Chios... and even Lesvos and many other Greek city-states in Asia Minor changed their previous alienated attitude and sent envoys one after another. Expressed friendship to the Theonian fleet and the landing Theonian army, and some even asked them to release some of the crew members of the Asia Minor fleet. After all, most of the crew members of the Asia Minor fleet came from these Greek city-states.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leotychides led the coalition generals to convene a military meeting in Ilion with Sekerian and several other Theonian fleet officers, as well as the Athenian admiral Cabrias. After discussion, it was decided that as long as Asia Minor The Greek city-states regularly provide a certain amount of military food and supplies to Theonia and the Greek naval and land coalition, and open ports to the coalition fleets, then Theonia and its allies will promise not to attack these cities and release crews from these cities. &#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the notice given to the envoys of the Greek city-states in Asia Minor, there was no requirement for them to surrender to Theonia, because Leoticides, Sekerian and others knew very well that only the land army in Asia Minor could be completely defeated. , so that these wallflowers can completely fall to Theonia!&#13;

 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the early morning of January 364 BC (the 30th year of the Kingdom of Theonia), Turiyi had just celebrated the New Year People in the inner city get up early to clean the roads in front of their homes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After breakfast, some people rushed to the river port in the city, while others waited by the road near the house.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   By the time it was daylight, the avenue from the foot of King's Hill to the inner city pier was already crowded with men, women, and children.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just when everyone was looking forward to it, cheers of "Coming! Coming!" came from the front, and the people suddenly became excited. Everyone was pushing and pushing. If there were not soldiers on the roadside to maintain order, I am afraid it would have caused quite a stir. of riots.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   after awhile.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Groups of palace cavalry appeared in the middle of the road. They wore black breastplates, purple cloaks, and red crowned helmets. They rode majestic horses, all of them majestic, and marched forward in neat formations.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After them, King Davos of Theonia appeared in front of the people. He wore a golden crown, gorgeous armor engraved with the pattern of Hades waving a double fork, and a thick woolen robe. , riding a big black horse. Although his hair was gray, his back was still straight, his eyes were sharp, and he looked energetic.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Walking side by side with him was his eldest son, Clotokatax, now the consul of the kingdom. His achievements in Thurii in recent years are obvious to all, especially the successful hosting of the Theonian Games last year. , his ability to govern has been fully recognized by the people of Thurii, which is why they did not worry much when they learned that King Davos was going to personally conquer Persia, a great country in the east.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Following the two men was Apox, the second son of King Davos. He was already a famous scholar in the kingdom, and was promoted to the deputy dean of the School of Mathematics in Theonia Academy last year. He is famous for his wisdom in the world. Although he is a member of the public in Li Yi, he appears mysterious in the eyes of ordinary people because he has been in the academy for a long time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Next to Apox is Anteblis, the third son of King Davos. Among the children of Davos, he is the most popular among the people of Thurii, not only because he is a rugby star, but also because of his personality. Active, willing to interact with civilians, and very down-to-earth.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Next to Antbris is Eunice, the second daughter of King Davos (although Cynthia is only Davos's adopted daughter, she is gentle and virtuous and is recognized by the people of Thurii and regarded as Davos's. The eldest daughter), as a woman, she should have traveled in a carriage like her mother and sisters, but she chose to ride a horse. She loved sports competitions and had a personality similar to that of a man. She was also loved by the people of Turii, especially the As for Turiyi merchants, she has taken over the Kristoya Chamber of Commerce in recent years and is even more popular among them for her capable and decisive style.&#13;
