   Chapter 1301 Izam's Persian Experience&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I heard my tribe specifically mention these things, and my eldest brother even said gratefully, 'Without their help, his tribe would not have become the largest tribe in Dukya.' ! Thank you, Your Majesty! Thank you, Mr. Mariji!" Izam saluted the two of them sincerely.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mariji quickly avoided it and said in a calm tone: "It's nothing, everything is for the kingdom!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Izam, I went to Duqia, why don't I look like you anymore?" Davos said jokingly : "Don't say any more words of thanks. What I want to hear now is the details of your adventure to Dukya! Come on, everyone, sit down and let's talk slowly."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The guard moved the wooden chairs and several people sat down. Afterwards, Izam began to narrate: "...After I followed Chalcedis's vanguard to Egypt, I boarded a ship arranged by Lord Mariji in the city of Naukratis and actually belonged to his Persian friend. The Egyptian merchant ship entered the port of Issus, and then followed a caravan arranged by the Persian merchant in advance to the plains of Mesopotamia-" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Your Majesty, this Persian merchant is the one I told you before. Mazayas who have been there," Marij interjected.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Have you sent anyone to contact him after we got here?" Davos asked with interest.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, I sent someone to look for him in Issus... but unfortunately he was not at home. I heard from his servants that he was still doing business near Babylon and has not returned..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos noticed that Marij was there. There was a hint of hesitation in the answer, so he said in a gentle tone: "Persia is his mother-state after all. It is understandable that he does not want to completely surrender to us, but we cannot forget the help he provided. After the victory, we will definitely Give him a reward!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Thank you, Your Majesty!" Mariji breathed a sigh of relief and immediately expressed his gratitude.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Izam, please continue."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "...I followed Mazayas's caravan and headed east along the north bank of the Euphrates River. It went relatively smoothly at first. Later, it was said that our army entered Egypt and some Greek coalition forces landed. News from Asia Minor had reached Babylon, and the king of Persia issued an order for military mobilization. The order in the entire towns along the Euphrates River became somewhat chaotic. The caravan I was in was intercepted by town checkpoints several times, and those temporarily formed The army wanted to seize the supplies carried by the caravan for various reasons. Although Mazayas had some means, he was able to let them go in the end. However, after discussing with me, he decided to replenish enough water in Corsoti City. After that, I headed north in advance.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Unexpectedly, the order on the Mesopotamian plain became even more chaotic. Not only was the caravan I was in robbed, but several people were killed and injured. I had to pretend that I was sent by the Dukyan people. The messenger claimed that the supplies carried by the caravan were used by Dukiya to form reinforcements... It may be that the prestige established by our Dukiya people in defeating the Persian king's personal army that year made the Persians fearful. After that, the caravan We were no longer harassed by the garrisons in those towns, and we passed through Caine, Lalisa, Mespira relatively smoothly... and arrived in the Dukya Mountains smoothly -"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this point, Izam still looked a little proud, Then his tone dropped again: "When I met my people, I realized that my father had passed away 10 years ago. My eldest brother and several other brothers died in the war against the Persians. Now... My second brother Remi is now in charge of the tribe. Although he was surprised by my sudden appearance, he was not very surprised. According to him, his tribe has been working with Mazayas and other caravans over the years. With relatively close contacts, I learned some things about Theonia through them, and even learned that not only was I not dead, but I also became a high official in the kingdom... Because Lord Mariji has kept these caravans for The tribe provided help. My second brother has a good impression of the kingdom. He is very happy that I can arrive in time, otherwise he does not know what to do next.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Because the Persian king has sent an envoy to Dukya, asking each tribe to send warriors to participate More than half of the tribes have expressed their consent to the kingdom's war. Only some tribes, led by our tribe, did not take a stand because of my second brother's opposition. As a result, the Dukeya Tribal Conference did not make a final decision for several days in a row... "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Didn't the war between Dukiya and Persia win? How come the Persians can still instruct Dukiya so casually?" Davos was a little confused.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Izam hurriedly explained: "Your Majesty, I heard Remi say that although Dukiya won that war, Dukiya's losses were also great, and the Persians made concessions afterwards, such as reducing the annual tribute. Jin, placed some disputed areas under the management of the Dukyan people... So the Dukyan tribes were still willing to rely on Persia in the end, and because the Persian oppression of the Dukyan people was reduced in the following years, both sides The tense relationship has improved a lot. This time, the Persians also promised some benefits in order to get Dukea to participate in the war, which attracted many tribes...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, since the Xokant tribe is now Dukea The most powerful tribe in the mountainous area, my second brother objected, and it was difficult for the entire Dukya tribal alliance to reach a unified opinion. The Persian envoy led several tribal leaders to persuade Remi for several days, and even threatened in the end, 'Even if the Xokant tribe refuses to participate in the war, other tribes will participate, but after the war, Persia will treat the Xokant tribe differently!' This put Remi under a lot of pressure.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I asked Remy I relayed your Majesty's plan. Although he was a little tempted by your Majesty's promise (to allow Dukea to be independent after the victory of the war, and even the kingdom will fully support him to become the king of Dukea), he was still worried, so I asked him again. After a detailed analysis of the military strength of Theonia and Persia as well as the current situation in the Mediterranean, he reluctantly agreed and decided to agree to the request of the Persian envoy to lead the army to participate in the war." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Your second brother persuaded other Dukya tribes to participate in this plan. ?" Marij interjected.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I have also raised this issue with him, but he was very cautious. He told me that among the tribes in Dukya, there are two large tribes that have bad relations with the Xokant tribe. If he ventures to contact other tribes secretly, tribe, it is difficult to guarantee that the news will not leak out. Once the Persians know it, the Xokant tribe will be in danger, so he will not take the risk, but he has gathered all the young people in the tribe, More than 5,000 people came to participate in this war. This force plays an important role among the tribes of Dukea. At the critical moment, he only needs to secretly persuade the tribes who are closely related to the Xokant tribe to act together. I believe he can definitely control the outcome of the war. It has a great impact!" Izam said confidently.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos smiled and praised: "Very good, your second brother is calm and considerate, which makes me believe that our cooperation with the Xokant tribe will be successful! Isam, you will follow your tribe later." We arrived at Taposakus together?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, after the Dukea Tribal Conference reached an agreement, each tribe successively formed an army to go to Mesopotamia. Although the soldiers led by Remy were the largest, they were the first to set off. , I dressed up as a warrior of the Kesuokant tribe and followed my second brother all the time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   We left the Dukya Mountains and went south along the Tigris River. The towns along the way must have received orders to provide us with a certain amount of food supplies. After we arrived at the city of Opis, the Persians did not allow us to go south any further. , we stationed ourselves near Opis City, waiting for other Dukea tribe armies to come and join us.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During this period, every day, armies gathered from towns in the upper reaches of the Tigris River went to Sitake City further south of Opis City to meet up -"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Izam said this, Davos suddenly sighed softly, a little sighing. Said: "Opis... Sitake... we also went there back then..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mariji immediately answered: "Your Majesty, this time you have enough time to visit these familiar Persian towns again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   looked at him and said with a nostalgic tone: "Mariji, the first time I saw you was in the Media area, right?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mariji&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   said excitedly: "Your Majesty, more than 30 years have passed, and you still remember it so clearly!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thanks to the blessing of Hades, I met you when I was in danger, and my life has changed drastically since then!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I only regret that I didn't meet you earlier and serve you earlier!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Listening to Mariji's sincere words mixed with compliments, Davos nodded slowly and said softly: "It is also my greatest luck to have the help of you and Melses!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   You, please take good care of yourself. I am still waiting for you to take me around Persia after this war is over!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Yes...yes...Your Majesty, I will be a good guide..." Mariji's trembling voice was slightly choked.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos suppressed the emotions surging in his heart, and then asked: "Izam , how long have you been in Opis?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "All the Dukea tribe troops stayed there for more than two months. The reason why they did not move for such a long time is that the Persian king was waiting for the Persian army and Indians to arrive from the far east.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During this period, I also saw armies from Amelia, Taukia, and even the Kaldans..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this point, Izam's expression became a little solemn: "Later, the two The large area closest to the river is full of military camps and soldiers everywhere. There are countless troops... My relatives also wavered on whether to continue supporting Theonia. Fortunately, during this period, Greece The coalition forces defeated the Persian army in Asia Minor, our fleet defeated the Persian fleet, and Your Majesty personally led the army to conquer Canaan... These news came one after another, coupled with my persuasion, they once again strengthened their confidence. !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thank you Hanhai Huangsha for the reward! Your support is the motivation for my writing!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
