   Chapter 922 Exposed&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What did you say?!" Davos thought he heard wrongly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, we no longer need to attack the city of Satnicum, the Romans are surrendering!" Henepolis repeated happily from the side.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The reason why Davos lost his composure just now was because once Satnicum surrendered, Vilitre, which had less than 3,000 defenders, would be unable to support itself. It was almost certain that Rome would be completely destroyed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thinking that Rome, which dominated the Mediterranean in his previous life, would soon be wiped out by him, Davos seemed to be in a dream. He pressed his hands on the hard tabletop to calm down his boiling emotions, and then said in a deep voice: "Put the senior All the generals were summoned to the tent, so that they could witness with their own eyes the moment when the Romans surrendered!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aulus wore a white linen lining, a well-fitting dark red leather armor, and a bright red robe. The corner of the robe was held in the crook of his left arm, and he held a wooden scroll in his hand. The papyrus on his waist was originally wrapped with a dagger, but it had been removed by the guards before entering the tent. So, with his right hand half on his waist and his head held high, he walked firmly into Dai Dai's tent. Onia's tent.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as he entered the big tent, he saw nine people standing on both sides. Most of them were wearing black military uniforms and helmets with purple and red tassels. Aulus had led his army to fight for Theonia for several months, so he knew that wearing such The attires were all senior generals of the Theonian army, but one of them was wearing the attire of a Roman officer and also had a Roman appearance. Aulus felt a little familiar, and he immediately thought that this person might be often scolded by the soldiers. Sextus, the commander of the Roman rebels, looked at him deeply.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sextus met his gaze without hesitation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aulus immediately calmed down and focused his eyes on the center. The king of Theonia was also in military uniform, sitting on a wooden chair, looking at him with a serious expression.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aulus immediately bent down to salute and said loudly in Greek: "Dear King Theonia, I am the envoy sent by the Roman dictator Camillus, the Roman legionary commander Aulus Comenenius. Kossus, by the command of Lord Camillus, I present to you our surrender."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Daves heard this, he was quite surprised: "A letter of surrender?! Regarding surrender, are you not going to put forward some conditions first and then surrender after reaching an agreement? Just surrender directly like this?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The reason has been explained in the letter. You will know after reading it." Aulus raised the wooden scroll in his hand.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hennipolis hurriedly stepped forward to take the scroll and handed it to Davos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Davos started to take a closer look, Olivers suddenly chuckled and said to Geogris beside him: "Look at the way the Roman envoy walked into the tent, I thought he was here to tell us that the Romans were going to He was ready to fight to the death with us, but he unexpectedly came to surrender!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Considering the mood of the Roman envoy, Geogris did not answer.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Matonis said: "Yeah, it's really disappointing! The siege was about to start, and the brothers were still looking forward to breaking through the city and making achievements!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aulus turned a deaf ear to the words of the senior generals of Theonia teasing him. He just stared at Davos in front of him while suppressing the tension in his heart. It was not that he and Majors had not considered it first. Send envoys to negotiate, put forward some conditions, and finally reach a surrender agreement, which is more beneficial to them and less likely to arouse the suspicion of the Theonians. However, the plague in the city spread too quickly, and within one day of their deliberations , and many soldiers were sick, and the negotiation method was undoubtedly too time-consuming. When the surrender agreement was reached, I am afraid that most of the people in the city had fallen. How could they hide it from the Theonians, so they chose This trick was used - writing a letter of surrender directly in the name of Camillus, which could speed up the progress.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "So that's it." Davos put the letter on the table, looked directly at Oros, and said, "You have run out of food. Many Roman soldiers lost their fighting spirit and actually went to Camillus's residence to make a fuss. Asking to open the city gates and let them go home... Aulus, is the situation in Rome really that bad?! In my impression, the Romans have a tough character and will not give in easily. When the Celts occupied Rome, Didn't you also hold on to the Capitoline for half a year, why did you surrender so easily this time?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The Gauls' invasion was completely different from this one. The brutality of the Gauls made all the city-states and races of Latium angry, and you Theonians-" Oros glanced at Sextu Si, he sighed unwillingly: "I have to admit that you have been able to make many city-states surrender to you, including a large number of civilians in Rome, so that we can only fight alone now... there is no hope..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aulus' words came from the bottom of his heart. Davos looked at him and asked: "How is your dictator Camillus? I heard that he fainted and became ill during the battle and has already fallen into a coma. "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aulus said calmly: "Lord Camillus is not in a coma, he is just quadriplegic and bedridden, but his mind is clear, he can speak, give orders, and command and deploy without any problems. This letter was dictated by him. Written below."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Henepolis suddenly asked from the side: "You said in your letter that there is a shortage of food in the city, but judging from your complexion, it doesn't look like there is a shortage of food?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aulus raised his head again: "I have just introduced that I am the commander of the army. If the commander of the army is hungry, how can he command the soldiers to fight?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Don't your Roman army generals suffer hardships together with the soldiers?" Georgris couldn't help but ask.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The Roman Senate has such a rule, but whether to comply or not depends on the Roman general's own cultivation. This man belongs to the Cominenius clan, which is the largest noble in Rome!" Sextus said suddenly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Oh, I really didn't expect that there was a Roman in the big tent of Theonia." Aulus said contemptuously, but in his heart he was thanking Sextus for explaining himself.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "In this letter, Camillus believes that I can give the surrendered Roman soldiers a good way out." Davos pointed at the letter with his hand, smiled, and said: "Since you belong to Comenenius Clan, I believe you have heard from the mouths of those Roman family members how we deal with the surrendered Roman nobles. For a large clan like Cominenius, it will be completely dismantled and scattered to various parts of the kingdom. Are you okay with that?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aulus's face changed, but he immediately said proudly: "I believe that people from our clan can survive well wherever they go!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos nodded slightly and asked: "About the surrender, have all the soldiers in the city already known and fully accepted it?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "They...did not express their objections explicitly."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Davos heard this, he had no doubts in his mind. He raised his eyes and glanced at the generals on the left and right, and then said in a louder voice: "Okay, let's talk about how to accept your surrender and post-war settlement."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aulus was relieved.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos left Thormedes and Henepolis behind and began negotiating surrender with Aulus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Martonis, Olivers and other legion generals walked out of the big tent, they began to talk about the surrender of the Satnicum garrison. They all looked regretful and excited: the regret was that they could no longer lead their troops to capture Satnicum in person. In the city of Nicoum, they accomplished the feat of completely defeating the Romans; they were excited because the Roman war was about to end, which meant that the army would soon go south to fight the powerful Carthaginians.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, Matonis saw the captain of his legion, Ctesus, hurried towards the tent, and behind him was the director of the medical camp and the senator of the Senate, Stacey Cordas.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ctissus, who looked anxious, also saw his commander and rushed over quickly. Before Matonis could ask, he whispered a few words in his ear quietly and urgently.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mattonis's expression suddenly changed, and he immediately looked at Stacey Kordas and asked: "Are you sure?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "With just one person, we can't be completely sure." Stacey Kordas said seriously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Let's go, follow me to see His Majesty!" After Matonis said this, he turned around and rushed towards the big tent.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the other generals didn't know what happened, they felt that something important had happened, and they all followed closely.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aulus wanted to end it quickly, so the negotiations progressed quickly. When everything was finalized, he breathed a sigh of relief and stood up quickly, preparing to say goodbye to King Davos.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty!" Matonis quickly walked into the tent, rushed to Davos, and whispered a few words to him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos' originally smiling face was suddenly covered with a layer of frost. He tapped his fingers on the table, making a quick and powerful sound of "tap-tat".&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a moment, he looked at Aulus with sharp and majestic eyes, and his voice was slow and powerful: "Aulus, there is a plague in Satnicum!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What?!" Henepolis, Thormid and others exclaimed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aulus is like falling into an ice cellar.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It turns out that after Aulus, Megios and others completed their conspiracy, they considered that Aulus could speak Greek, so they asked him to serve as the envoy. As a great nobleman of Rome, Aulus believed that even if it was a false surrender, it would not undermine the prestige of Rome. It must be carried out in accordance with traditional Roman etiquette, otherwise the enemy would be suspicious, so he selected a group of soldiers who had been found to be in good health as his entourage. , and strictly requested them not to talk about anything about Satnicum after entering the Theonia camp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When these people were allowed to enter the Theonian camp, Aulus went to meet Davos, and this small group of Roman soldiers were left near the camp gate, ushering in the onlookers of many Theonian soldiers. This makes them nervous.&#13;
