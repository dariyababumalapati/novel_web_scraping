   Chapter 1092: Observations on the Craty River&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Standing on the side of the boat, Haka could see the long, encircling white breakwater at the mouth of the Craty River from a distance, with countless ships passing through it, as if it were a busy beehive.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As the boat approached, I discovered that there were multiple water gates open on the breakwater.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "All cargo ships must pass through the water gate on this side and obtain the wooden sign of the dock before they can enter; and the water gate on that side of the breakwater is responsible for inspecting the cargo ships leaving and handing over the wooden sign of the dock. If there is no wooden sign, they will You will be fined. But large ships like ours do not need to pass through the breakwater gate, but go through the wide water channel in the middle and accept inspection by patrol boats..." the captain explained to Haka in detail.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Why do we have to make the entire cargo ship inspection process so cumbersome? This will greatly delay the time for cargo ships coming to trade to enter the port for delivery!" A subordinate of Hakka pointed at the long queue of cargo ships outside the water gate in front and asked himself objection.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It is much better to let them delay for a little time outside the water gate than to swarm in, causing congestion to the entire Kraty River estuary and wasting more time. You can see that there are many boats outside the water gate. In fact, there are even more boats in the estuary. If there is no effective management, it will be a disaster!" the ship owner said seriously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You are right." Haka nodded in agreement.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The owner directed the large passenger ship to bypass the long queue of boats in front of the breakwater and enter the middle river. There&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   was a large wooden platform floating in the middle of the river, with a wooden house built on it. The front of the wooden house was high The flag of the Kingdom of Theonia was flying.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The passenger ship took the initiative to dock in front of the platform. An official came out of the wooden house. He asked the ship owner a few questions and checked the documents submitted by the ship owner. Then he looked surprised and jumped immediately. Boarding the passenger ship, he strode up to Haka and saluted respectfully: "Salute to you, Lord Haka!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka also nodded politely in return.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The news we received is that the passenger ship you are on may not arrive until tomorrow, so neither His Majesty nor the Senate may be prepared today. I must send a speedboat to reach the inner city. Terminal notice, so I have to ask you... to wait a little longer here, I hope you can forgive me!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The official said apologetically.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "That's no problem.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Haka agreed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "We were originally unwilling to come, but your king agreed to come after several letters of invitation!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now we have come all the way from Iberia, but you don't let us in. Is this the way to treat guests?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since we are not allowed in, then we will not go in and go back!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Back to Iberia!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ..." Standing at the entrance of the cabin was Hasdrubal, who was swaying. He was shouting and seemed very angry.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the port official heard this, he was a little panicked and was about to continue explaining.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You don't need to worry about him, he If you drink too much, let's follow the procedure and do whatever you want!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Haka comforted him and winked at his men.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Soon, his men and several strong soldiers helped Hasdrubal into the cabin.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The passenger ship docked on the wooden platform. Behind, the port official stayed with Haka, chatting with him to spend the waiting time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka stood on the bow, watching a ship from the front, rear, left, and right without stopping. As I paddled by, I suddenly discovered that the location of the estuary ship command center is very clever: directly in front is the outlet, diagonally to the left and right are the breakwater and water gate, the north bank is the entrance to the main port of Turii, and the rear leads to Turii In Yicheng, all the ships gather here, so the river mouth ship management office has 10 fast boats with eye-catching signs on the sails, which are responsible for directing and dredging the river.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the ships come and go frequently and the river is noisy, Haha Ka felt a little uncomfortable, but he did not hide in the cabin again, but asked with interest: "How many cargo ships enter the mouth of the Kraty River every day?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "On average... there are about 5,000 ships.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The official thought for a while and said: At most, it can reach tens of thousands, but that is usually during the Hades celebration."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Haka had estimated this, he was still shocked by the number: "So Multiple ships?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Of course, this is only the number of cargo ships entering the mouth of the Kraty River, and does not include ships in other ports on the Subali coast. For example, there is a large fishing port not far north of the river mouth, with thousands of ships arriving every day. Fishing boats go in and out there, providing fresh seafood to the people of the entire Turiyi region; and there is a port just north of the fishing port dedicated to transporting livestock; south of the river mouth, the original naval base of the 1st Fleet has now been transformed into A port was created specifically for public transportation. Many residences in the former naval base have been transformed into hotels, which are overcrowded every day. There are more than a thousand passenger ships coming in and out every day...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   and the cargo ships entering and leaving the Kraty River Estuary mainly supply people's daily life. Required commodities, such as wine, olive oil, cloth, wheat..." The official spoke in detail. Seeing that Haka's expression seemed a little confused, he specifically explained: "Sir, the reason why these ports in Thurii are... If you are so busy, you can't feed Turiyi otherwise."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Why?" Although Haka had a guess, he still asked for more details.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Because the population of Turii is too large. According to statistics from the Household Registration Department at the end of last year, the city of Turii alone and its surrounding areas have a population of about 300,000, while the population of the entire Turii region exceeds 400,000. There are also more people in the Mediterranean Which city can be as big as Thurii!" The official's face was filled with pride, and he continued: "But such a large population consumes a lot of materials every day, including grain, olive oil, wine, meat, fish... ...Wait, almost all items transported by cargo ships use 'tons' as the basic recording unit. The grain, olive oil and other materials produced in the Subali Plain and surrounding areas are far from enough. It requires the entire kingdom, and even It is supplied by the entire Western Mediterranean.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Moreover, the city of Thurii has many wealthy citizens. They not only need to be well fed and clothed, but also have higher demands on life. Therefore, many precious commodities are shipped here from other areas of the Mediterranean. For example, spices, gorgeous cloths and exquisite gold and silver jewelry from Persia, perfumes and cosmetics from Egypt, ivory from Africa, marble from mainland Greece... That's why so many merchant ships come to Turii every day. , As a result, our original main port can no longer accommodate it, so we can only build docks on both sides of the river to meet the demand..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Listening to the official's story, looking at the corner of the main port on the north bank of the Krati River on the left, The masts are like a forest, the rafts and oars are like the ground, and there is no trace of the color of the sea water at all.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka couldn't help but recall the scene of the Carthage port in the past. In his impression, even when Carthage's maritime trade was at its most prosperous, it was far from the scale of the Thurii port today. It was not only the result of meeting the needs of a huge city with a population of more than 400,000, but also a display of the comprehensive strength of a powerful kingdom, which made Haka even more convinced that the decision he made at the beginning was correct.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The two were talking when the noise around them suddenly became louder.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The river official glanced back and immediately beamed with joy and said, "Master Haka, the boat to greet you has arrived!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka turned his head and looked back, only to see a large ship coming upstream. Its hull looked like It seems to be made of two warships spliced &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;together, with a wooden building standing in the center above...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   a two-headed dragon!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Such a term immediately flashed in Haka's mind, but it was obvious that this ship was different from the former Carthage navy flagship: it had a black hull and red wooden buildings. The two bows did not collide with each other. Two wooden statues were tilted up, like dog heads; on the railing walkway around the wooden building stood palace guards dressed in velvet and purple robes, with the Kingdom of Deolia flying on the towering mast. banner.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the Western Mediterranean War, the Ministry of Military Affairs considered building a special ship for King Davos to facilitate him to ride on patrols or lead troops on expeditions. Otherwise, it would be too crude and crude to take a passenger ship or warship every time like before. It is not in line with his noble status as a king.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the shipwrights received the task, after many discussions, they finally decided to build the king's ship based on Carthage's two-headed dragon warship. Considering that this ship would frequently enter and exit the Craty River, the entire warship would also be built. The size has been reduced a bit.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is the image that finally appeared in Xaka's vision. Although it has not had many sailing opportunities since its completion and spent most of its time docked at the dock in the inner city, it has long been a household name among the people of Thurii. Therefore, the ships in the river tried to move to both sides, and the entire central waterway soon became wide and smooth.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The ship soon stopped next to the passenger ship that Haka was on, and then a wooden ladder was set up. The person who walked onto the passenger ship was a middle-aged man wearing a white Bolton with black patterns embroidered on it. He had a slender figure. , elegant temperament.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, the river official immediately came up to him, saluted respectfully and said: "Salute to you, Lord Henipolis!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The middle-aged man smiled and saluted back: "Thank you!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He is Henipolis... Haka, of course I have heard about this Theonian senator who has been following King Davos all year round.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just when he was looking at the king's confidants, Henepolis came to him with a smile on his face: "Lord Hakkar, welcome back to Thurii! I am Henepolis, the secretary of King Davos. , on behalf of His Majesty the King and the Senate, come to greet you!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I have read "The War in Southern Italy" written by Lord Hernepolis several times. It is very exciting! I have long wanted to meet you and have a good chat. When I saw it today, it turned out to be just as I imagined&#226;&#128;&#148;" Haka paused intentionally, and then said with emphasis: "Gentle and elegant, he is worthy of being a historical scholar!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
