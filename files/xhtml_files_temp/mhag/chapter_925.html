   Chapter 925 New changes in the city of Rome&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The pavement in the neighborhood was filled and compacted, sewers were dug on both sides, and the road was widened enough for two carriages to drive side by side. Walking on the road gave me a sense of solidity that I had never had before. The houses in the neighborhood are being gradually demolished (the reason why the houses here are being demolished with great fanfare is because the civilians living in Laventine are basically allocated housing close to the city center. In addition to the Temple of Diana, this city area, It is basically empty, so it is easy to renovate). After the rubble and tiles are cleared, the houses here will be planned and built, and there will no longer be the crowded and mixed scene before.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stolo's eyes swept over this unrecognizable neighborhood and looked at the brand-new roads. He couldn't help but sigh in his heart: The ghetto in the west of the city had tortured the Romans for 10 years. Every year, the Senate held many debates on transforming it, but 10 It has not changed at all in the past year, but under the rule of the Theonians, it has completely changed in one month. Although they have taken advantage of some wars, they have to say that the Theonians People's decision-making and execution skills are indeed very strong, and they really want to improve the lives of the Romans...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thinking back to what Maienas said, Stolo's heart seemed to be no longer so entangled. Walking through the slums, he saw some people gathered in front of the arena, most of which were the relocated Dioni. The citizens and a small number of Romans were busy under the command of two priests wearing white robes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stolo knows what they are busy with. It is said that the birthday of Hades, the protector of the Kingdom of Theonia and the Greek god in charge of law and the underworld, is coming soon. Theonia celebrates this time every year A grand celebration was held in his honor.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ten days ago, the Roman administrator Asistes announced that Rome would also hold a celebration of Hades. Stolo didn't feel much about this. Rome used to be a city-state that believed in many gods, and foreign gods were not. There are many, Etruscan, Sabine, Wolsi... there are even many new ones. But this incident not only cheered the citizens of Theonia who had recently moved to Rome, but also received positive responses from the Temple of Diana and many Roman civilians. This is a bit strange.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, after careful analysis, Stolo felt that this was reasonable: as far as he knew, after the priests of Hades came to Rome, they were gentle and friendly to the Roman civilians, often providing free medical consultations for them, and actively improving their lives. People in need provide help... Therefore, although the temple of Hades has not yet been built in Rome, there is only a simple Hades altar, but more and more people are going to worship him, so when they hear Hades The Dis celebration is about to be held, and these Roman people are also very active.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   According to the announcement issued by the city hall, on the day of the celebration, not only the believers will solemnly worship Hades, but also according to tradition, some slaves in the kingdom who have performed well in peacetime will be given freedom. More importantly, those who joined Dio in this war The names of the Roman soldiers who died in the battle on the Nea side will be engraved on stone tablets and enshrined in the Temple of Hades. Their souls after death will be protected by Hades... These practices have naturally been welcomed by the Roman people and slaves. Great concern.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What's more, there will be a rugby match after the celebration: according to the announcement, each Demo in Rome must send a team to participate, in addition to Viai, Gabi, Fidenai... and other towns directly controlled by Theonia , will send a team to participate. You can imagine that it will be a grand game. Although most of the participants in the game are Theonian citizens who have moved to the Latium area, there are also some Roman civilians who like novelty and excitement, so the Mars Square is very lively these days, with rugby teams formed in various Roman Demo districts. Active training is going on there.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   To be honest, even Stolo himself is a little excited. He wants to come to the arena to watch the game. Want to see what this rugby sport, which is popular in the Kingdom of Theonia, will be like in the official game?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stolo stood in the distance, watching the group of people working together to erect a tall statue in front of the entrance to the arena, and then began to fix the base.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The statue is of a man with thick black hair and an extremely strong body. He is holding a football in his hand and making a throwing motion. The gold foil attached to his body shines in the sunlight.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is the Hades that the Theonians believe in? ! Although Storo was a little curious, he did not get closer to take a closer look. He squinted for a while and then turned away.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Going further, the streets become a bit crowded, because most of the people going back and forth are pack cars. Those going east are full of wheat that has just been harvested and have been basically shelled, and those going south are already full. Holding bags of flour.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   September came, and the farmland harvested. The Roman people who had joined the Kingdom of Theonia, according to the previous agreement with the city hall, harvested the wheat in their newly allocated land, handed over 2/3 of the harvest, and kept the rest. (Since the Theonian army previously occupied Rome, these farmlands are logically the spoils of the army, but Asistes considered winning the hearts and minds of the Romans, stabilizing order, and at the same time in order to reduce the continued pressure from the city hall. These Roman people who have belonged to the kingdom have provided food and material assistance. This decision was made after careful consideration. This will ensure that the Roman people will not only be self-sufficient in food before the next harvest, but also save a fortune in purchasing wheat seeds. fee (this suggestion was approved by Davos). Not only could these Roman civilians get all the harvest from their original fields (if they had fields before), but they also got this extra income for free. Naturally, they were overjoyed and even more envied. What's more, after that, this fertile land belongs entirely to himself, and he only needs to pay a very small land tax every year, so these days Rome and its nearby towns occupied by Theonia are enveloped in the joy of harvest.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Within a few days, the city hall once again gave the Roman civilians a surprise. The notice posted clearly told them: funded by the city hall, they also specially found several water mills that Theonia engineers worked day and night to design and build. It has been completed and flour can be ground for free for the citizens of Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, making a water mill is far less time-consuming and labor-intensive than what was stated in the announcement: the materials are readily available, and so many siege engines were discarded after the attack on Rome; engineers and carpenters are also readily available, and Davos brought more than 500 people. team of engineers, which does not include the engineering battalions of each legion; the technology is readily available. The water mill was developed more than 10 years ago by Matikris, the deputy dean of the School of Mathematics at Theonia Academy, and has become a Large public facilities are very common in cities across the kingdom; all that is needed is whether administrative officials can take these into consideration for the people in time. Assiskes not only considered them, but also immediately started to implement them, and finally completed them just after the harvest. Construction of water mill.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Asistes had served as the administrator of many cities in the kingdom. He understood the people's sentiments and knew that although a bumper harvest was a joy, shelling wheat and grinding flour was a time-consuming and torturous task.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before water mills appeared, Greek people used stone mills to grind flour. The thick stone rollers had to be pulled by horses or donkeys. In order to prevent wind, rain or birds from pecking, it had to be done in a relatively closed hut. And a dedicated person will be assigned to take care of it. The "crunching" sound made by the constant friction between stone rolling and stone grinding is not only unbearable for people, but also for livestock. They will refuse to work, and sometimes go crazy, causing injuries. Therefore, for slaves from wealthy families, guarding the mill was the greatest punishment. Therefore, Asistes believes that the launch of the water mill will make the Roman people more deeply identify with the Kingdom of Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What is a water mill? When the Roman people saw this announcement for the first time, they were surprised. After all, Rome was an inland city-state, mainly based on agriculture, and commerce was not developed. In the past, it had little contact with the Kingdom of Theonia in the south, and the civilians were open to the outside world. The world knew even less, and it was normal not to know about this new invention that had become so popular among the people of southern Italy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, since the Theonians took over Rome, they have gradually won the trust of Roman civilians through a series of practical actions. Therefore, many Romans drove pack trucks filled with wheat grains to the riverside of Mars Square (Dionysus Square). Nian engineers inspected the river section near the city of Rome and found that the Tiber River at Tiberina Island had a faster flow due to the diversion of the island in the middle of the river, which could better promote the water mill, so several water mills were built there. Here), they were pleasantly surprised to find that this magical device could keep rotating over and over again. Not only could it grind flour, but it was also very efficient. The quality of the flour produced was good, and no one needed to be there all the time to take care of it. There was no need to worry about tiring out the animals, so soon word spread from ten to ten, and the Roman people in the city, either carrying burdens or driving pack cars, lined up at the riverside of Mars Square every day, just like Same now.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   People who had just returned from the Mars Square riverside were loudly boasting about the magic of water mills to those who were about to rush. Some people even opened their flour bags to let others see the fruits of their labor, which made those people even more impatient. Want to rush to the river.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hearing these civilians exclaim from time to time: "No wonder Theonia is so powerful, even the flour-grinding tools can be designed so magically!..." All of them looked proud, and Stolo felt a surge in his heart. Sadness: I'm afraid it won't be long before the Rome that raised them will be completely forgotten by them!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stolo speeded up his pace home, and when he came to Sirio Hill, his mood improved again, because people kept saying friendly hello to him: "Stolo, you came back so early today!"&#13;
