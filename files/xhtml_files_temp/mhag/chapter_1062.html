   Chapter 1062: Giving Grace&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hearing this, Davos didn't even blink. He had been assassinated several times over the years, and had many failed assassination plots uncovered. He was somewhat used to it. He just asked lightly: "Who? "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Some citizens of Roman origin, mainly former Roman nobles living in Thurii, according to the information currently obtained, the organizers may be Servius, Phrius, Aulus, Minucius... ...It is clear that Lentulus is also involved..." Aristelas said slowly in a tone without any fluctuation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When he heard this, Davos showed a hint of surprise: "Manlilius Lentulus, son of Publius?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, Your Majesty. It was through Lentulus that the slave in the slave camp learned about these things." Aristelas remembered something and emphasized: "That slave was also a Roman emperor. Noble."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Oh?! It seems that these former nobles in Rome are not all short-sighted. There are still people who can see the current situation clearly and recognize the Kingdom of Theonia. Therefore, this slave must be heavily rewarded and greatly rewarded. Promote it, but you must also protect him. You go to Laphias with my warrant and ask his slave management office to grant this slave freedom in advance."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes." Aristelas asked again: "Your Majesty, should you arrest these rebels immediately, or lure them... and then catch them all?" Aristelas said this, which seemed a bit rash. But the reason why he asked this question was because Davos had personally been in danger several times in the past (the assassination at the Hades celebration more than ten years ago and the assassination at the Temple of Diana in Rome a few years ago). It seemed risky, but In the end, great benefits were achieved.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos tapped his fingers on the table, pondered for a while, and then said slowly: "It has only been a few years since the war. Now the kingdom needs stable development. The Romans, Phoenicians, and Sashas in the kingdom need to The Monet people... also need time to integrate into the kingdom. If this happens at an influential gathering like the Greek Scholars Conference, it will have a very big impact, and the situation will be difficult to control by then!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos said so many words, obviously to remind Aristelas, and then he said in a deep voice: "Quickly mobilize the manpower, investigate the whole matter, obtain conclusive evidence, and then cooperate with the Tuliyi Inspection Division to arrest We must arrest and not let any gangster go, but we can't unjustly accuse good people either!&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "yes."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos asked again casually: "Where are you going to start?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aristelas said without hesitation: "I decided to interrogate Lentulus first, because he is a good breakthrough point."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then, Aristelas briefly described how Lentulus leaked the matter.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After hearing this, Davos actually sighed and said: "Such an important event requires precise planning. These people are far worse than Dionysius back then! I agree that you will interrogate Lentulus first, but you must also Considering Publius's feelings&#226;&#128;&#166;by the way, has Publius had any contact with these people?&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aristelas understood the meaning of his words and said truthfully: "Judging from the monitoring so far, nothing unusual has been found, and according to my judgment, he should not know about it yet."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos pondered for a moment and said: "Let's do it...you go and inform him to come to my place now."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Publius received the notice, he was reprimanding his eldest son Lentulus at home. He felt a headache: since the family moved to Thurii, this son had become more and more rebellious and did not attend the Thurii school. Study hard and fail the civil service examination. It was finally arranged for him to work as a scribe at the Turii City Hall, but he didn't work well and often hung out with the old Roman nobles. He refused to listen to any advice, and today he proposed to move out and live alone. , so angry that he lost his temper again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When he learned that the king was going to summon him, Publius didn't dare to neglect, and immediately set off for the Hill of Kings. Along the way, he was thinking: Why did King Davos summon him so late?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a while, I was thinking: My eldest son is now older and so rebellious. Should I find a marriage for him, which might make him calmer...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Publius's residence is in the western outer city. Even if he is a senator, he has to show Davos's warrant to the city guard before he can enter the inner city (because it is difficult to freely enter and exit the inner city at night unless are special circumstances).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Publius was thinking a lot along the way, but his pace did not slow down, and he soon climbed to the Hill of Kings.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos went out in person and welcomed him into the living room.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Lord Publius, have you had dinner?&#226;&#128;&#157; Davos asked with a smile.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "have eaten."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Then come and have a drink with me." After Davos said this, the servant brought the wine that had been prepared.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This is a new wine product that the Olipis family has put a lot of effort into, and it has not yet been sold to the outside world. I heard that you are fond of drinking wine. Please taste it carefully and see how it is different from their previous wines. Give it to them. Comments."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Publius had no choice but to suppress his doubts and took a sip. Then his eyes lit up: "This wine... is not very sweet, and is slightly sour. It tastes good!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It seems that after Orpheus came out of prison, he no longer had political interference, concentrated on research, and made good wine again!" Davos smiled and raised his glass: "Publius, you are the first Welcome to my place as a guest for the first time!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Publius raised his glass and after taking a sip, he heard Davos say: "How many years have you been the administrative aide-de-camp of Thurii?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Publius answered truthfully: "Your Majesty, it has been more than two years."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Two years..." Davos put down his wine glass, thought for a while and said: "Lucias told me several times that your performance as administrative lieutenant was very outstanding! As far as I know, you have been a long-term As a Roman municipal magistrate, you have rich administrative experience. It can be seen that as long as you are familiar with the system and laws of the kingdom, you can make great achievements. The other senators who joined the kingdom with you are not as good as you in this regard. I think you are fully capable of serving as the town chief executive independently!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Publius heard this, his heart moved and he began to look forward to it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Davos raised his glass again, he quickly raised his glass in response.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "If you can do things, you must dare to do them!" Davos said meaningfully: "I remember that you served as the administrative adjutant of Thurii, and you were also in charge of the inspection department."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, Your Majesty.&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Today, my palace herald received definite information that some people in Thurii are plotting to assassinate me at the All-Greek Scholars Conference. What do you think should be done?&#226;&#128;&#157; Davos said softly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There is such a thing! Publius looked shocked, and immediately made a solemn statement: "Your Majesty, please send Aristelas to assist me. I will notify the Thurii Inspectorate to arrest these people, and then conduct strict interrogations. Once verified, they will be sentenced to death. !&#226;&#128;&#157;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked at him and said in a deep voice: "According to Aristelas, these people are the old Roman nobles headed by Servius, Aulus, and Phryus. Your son Lentulu Si was also involved."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   What? ! ! Publius was like a thunderbolt, his whole body was shaken, and the wine glass in his hand fell down. The bright red wine flowed all over the table. He subconsciously wanted to question what he just heard, but he saw Davos With a deep gaze, he couldn't help but break out in cold sweat. After hesitating for a moment, he stood up tremblingly and gritted his teeth and said: "Your Majesty, I don't know... No, I will arrest Lentulus for interrogation. If he is really Those who participated in this treason should be severely sentenced... or even executed according to the circumstances..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Sit down first, don't be anxious. Heavy sentence? Execution?... I don't think it's that serious." Davos was satisfied with his performance, and calmly comforted him: "Since you joined the kingdom, you have been actively supporting me in the past few years. and implemented various resolutions related to Rome promulgated by the kingdom, and also put forward many useful suggestions, which reduced the turmoil of the Romans in the kingdom and accelerated their integration into the kingdom.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   For example, 'move Servius, Frius, Aulus and other former Roman army generals and officials to Thurii, and use the strong security capabilities of this central city to conduct supervision nearby. And shock them...' This suggestion comes from you. It is indeed a very good suggestion, so we can discover the clues in time. If it were in other towns, there would probably be quite a disturbance, so I absolutely believe you. Loyalty to the Kingdom!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And I also know that these old Roman nobles are very resentful towards you and are constantly spreading rumors about you throughout the city of Thurii. In order to retaliate against you, they must have deliberately approached your child and used various means to win him over. Oppose the Kingdom... You have sacrificed a lot for the Kingdom! "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After hearing Davos's sincere words, Publius couldn't help but feel a surge of heat in his heart. He wanted to say something, but couldn't say anything, and his eyes couldn't help but turn red.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos said sternly: "Theonia must not let officials who sincerely contribute to the kingdom sweat and shed tears, let alone let the tricks of these gangsters succeed. So I decided that you and Aristelas will be responsible for this time Incident. As for Lentulus... he is still a child and knows little. As long as he tells the truth about all those who instigated him, the matter will be forgotten. But... you have to strengthen the education of your children in the future. You can't just do things for the kingdom and fail to take care of your family. This is not okay. Our Theonia tradition is that the family is the cornerstone of the kingdom. If every family is stable, the kingdom will naturally be stable!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
