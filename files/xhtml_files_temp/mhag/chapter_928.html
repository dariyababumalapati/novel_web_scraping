   Chapter 928 South Italy during the Hades Celebration&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In particular, each team represents its own Demo or town, which makes the audience more inclined and more involved when watching the game. Although they do not understand many rules yet, it does not affect their ability to play for themselves. Regional teams cheered and even quarreled with spectators from other regions.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As the rugby match continued, a strange phenomenon continued to occur in Rome. The conflicts between the original Romans and the newly migrated Theonian citizens decreased, and they were even seen hooking up with each other after the game. With each other on their backs, they shouted the names of their team's players in their own languages, while the various Demo people began to quarrel...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;

 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While the Roman people were in celebration and carnival, the Theonian soldiers in the camp outside Satnicum were quite depressed: in order to prevent the spread of the plague, they had to follow orders and stay in their tents as much as possible. They cannot gather in the camp, cannot hold various competitive sports in the camp, and even have to be examined by doctors every day. This can be said to be the most boring Hades celebration day they have ever had. The only lucky one is Davos The king would go to various tents from time to time to express condolences to the soldiers. This was also the most direct contact the soldiers had with the King of Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Doctors and nurses are relatively busy. They have to wear clothes that wrap their whole bodies tightly and rush between camps every day. They are busy checking and treating without stopping, especially those Romans who are sent to suffer from the plague. The medical staff in the camp are at risk of being infected at all times, but even so, many doctors are still rushing to go because this is a rare opportunity for them to combine theory with practice.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Theonian medical staff carefully treated and cared for the injured and infected Roman soldiers, treating them like family members, and gradually moved and eliminated the hatred of the Roman soldiers towards the Theonians.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stacey Cordas, the medical superintendent, often wrote to Hippocrates, who lived in Thurii, to consult him on problems encountered in treatment.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hippocrates, who was already seventy years old, learned that a plague had broken out in Latium, and he insisted on going by boat. However, he was repeatedly dissuaded by his students and failed to make the trip. But later, his deeds of risking his life for medicine spread and inspired countless Theonian doctors.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Hades celebrations and rugby matches in Thurii were much inferior to those in previous years. The towns in the Sicilian territory were unable to send teams to participate because they were at war. The best players in other cities were often also the best soldiers. They were either with King Davos on his expedition to Latium, or they were under Alexis among the mountains of Samnai.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In addition, enemy conditions appeared in the Apulian region. A fleet carrying more than 500 soldiers landed on the coast near Barham. They held the flag of the former Puchetti Kingdom and shouted "Drive away Dioni". They rushed into nearby villages and plundered under the slogan of "freedom for the sub-humans, give the Puchetti people freedom". The people in the neighboring towns hated their banditry, and quickly summoned the citizens of the city's legion reserve to form an army of 600 people. Under the command of the Second Cavalry Regiment, which came after hearing the news, they launched an attack on the enemies entrenched in the village and defeated them in one fell swoop.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It was learned from the captives that several remaining Apulian forces might invade in the coming period. The Senate made a decision: towns in the Apulian region do not need to send teams to compete in Turii. , we must complete all matters related to the autumn harvest as soon as possible and do our best to defend.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He also asked the Ministry of Military Affairs to notify the remaining Ninth Corps and the Second Cavalry Corps to all be stationed in Pucetti's military camp. They were temporarily under the unified command of the commander of the Ninth Corps, Tagetinos, who would sit in the middle and be responsible for counterattacking from all parts of Apulia. The enemy landed on the coast.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Senate's decision aroused opposition from people in various towns in Apulia, especially in the Mesape and Pucetti areas. They sent people to the Senate of Turii to make representations to the senators and stated their position: They sent the ball. The participation of the team will not affect their full defense against possible incoming enemies.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Senate finally agreed to their request, but this incident aroused the resentment of the Apulian people against their enemies.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   With the people of Apulia sharing the same hatred, a very small number of people who were secretly connected with the remaining forces did not dare to act rashly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During the celebration, there was one thing that the people of Thurii were always talking about.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Due to the absence of King Davos, it stands to reason that the person in charge of the main temple of Hades on the day of the ceremony should be replaced by the kingdom's scepter priest Plesinas. However, Plesinas refused. He insisted that: On the day of Pluto's birthday, his descendants should preside over it, in order to please this gloomy King of the Night and allow him to better protect the kingdom in this special year.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Most of the elders agreed with this, but the actual situation is a bit troublesome. Not only is Davos not in Turii, but his only adult son Clotokatax is not in Turii either. The other children are still young. ...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After discussion, the elders finally decided that Princess Christoya would be responsible for presiding over the sacrifice.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   From the perspective of the senators, although Christoya is not a descendant of Pluto, she is the wife of King Davos and is a member of the family. Hades would not have much objection to her coming.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Why didn't you choose Agnes? The reason is simple. She is already the chief priest of the Temple of Hera. If she comes to host this ceremony, it will anger the two gods Hades and Hera. Of course, Christoya's personal influence on the senators was also the reason why the senators did not express strong opposition.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So on the day of the celebration, the graceful Princess Christoya wore a white robe and stood in front of the altar of the main temple of Hades, reciting the sacrificial words to Hades with a solemn expression. Her beautiful and noble face The clear and melodious sound became the most unforgettable image of this celebration.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;

 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While the Theonian people in Magna Graecia are celebrating celebrations to eliminate the gloom brought to them by the war, the Theonian people in the Sicilian territory are gradually facing the most difficult moment of the war.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mago led more than 50,000 soldiers to cross the mountains and enter the southern edge of the Catania plain. He built a camp between the city of Leotini and Paragonia in an attempt to sever the connection between these towns and move Paragonia away. Lagonia isolated.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, while the Carthaginians were building their camp, the Paragonian garrison and the new military camp of Catanai not far to the north of Leotini sent troops many times to harass the Carthaginian army. However, because Mago kept I was on guard and failed to achieve big results. On the contrary, once, under the interception of the Carthaginian cavalry, the harassing troops coming out of the new military camp failed to retreat in time and suffered a lot of casualties, which also made the commander of the Seventh Army, Brelu, use his troops more cautiously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, the harassment of the Theonian army also caused the construction of the Carthaginian military camp to be roughly completed after a few days. During this period, Mago was not idle. He sent thousands of Numibian cavalry to break into Kata. Niah Plains, trying to rob Catanai's people and supplies.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, Sipulos and Leotychides had already expected this. Just when the Carthaginian army invaded Paragonia, they had already mobilized all the Theonian people living outside the city to carry The supplies were temporarily moved into Katanai City.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Numibian cavalry, which failed to achieve anything, began to destroy villages, farmland and other facilities. As a result, piles of fires ignited on the plains of Catania, and villages were reduced to ashes in the fire. The only good thing was that Paragonia had successfully blocked the Carthaginian army for a few days, allowing the people on the Catania plain to complete the autumn harvest in time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The people hiding in the city of Catanai were very anxious when they heard the news that their homes had been destroyed. They gathered together and went to the city hall to petition, hoping that the army could repel these foreign cavalry raging on the plains.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the main force of Carthage is attacking from the south of the Catania plain, Leotychides has led half of the Eighth Army to retreat from Agilion to the city of Catanay.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the past few days, Leotychides went to the city head to inspect the defense situation during the day and listened to the reports from the scouts. At night, he stayed in his study, looking at the map and meditating.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Sipulus came to visit Leotychides, as expected, the Sicilian commander remained in his study.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Prosaus, there is a commotion outside, but you can still sit still!" Seeing him, Sipros said half-jokingly and half-seriously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leotychides knew what he was talking about and said in a cold tone: "War is not a fight between children. If you are bullied, you must retaliate immediately. There is no need for me to listen to the random shouting of some ignorant people."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sipulos frowned slightly after hearing this. He persuaded in a gentle tone: "You must understand the pain of the people losing their homes. Although their anger is somewhat irrational, I am afraid it will affect your soldiers. You know Most of the soldiers of the Eighth Army and Reserves are Catanai people, and their houses and fields have also been destroyed. I'm afraid this will have a big impact on their morale, right?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides looked away from the map, looked at Sipulos, and asked: "Is there anything abnormal?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I don't know about this, but I think the soldiers have some ideas in their minds." Sipulos replied calmly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You think?" Leotychides raised his eyebrows slightly. Considering that Sipulos was the wartime governor of Sicily, he needed his strong support to command the battle. The sarcastic words he was about to blurt out were forced by him. Swallowing it back, barely suppressing his emotions, he said: "I will pay attention to the situation of the soldiers, but now the Carthaginians are hoping to lure our army out of the city so that they can take advantage of their large numbers to defeat us in the field and prepare for the future. Capturing Catanai will reduce the resistance, so we must remain calm and not be fooled by the Carthaginians. Lord Siplos, do you have anything important to do with me?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
