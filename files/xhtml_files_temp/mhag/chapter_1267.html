   Chapter 1267 Archery Competition&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a while, after three arrows were shot, the audience became active again, enthusiastically guessing the outcome.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Soon, the target announcers came to the players and spectators with two round wooden boards, and the referee's voice sounded again: "26:26, both sides are tied - one more round!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After seeing the arrows on the target and confirming that the referee's decision was correct, the audience became excited: "The competition was so exciting! The two players were of equal skill. It was difficult to decide the winner for a while, which led to the extension of the game. The ticket price is definitely worth it!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Mai Galkides looked at Stasypus again, and Stasypus smiled in return, which further aroused Megakides' competitive spirit.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When another round of competition began, the audience became even quieter, and everyone's eyes were focused on the two players.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But the goddess of fate once again made a joke, and the players from both sides were tied again, but the score was lower: 22:22.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The audience was like boiling water that had just been boiled, and it was extremely lively. Especially those Theonian audiences who bought "Tino's Blessing" were extremely nervous, and they were all eagerly looking forward to the performance of their chosen players. win.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The referees and staff gathered together, discussing something with serious expressions.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There were only two players sitting quietly on wooden chairs, closing their eyes and relaxing to recover some physical strength.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The referee walked up to the two players and said loudly: "Considering that the two players have already competed for 5 rounds and shot 15 arrows, which is a great physical exertion, the referee team decided after discussion to decide the outcome with one arrow! "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Indeed, in a normal battle, if an archer shoots 6 arrows in a row, his arms will be sore and it will be difficult to pull the string. Although the players in the archery competition can continue to rest and recover, the competition lasted almost 3 hours, but 15 arrows The arrows also nearly drained both players of their stamina, causing their hit rates to gradually decline.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What if they are tied again with the next arrow?!" Many spectators asked loudly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The referee replied without hesitation: "Then shoot one more arrow until the winner is determined!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There was a commotion in the audience.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After sitting for a while, Megakides stood up expressionlessly and strung his bow. However, when he pulled the string, he clearly felt the pain in his arm. He gritted his teeth and reluctantly pulled the bow string to his ear. At this time, the left hand holding the bow was trembling slightly, and he could not stay for a long time like he did at first, and then release the string after taking a brief aim.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as the arrow was shot, he didn't feel very good, and he secretly shouted: Oops!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, he saw that his opponent's arrow was also shot out quickly. As an experienced man, he saw the strength and direction of the arrow, and he was immediately reassured.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sure enough, when the target reporter brought the board closer, the audience was in an uproar.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The arrow fired by Megacides was inserted diagonally into the lower end of the round wooden board, and it was a perfect target.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But there was nothing on the board that Stacypus shot at. He missed the target!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There was an uproar in the audience.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Megakides looked at Stasypus, but his expression seemed calm.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, the referee walked up to the players and said loudly: "Based on the results of the game, I declare in the name of the gods that Megakides won the archery competition of the Theonian Games!" After saying that, he grabbed the wheat. Gakedes raised his hands.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The audience immediately burst into enthusiastic cheers, which of course were also mixed with a lot of sighs.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And Stasypus smiled gracefully and applauded.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Next came the award ceremony. The staff led Megakides to the center of the auditorium. Under the gaze of thousands of spectators, the referee solemnly put a wreath woven from poplar branches on him and handed it to him. He had a small cloth bag woven with gold wire. Inside the bag were 20 gold coins engraved with the words "Theonian Games". The most exciting moment for the Cretan audience came: two staff members unfolded a picture of the Cretan City State. The flag was handed to the champion Megakides. Like other previous competition champions, he held the flag high and slowly circled the field to accept the cheers of spectators from all over the Mediterranean.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The officials of the Cretan athletes' delegation were all in the audience, and they were all very excited at this time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Judging from the situation in the past few days, there are many strong players in the Theonian Games, and the competition is very fierce, especially in the individual archery promotion competitions in the past few days, other Cretan players except Megakides They were all eliminated, and they discovered to their dismay: Even in the archery event in which Crete was most confident, they were not confident of winning the championship!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, today, Megakides finally defended Crete's reputation as a rich source of archers. How could they not be surprised!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So after Megakides came off the field, they immediately went up to him. While praising him loudly, they also asked him with concern.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Megakides, who was born as a commoner, was surrounded by these Cretan noble officials and was a little overwhelmed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, a voice sounded in his ears: "Congratulations, champion Megakides!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Megakides turned around and saw the opponent named Stasypus standing behind him with a smile.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This made him suddenly feel a little ashamed, and he said apologetically: "I just relied on my physical strength and luckily defeated you."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stasypus looked at him and said seriously: "You can be so outstanding at your age. There are only a few people I have ever seen who have great shooting skills!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stacypus's words inspired Megacides far more than the praise of the Cretan officials, but then he heard Stacypus say: "There are Not interested in joining us in Theonia? Excellent shooters like you are exactly what the Theonia army urgently needs!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Megakides was stunned.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before he could answer, the head of the Cretan delegation immediately retorted loudly: "Megacides is a citizen of Heracleion! He is the glory of our Crete! He will only stay in Crete. , will never join Theonia!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Oh?" Stasypus glanced at him and asked with a sneer: "If he stays in Crete, can he get a lot of land? Can he be like you? Enter the council of the city-state, hold an important position, discuss and make any resolutions? Megacides, I have read your information, you are a commoner, even if you are a champion, there is no chance of getting ahead in Crete where the nobles are in power. But as long as you come to Theonia, with your talents, you can get land, wealth, and status&#226;&#128;&#148;"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Don't lie! You think I don't know. It's not that easy to become a citizen of Theonia. It is said that you have to live here for more than 10 years before you can get it!" Silitaos reminded Mecca loudly from behind Kids.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stacypus glanced at him, and still said seriously to Megakides: "That is a decree made by the kingdom for ordinary refugees, and for a talented person like you, the Ministry of Military Affairs will definitely pay more attention to your majesty. Applying, although it is impossible for you to become a citizen of Theonia immediately, it can shorten the number of years you need to become a citizen. As long as you apply, you will soon be called into the military camp by the Ministry of Military Affairs, and after a period of training You should soon be able to become the squad leader or company captain of the light infantry brigade of the Theonia Reserve Corps. After two or three years of service, you can become a citizen of Theonia, and you may also be converted into a team member of the official legion. Officer, enjoy the respect of the people...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As the former light infantry captain of the First Legion of Theonia, what I tell is the truth. You go back and think about it carefully. If you like, you can come to me at the Military Affairs Department in Turiyi, I As a military training officer there, I can take you directly to Olivers, Minister of War."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Stacypus finished speaking, he patted Megakides on the shoulder encouragingly, then turned and left.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Perhaps it was terms such as "The First Theonian Legion, Thurii Military Affairs Department" that frightened the head of the Cretan delegation. He did not dare to interrupt during the speech, until Stasypus After walking far away, he waved his fist and shouted: "I want to protest to the Theonian Games! You are..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Megakides had never considered this issue. After Stacypus said this, My mind was in a mess for a while.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Silitaos next to him was very envious. He did not expect that he had tried his best to attract attention on the field these days, but his beautiful dream could not be realized, while this poor commoner who only knew how to train every day could not Received the approval of the Theonia officer.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing the officials of the delegation gathered around Megacides, they tried their best to persuade him, "Don't listen to Stasypus's instigation. He is now the hero of Crete, and the city-state of Crete will never treat him badly." Silitaos curled his lips unconsciously as he said words like "Wait a minute."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As Megakides and his team left the arena and returned to their base, because he was wearing a laurel wreath and a flag, the standard attire of a Theonian Games champion immediately attracted the attention of the people along the way, and they all turned to him. He paid respectful tributes, actively asked others about his winning achievements, and even took the initiative to make way for them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Cheers continued along the way, and countless envious eyes focused on him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But Megakides seemed a little preoccupied and had no intention of enjoying such glory.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After arriving at the athletes' hotel and the officials of the delegation separated from Megakides, Silitaos immediately came to his side and whispered: "Hey, Megakides, for that Theonian army What do you think about what the official said?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Megakides, who was calm and composed on the field, seemed hesitant at the moment: "I...I haven't thought about it yet..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "What else are you thinking about! How wonderful Opportunity, if you miss it, it will be gone!" Siriteos looked angry and said: "Think about everything we have enjoyed since we got here, this is simply the Elysee Paradise for athletes! Think about it again As a city, the prosperity of Thurii and the wealth of the citizens of Theonia far exceed the Athens I have been to. Compared with here, Heracleion in Crete is simply a remote small village! If I were You, I will go to the Military Department in Thurii immediately, find the officer, and ask him to help join Theonia!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
