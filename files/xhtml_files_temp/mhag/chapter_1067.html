   Chapter 1067: Mercenaries and Salaries.&#13;

 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hermeng's righteous words also moved the ministers. Even Davos was a little stunned. He couldn't help but said: "We have indeed ignored the issue of adult citizens in the past. Fortunately, we have Hermon, you remind us in time that this requires our attention. Of course we should cherish these young people, because they are the future of the kingdom! So after the meeting, the three of you, Hermon, Rafias, and Burkos, will become adults. Let's discuss together whether and how citizens should be allocated land, and come up with a draft plan, which will be discussed at the next executive meeting and then submitted to the Senate for approval." "Yes&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   , Your Majesty." The three of them A unanimous response.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay, now let's go back to the topic of 'how to reinforce the Etruscan League'. Heraclide's proposal of 'building a military fortress on the land given by the Etruscan League', I think Very good.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I think Sipulos's suggestion of 'recruiting free people and forming a border army' is also very good.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The issues mentioned by Burkos should indeed cause us to think deeply. The reason why Theonia can grow up so quickly is It is really because of our long-term and firm implementation of the law of 'accepting immigrants' that we have won the support and help of the vast number of free people, and have been unfavorable in all previous wars. Today, even if the kingdom has become stronger, we still have many enemies, and we will still encounter them in the future A more powerful enemy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And... if a pool is not filled with living water, it will become rancid; if a country is too closed and has no fresh blood, it will lose its vitality. Therefore, I do not think that the previous immigration laws should be completely stopped. , but how to solve the border defense problem of the kingdom and its allies while allowing other free people to have the opportunity to become citizens of the kingdom without making our adult citizens feel unfair, this requires us to seriously Think about it and come up with a practical and good way!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos used a slow speaking speed to summarize and evaluate the previous discussion of the ministers. At the same time, he also used a firm tone to draw a general framework for the ministers. To prevent them from going off the rails during the discussion and not getting the desired results they want.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   King Davos's words caused the ministers to think deeply.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not long after, Sipulos, who had been thinking about it, said: "Your Majesty, regarding this problem, I think it would be easier to solve it if we set different time periods for foreign free people to become citizens of the kingdom.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Join the army and guard the borders. Freemen only need to serve for 5 years before they can become official citizens of Theonia. Other freemen must work in the kingdom for more than ten years before they can become official citizens. In&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   this way, those who want to become free citizens of the kingdom as soon as possible Citizens are willing to take risks and join the border army, but free people who are unwilling to take risks or unable to take risks at all still have the opportunity to become citizens, as long as they are willing to spend time slowly in the kingdom."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos touched his chin with his hand and thought. After a while, he nodded and said, "This method is good. What do you think?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing that Davos all agreed, other ministers did not have much objection. They just discussed the details and finally perfected this article. New bill: All foreign free citizens who are recruited by Theonia and join the Theonia army can become official citizens of Theonia after serving for 5 years; other foreign freemen need to join the Theonia army in Theonia. You must live in Asia for ten years, pay taxes on time, and abide by the law before you can become a formal citizen of Theonia. If you die during this period, your family can renew the period and you can also obtain citizenship... After&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   discussing for a long time, Finally, there was a result. Everyone was just relieved when they heard that Lucias, the rotating chairman (due to the death of Cornerus and Vespa's retirement, Lysias, who was 65 years old a year ago, complained about poor health). , and wanted to resign from all positions on the grounds that he was not able to cope with the complicated government affairs. What he said was indeed true. After the Western Mediterranean War, the territory of the Kingdom of Theonia greatly expanded, the population increased sharply, and the resources became more abundant. Therefore, a large number of merchants, free Citizens, as well as envoys from some city-states and forces, flocked to the central city of Turiyi, causing a huge increase in the government affairs of the Turiyi region. The number of officials almost doubled, and they still felt that there was not enough manpower. But Davos After repeatedly trying to persuade him to stay, he finally resigned from the post of chief executive of Thurii Region and still served as the rotating chairman. In fact, many elders regarded him as the head of the five rotating presidents.) said: "Your Majesty, now we A new immigration law has been established and it has been decided to recruit freedmen to defend the Etruscan border and the border of our Iberian territory, so how many people need to be recruited?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked at Alexis.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alexis had already considered this, and he said without hesitation: "I have said before that the northern border of Etruria requires about three to five thousand people. Considering that there will continue to be casualties in the process , also need to be constantly replenished. Temporary recruitment also takes time to train. It is better to recruit the number of people in a legion at once. This will also make it easier for us to better train them with legion tactics. When they join forces with the regular legion of the kingdom in the future, Command is more convenient.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And the Iberian territory also needs a legion to better protect the safety of the people in the territory. If the allies have reinforced a legion to defend the kingdom's territory but the number of soldiers is still small, I am afraid the people will We are dissatisfied with this.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It would be best if we recruit another legion to prevent a sudden invasion of large groups of enemies. It will be too late for the kingdom to carry out military mobilization. This recruited legion can be used first to buy us some time..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Lucy When Ass heard this, his face became a little unhappy: "Three legions, more than 24,000 people, this is a huge number. Has Lord Alexis ever thought about how much salary the kingdom will pay for this? !"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alexis was a little confused: "Salary? There is no need for any salary. After these free people become soldiers, they eat and live in military camps. After completing their service, they can receive rewards from the kingdom, become official citizens, and receive land. , do we need to give them extra money?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Lysias, who has served as the administrator of Thurii for many years, explained calmly: "A foreign free citizen living in the kingdom, as long as he is hardworking enough, he can earn 100,000 yuan a month. He can earn at least 15 drachmas. By the time he becomes a formal citizen of Theonia and gets land in a few years, he has already saved a large sum of money and does not need to borrow a loan from Christoya Bank. You will be able to have money to build a house, buy wheat seeds, buy livestock, and maybe even buy another slave, and your life will soon stabilize. Not to mention these free people, even the public slaves of the kingdom, Lord Rafias , Do you also want to pay them some wages in your slave camp?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yes, but very little." Rafias replied.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "But at least there is." Lysias said slowly: "I heard that there was a very strong young slave in the slave camp of Thurii. Every time he did more work than other slaves, he gained a lot of honors. As an extra bonus, he saved all this money, and when he was free, he actually went to the slave market and bought a female slave to be his wife..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "This is true. This slave is named Wenram. He worked extremely hard and was always rewarded. Therefore, he only stayed in the Turiyi slave camp for three years. The Slave Management Office granted him freedom last year." Rafi Yas said with a smile: "Because he has been a slave since he was a child. It is said that he has never gotten along with a woman. He always listened to other slaves talking about that in the slave camp and was very curious, so he made such an impulsive move. Something."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After he finished speaking, many ministers smiled.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Lord Alexis, you see, even slaves are paid, not to mention these foreign free people who will become the soldiers of the kingdom and guard our borders. Are they not treated as well as slaves? If that is the case , not only does it appear that we are too harsh, but it will also make them dissatisfied and affect their enthusiasm for recruitment and future battles. Do you think that's right, Lord Alexis?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alexis has been engaged in military affairs, and he is very concerned about the kingdom's interests. I don't know much about social life. After hearing these words, I couldn't help but feel a little embarrassed, so I had to say frankly: "Thank you Lord Lysias for reminding me. I have indeed ignored this issue. When I return to the Ministry of Military Affairs and discuss it with my colleagues, After discussion, we will decide how much salary these free people soldiers need to be paid." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is not just a question of salary." Another rotating chairman, Sedorum, interjected: "Their military food supply, their weapons and equipment, their The material consumption...I am afraid that these need to be provided by the kingdom. Tens of thousands of people! What they consume is not a small amount, and His Majesty also said just now that this is not a temporary arrangement, this is a long-term decree. It is a new important decision for the kingdom! This means that the strong support of the Etruscan League is only temporary. For our kingdom, this large amount of expenditure will definitely be incurred in the long term, but this large sum of money Where will the expenses come from?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Sedorum finished speaking, several senior ministers and the rotating chairman looked at each other, and they all understood that this was the difficulty in implementing this new resolution.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alexis was stunned, and then replied: "Of course it comes from the treasury."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as he finished speaking, the financial officer Archibedes, who had been impatient for a long time, immediately shouted: "No! This can't do! I just said It has been said that the treasury is tight and there is no extra money to support such a long-term mercenary army!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As an important minister of the kingdom, Alexis was contradicted by Alkibiades, who was only a mid-level official. Even if he had Qian Yan, at this moment, could no longer hold back on his face, and immediately said in a deep voice: "Our army has lost so many soldiers, it has won so many gold and silver mines for the kingdom, acquired so much good land, and added so much wealth to the kingdom. , Now we need the treasury to provide some help to the army. Is this how your Finance Department treats the Military Department?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Alkibiades was glared at by Alexis, and he felt a little guilty, but he kept Melses in mind. The words of advice: "When we guard the treasury for the kingdom, we must be like a mother defending her child. We must never give in easily. Even if we spend an extra Obol, we have to worry about it for a long time. This is a qualified minister of finance." You will gain the respect of His Majesty the King!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
