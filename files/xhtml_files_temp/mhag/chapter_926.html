   Chapter 926 Asistes's Suggestions&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Stolo, my family just baked some bread with newly ground flour, and it's still hot! It's very fragrant! Take a few pieces back to try!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Stolo, have all the houses in the Aventine been demolished? I heard that the city hall will build larger and better-looking houses in the future. Is it true?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Stolo, I saw people from the city hall coming to your house in the afternoon. It might be something happened."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Words of enthusiasm and concern warmed Stolo. When he was confined at home by the Theonians, these neighbors still provided all kinds of help to his family as much as possible. This is why he has been willing to give his family as much help as possible in recent years. Reasons why legal help is provided to them at low prices or even free of charge.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He responded with a smile and quickened his pace home again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Stolo, you are finally back!" As soon as he entered the house, his wife Konya rushed over and hugged him tightly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I'm fine, what happened?" Stolo asked softly, stroking his wife's back.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Someone came from the city hall in the afternoon and emphasized that you must go to the city hall after you go home to meet with the Assi... Chief Executive. Stolo, is this... nothing going to happen? !" Konya looked at him with worry.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "We have experienced the worst things, and we have survived them smoothly. What bad things can happen!" The experience during this period of time made the originally innocent and lovely noble wife almost become a frightened bird. Stolo He pinched her nose with his hand and said calmly: "It's probably the Theonians who saw that I performed well and were ready to give me a more important task."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Really? That's great!" When Konya heard this, she seemed to take it seriously and said hurriedly: "Stolo, when you go to the city hall and see the chief executive later, you must tell him. Can...can you let my mother and sister go home?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stolo was stunned: Since the families of the Romans who had fled to the Capitoline Mountains were forced down the mountain, except for a small number of civilian family members whose identities were verified by the city hall and released home, most of the rest of the aristocratic family members were imprisoned. In the city, some were escorted to Satnicum to persuade the defenders to surrender. Stolo's mother-in-law was the wife of the famous Roman senator Ambustus, and Konya's sister's husband was still leading the army in Satnicum. The recalcitrant Roman general Servius of Qom, so the city hall would not release them easily.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stolo had inquired about this matter a few days ago, but facing his wife's expectant gaze, he still nodded and said, "Okay, I will go and request it from the chief executive."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Konya suddenly smiled like a flower, went to bring the dinner to the table in person, and served Stolo very attentively.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During this time, even at dusk, the City Hall in Rome was still very busy. Allocation and transportation of food and materials to the two armies, land distribution, housing arrangements, etc. for newly moved Theonian citizens, supervision of the autumn harvest and subsequent taxation, and support for the upcoming Hades celebration and The urgent organization and preparation of the rugby match...A series of complicated and urgent administrative matters were placed in front of Asistes and his subordinates, urging them to complete them day and night. So when Stolo walked into the city hall and saw all the officials working hard and walking like flying, he couldn't help but sigh.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Stolo was brought into Asistes' office, Asistes had just sent away the officials of the inspection department. He was also almost 50 years old. After working at the desk for a long time, he could not help but feel aches and pains in his back. He stood up, stretched his waist in the room, and paced back and forth. When he saw Stolo coming in, he motioned for him to sit down, while he continued to stand and speak: "I heard from Maienas that you have done a great job these days, especially It helped the engineering team resolve several major conflicts in a timely manner."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "There was no conflict between them, it was just a communication problem." Stolo said cautiously.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Differences in customs and habits, differences in ideas, coupled with language barriers and the inability to communicate normally, have led to conflicts between old and new citizens... This is already the most troublesome problem in maintaining order in the city of Rome today. This is not It's a trivial matter!" Asistes rubbed his forehead and said solemnly: "Just now the inspector came here to complain to me, saying that there were too few Roman citizens who joined their inspection office and knew Greek, and there were even more literate people. If there are too few, they will always be unable to stop and persuade the two parties to the conflict when performing their tasks, and sometimes it will easily arouse greater conflicts. If this continues, it will not be conducive to the stability of Rome, so I decided to let you go on inspection. at.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As far as I know, you used to be proficient in Roman law and often helped civilians defend themselves, so I want you to go to the patrol office and first follow the patrol team to handle various disputes in the city. At the same time, you will also gradually become familiar with our laws in Theonia. In the future What do you think about taking on the role of inspector? "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stolo did not agree immediately. He thought for a while, showed hesitation, and said tentatively: "I heard that Theonia also has the position of tribune, who can help people fight for their rights and safeguard their interests. I I want to... take up this position in the future."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Tribune?!" The city of Yasisk was slightly surprised. He advised: "You may not have understood that the tribunes of Theonia are very different from the former Roman tribunes. As far as I know, I know that the Roman tribunes are a major way for civilians to enter the upper echelons of the city-state, and they can even participate in the Senate. The Theonian tribunes seem to have more power and can accuse officials at all levels, including chief executives like me. There are even senators who can meet with the king and point out the shortcomings of a certain law... However, once you become a tribune of Theonia, it means that you will no longer be able to inherit other administrative positions and have nothing to do with the kingdom's politics. Insulation, this is to ensure the independence of the tribunes and not be affected by administrative officials, so the tribunes of Theonia are basically composed of Theonia who have no intention of developing in the political arena and want to do something for the people. Most of them are middle-aged and elderly citizens, and few young citizens who want to make a difference want to become tribunes."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stolo really didn't know much about the details of the tribunes of Theonia, so he was a little stunned when he heard this.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Asistes looked at him and understood some of his psychology, so he continued: "In fact, you can rest assured that the Kingdom of Theonia treats all races in the country equally and will not deliberately be biased. Of course, if you I really want to do something for the Romans, serve as an inspector or become a judge, make outstanding political achievements, and become a senator of the kingdom in the future, so that I can truly safeguard some of the rights of Roman citizens in Theonia in the Senate!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As far as I know, you and Sextus are good friends. He has now achieved many military exploits and has already served as captain. It is very likely that within a few years, he will serve as captain of the Roman legion, even before he is 40 years old. Are you willing to become a Theonian elder? "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stolo was shocked.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing the sudden change in his expression, Asistes knew that his words had an effect. He walked back to the desk and sat down again: "This matter is related to your future development in the kingdom. You go back and think about it carefully, and give it to me within two days." Just reply. I'm here to see you this time, and there's something more important that you need to do."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this point, Asistes looked directly at Stolo and said in a deep voice: "I just received the battle report from your majesty. The Satnicum garrison has surrendered!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stolo was taken aback and asked involuntarily: "The Satnicum garrison surrendered?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Not only did Satnicum surrender, but just one day later, Vilitre also surrendered."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Asistes' words gave Stolo another heavy blow, leaving him stunned on the spot: although he did not agree to go to Satnicum to persuade him to surrender, he knew very well that his father also had a crush on Camillus. I knew something about it and thought that even if they were at a disadvantage, they would resist to the end. Unexpectedly, they actually surrendered! As soon as Satnicum fell, the resistance of the Romans disappeared, and there was no possibility of recovery for Rome!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing Stolo sitting on a wooden chair with an uncertain expression on his face, Asistes coughed lightly: "Although the last time you went to the Capitoline Mountains to persuade you to surrender, you were rejected. But I hope If you go up there again, I think the surrender of the Camillus army will have a certain impact on them on the mountain."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a long while, Stolo replied feebly: "...I'll try my best to give it a try, but I have a few questions to ask."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "you say."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stolo asked eagerly: "My father...is he okay now?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Asistes pondered for a while and said solemnly: "I don't want to deceive you, but you must swear to the gods not to leak what I said before I tell you."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stolo looked at Asistes in surprise, and then swore an oath to Jupiter.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Actually, a plague broke out in Satnicum, and the Roman generals had to..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Before Asistes finished speaking, Stolo screamed: "What?! Plague! -" He immediately covered his mouth with his hand, but the hand trembled involuntarily.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Asistes immediately comforted him and said: "The plague is the most terrible disease in the eyes of you Romans, but our Theonian medicine is advanced and we have considerable research on the treatment of plague. Your Majesty is convening doctors to treat the disease." Soldiers are being treated, and I believe that many people will be able to recover in half a month."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Stolo calmed down a bit, and then asked eagerly: "Then has my father...has-"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Asistes said calmly: "Your father has been infected and is being treated in a camp near the city of Satnicum. I suggest you not to visit him now to avoid contracting the plague. In addition, Satni Camillus had already died of the disease before the garrison of Qom surrendered...Oh, and your brother-in-law, Servius, was also infected."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
