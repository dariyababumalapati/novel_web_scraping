   Chapter 1088 Rotating Chairman Sipulos&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   was at the residence of another rotating chairman. When Sipulos saw that it was Siktas who came to visit, he was a little surprised and asked with a smile: "Why, you are also here to select the regional administrator." Sir?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sictas shrugged helplessly: "Your Majesty, your Majesty, since your Majesty announced this in the afternoon, the Senate has been like boiling water, and the debate has not stopped when the meeting ended. I came here just now At that time, I saw several streets full of horse-drawn carriages... Everyone is asking for help in selecting the district chief executive. How could I stand by and watch." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But you are not even the town chief executive yet. "It's too early for you to be the regional administrator." The reason why Sipulos said so directly was because after Syracuse was conquered, as the wartime governor of Sicily, he was able to serve in a relatively short period of time. Sictas contributed a lot to stabilizing the order of this once largest city-state in Sicily within a short period of time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Later, when the chief executive of Syracuse had not yet been determined and he was temporarily governing, he also received great assistance from Sictas, so the two parties established a good working relationship.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Later, Siktas was transferred to Turiyi and was taken care of by Sipulos many times. The two became good friends over time.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Of course not for me, but for Syracuse." Sictas said seriously: "You also know that since Lord Adriancus became the administrator of Syracuse, he will Lacuza governs very well. My relatives and friends in Syracuse have praised him many times in letters. I am thinking that the development of Syracuse is just on the right track now. Instead of electing a Syracuse people It is better for a senator who is unfamiliar with and does not understand the situation in Syracuse to serve as the chief executive of the region. It is better to elect Lord Adrianx. He should make the development of this region better, so he came to visit you specially. I want to gain your support."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Xiktas, I have told you several times, you are now the patriarch of the Kingdom of Theonia, don't just focus on Syracuse, just for the benefit of Syracuse When speaking, you should take a broader view and pay attention to other towns, so that you can gain the recognition of His Majesty and other senators!" Siprnos reminded with a serious expression.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I listened to your words, and I have been slowly changing. This is not the case a few days ago about whether to accept the request of the Frentani people, form an alliance with them, send the navy to help them patrol the coast, and drive away pirates. 'I also have a say in the proposal... But Syracuse is my foundation. If I don't speak for its interests, the people in my hometown will scold me!" Sictas said sincerely.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sipulos stopped and saw that he understood, so he directly answered the election question he mentioned: "You don't need to worry about whether Adriankos can become the chief executive of Syracuse. He is the founder of the Syracuse Region. One of the founders of Theonia is older than me and has deeper connections than me. Not to mention other things, the veterans in the military will definitely support him. The key question now is whether he is willing to become a Chief of Lacuza District, instead of convincing me, you might as well convince him."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing that Sictas wanted to speak, Sipulos waved his hand and said, "Don't worry, after the meeting, His Majesty met with the five of us again. The rotating chairman discussed and, for the sake of fairness, decided to postpone the final selection time to 10 days, so that the elders who serve as chief executives in various towns can come back in time to attend this important meeting." "Then I&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   can rest assured .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It's done." Xiktas breathed a sigh of relief.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It is better to care about yourself than to care about others. After the addition of regional administrators this time, the position of the Kingdom's town administrator will be open to the kingdom's mid-level officials. By then, the competition for the position of town administrator will become very fierce. You are now Or the town administrative deputy?" Sipulos asked with concern.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Administrative adjutant of Amendolara." When mentioning his position, Xiktas complained: "Amendolara, despite its small town area, has quite a lot going on, and the most important thing is... ... Most of the citizens there rush directly into the city hall at every turn to report problems to us. The pavement slabs in front of their houses are cracked... The ditches in their fields are caved in... Wait, it's all... For trivial matters, you can't punish them for their rudeness, but you also have to try to help them solve the problem, because they all have that small disc on their Bolton-" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Theonia Jian Medal of Allies." Sipulos nodded and expressed understanding: "The status of the old citizens of Amendolara in the kingdom is quite special. Even when I arrived in Amendolara, the situation was not much better than yours. But after this After three years of special training in Amendolara, I believe you are not only familiar with the laws of the kingdom, but also able to skillfully handle various government affairs in the town. After the election of the regional chief executive this time, there will be many positions of town chief executive. If there is a vacancy, you must seize this opportunity and seek a position as a town administrator as soon as possible. This will be conducive to your future development in the kingdom's political arena!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sipulos' heartfelt words moved Siktas personally, and he said sincerely : "Thank you for your reminder! I will definitely work hard to get promoted, and I hope you can give me more support!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sipulos did not hesitate and immediately agreed: "Of course I will speak for you, but in the end, the town The appointment of the chief executive must be decided by your majesty, but you have performed well in Amendolara. I believe that it will not be a problem to take up the post of town chief executive." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   That would be great!" Xiktas looked excited.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Well, how is your nephew Samoratis doing now?" Sipulos asked.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "He is still the same as before. He has no interest in becoming a government official in the kingdom. He only wants to become an army officer. Now he is working as a firefighter in Amendolara and focuses his main energy on military training." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Everyone. His ambitions are different. He can become a legionnaire. If he can be promoted to legion commander in the future, he will also have the opportunity to enter the Senate. This is also a good path..." Sipulos said with a smile.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "But once the war breaks out, who knows what will happen... Sigh..." Xiktas sighed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay, it's getting late. You should go back quickly. Staying here for too long will have a bad impact on you and me." At this time, Sipulos said softly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Xiktas stood up without hesitation, bowed respectfully to Sipulos, turned around and left the mansion.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On this night, not only did the kingdom's high-level officials come and go frequently in the city of Thurii, but most ordinary people also gathered in restaurants and pubs, discussing intensely today at the Senate House. These resolutions were promulgated.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After this night, as the news gradually spread throughout the country, this phenomenon also appeared in various towns.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The inspector was worried about this and asked Davos for instructions: "Your Majesty, do you want to temporarily issue a curfew? To prevent accidents!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After thinking about it, Davos did not agree. He only said slowly: "No, you have to trust the citizens of the kingdom."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Despite Davos's statement, the patrol department did not dare to take it lightly and urgently notified the patrol offices of various towns at night. Send additional patrols.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, as a few days passed, except for the increase in people drinking and making trouble at night, the increase in fights among laborers at the port, and the protests by local council members in various towns and cities against these resolutions, the entire kingdom was basically relatively stable.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As King Davos said, "Believe in the citizens of Theonia!", whether it is based on patriotism, sense of responsibility, or fear of being sent to the border to guard, or because this 6% tax is very important to wealth. It is indeed not worth mentioning to them... Moreover, Davos asked the intelligence agencies to conduct planned and step-by-step publicity across the country in advance, so that citizens unknowingly reduced their aversion to the tax increase. On the contrary, we feel lucky that the taxes are not too high.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In short, the citizens of the kingdom accepted the new taxation bill relatively calmly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Citizens did not protest, and those registered freedmen and preparatory citizens did not dare to come out to make trouble at this time. Otherwise, once they have a criminal record, it will be very difficult to become a formal citizen according to the new immigration bill.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The real dissatisfiers are those free citizens who want to join the Kingdom of Theonia but have not yet registered. However, they are not scattered enough to cause much trouble to the kingdom, and the new immigration bill has not completely cut off them. They have become Daionia. The path for Onian citizens is only more difficult. Once they gradually regain their senses from disappointment, anger, alcoholism, and noise, and accept the reality, they have to make a choice: to join the newly formed border army and fight for an early Become a citizen of Theonia?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Or should he safely continue to live in the kingdom and obtain citizenship while waiting for a longer time?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Or because he is too old and does not meet the recruitment requirements, but he can still take the risk and settle in southern Iberia?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166; &#13;
      The quiet domestic situation also made Davos&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ,&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   who had always seemed calm and composed, secretly relieved, allowing him to receive his friends in a more relaxed mood... &#226;&#128;&#148;Plato, the great scholar from Athens.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos held a banquet in the palace to entertain Plato and his favorite disciple Spesippus, and invited the foreign minister and historian Ansitanus, the dean of the School of Literature of the Theonian Academy and Plato's former student. Lysias, an old acquaintance of Athens, accompanied him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Not only did I feel very sorry that I didn't hear your special speech at the conference this time, but it also made our entire conference eclipse a lot!" Davos said to Plato with a look of regret.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
