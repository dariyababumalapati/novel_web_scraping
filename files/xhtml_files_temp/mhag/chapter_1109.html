   Chapter 1109: Revenge&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Originally Okriton was prepared to be teased, but he didn't expect that Haka would explain in words, which gave him a little confidence in today's talks, so he smiled and said: "Even if it's The Carthaginians almost all admit that Theonia's medical skills are the highest in the entire Western Mediterranean, so the advice they gave you is of course correct. You look very healthy now!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Theonia Biga There are many good things about Carthage, not just medical skills." Haka's tone was still calm: "But for you, it is best to hope that I live a few more years, because this will be good for Carthage."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka's words This cheered up Okriton, who seemed to sense that Haka was showing goodwill to Carthage.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Please sit down, Lord Okriton." Haka pointed to the opposite side of the heated pool and said: "There is another reason why I invite you to meet in the bathroom. The Turiyi people think that the bath is the best time to talk, because both parties are Be honest, there is nothing to hide."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Okriton nodded, without any further hesitation, stepped directly into the pool and sat on the stone bench in the pool.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Would you like a glass of wine? This is the best wine produced by the Tulii Orifes family. Its output is not large and you can't usually buy it in the market. These few bottles of wine I have are all given by His Majesty, saying that they are for taking a bath. Drinking a little when you are young is good for your health..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Okriton wanted to refuse, but changed his mind after hearing the next words: "Then have a drink."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The slave standing by the pool poured a glass of wine.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Okriton took it, he took a sip and felt the sweet and sour taste. He couldn't help but exclaimed: "How comfortable it is to be able to soak in comfortable water and drink such good wine every day! Haha! Mr. Ka, I really envy you!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka said calmly: "Carthaginians can fully enjoy this kind of life, but you are still attached to the past and cannot accept the reality."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka said this The words were a bit vague, and Okriton couldn't accurately grasp its meaning for a while, so he asked tentatively: "You mean..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka did not respond directly, but asked instead: "I have known Carthaginian for more than 10 years. The nobles have also developed the habit of taking baths, but what do you think is the difference between Theonia and Carthage in taking baths?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although he didn't know why Haka asked this, Okriton still thought about it seriously. , and then replied: "We Carthaginians take a bath and remove these tedious links. We just soak in the hot water pool, then massage and shave..." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Actually, those links that were removed by the Carthaginians It was precisely the purpose of the Theonian people who invented bathing. They believed that bathing was a useful exercise for physical exercise, while the Carthaginians only regarded it as a kind of enjoyment." Haka did not wait for Okriton to make a decision. In response, he picked up another handful of water with his hands and asked, "Do you know where this water comes from?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Of course it was brought by slaves." If he were in Carthage, Okriton would definitely He said that, but here he felt it was not that simple, so he simply answered: "I don't know much."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It flowed to the house on its own."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka's answer surprised Okriton: "Turiyi Municipal Government The office specially built a pool in your house?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   According to what Okriton learned, the Theonians specially built elevated water bridges to introduce water from the river into the city, covering a wide area in the city. Build pools in important places, and then build sealed waterways to introduce them to supply the people in the city who rely on these pools and water.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "It's not a pool, but a hollow pipe as thick as a spear shaft that was built by the Theonia Construction Department and iron merchants using copper as the main raw material. It was directly connected to the water tower, and then buried under the ground, extending to My kitchen... His Majesty Davos named it the water pipe. The slaves don't have to go to the nearby pool to get water. They only need to turn on the switch of the water pipe, and the water will flow out naturally..." Haka introduced it quite proudly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Okriton looked amazed, but he also realized: "This kind of water pipeline uses copper as the main raw material, and the copper material and cost should not be a small amount, right?" "It does&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   cost a lot, but the cost They are all paid by the residents who apply for the installation of water pipes, and the water fees are paid monthly (water in public pools is free), because the water management office has also designed a device that can calculate the water consumption of residents... even if the fee is not Low, there are still many citizens who have heard the news and asked to apply for the installation of water pipes. However, it has just started operation, and the consumption of copper materials is too high, so it is only installed in the inner city for the time being.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Someone once suggested, "It will be cheaper to replace it." , and more abundant lead is used to make water pipes.' You also know that there are many lead mines in Corsica and southern Iberia that Theonia just acquired, but His Majesty severely criticized this proposal, saying It's 'lead is very harmful to the human body after it dissolves in water.' Now iron merchants are working hard to research cheaper and more durable materials for making water pipes, such as using tin as the main raw material... Because once developed successfully, just relying on the patent You can make a lot of profits with the fees you get, and maybe in a few years, you can see water pipes in the homes of wealthy citizens in other towns in the Kingdom of Theonia..." After&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka finished speaking, he saw Okriton at the door. Listening intently, his expression gradually became serious, and he said in a deep voice: "Because of Carthage's past glory in the Western Mediterranean, the Carthaginians have always proudly believed that their mother state is the best country in the Western Mediterranean and owns the best country in the Western Mediterranean. The best culture, and even other races, are barbarians in the eyes of the Carthaginians.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I also had this pride when I was in Iberia, but when I came to Thurii and stayed here for more than a year, I felt that The pride has gone. Although Theonia is a new kingdom, it is much better than Carthage!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I believe that when you enter the mouth of the Craty River, what you see will make you think like this, Just the city of Thurii is already much more powerful than Carthage, not to mention the Kingdom of Theonia, Crotone, Catanai, Rome, Syracuse... These strengths are also not inferior to The big cities of Carthage, they are not Utica.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Utica is an important ally of Carthage, at critical moments it may not obey the orders of the Carthage Senate because of its own interests, but Theonia All towns in the kingdom are under the direct jurisdiction of His Majesty the King and the Senate. When a war occurs, they can concentrate all their manpower and financial resources and do their best to fight the enemy. This is why Theonia was able to defeat the Carcass in the Western Mediterranean War. The main reason for Taiji.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the failure of that war, Theonia's national power increased day by day, but Carthage was weakened to the point that it may not even be as good as Catanai. In such a situation of extremely disparity in strength, you are still Still resisting..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "We have no intention of confronting Theonia!" Okriton was shocked and quickly defended: "We just want to live our own lives! But now those humble Eastern Numibians People are frequently harassing our territory. If it were not for the peace agreement signed between Carthage and Theonia, and the East Numibians are Theonia's allies, we would have gathered a large army to attack these hateful people. The Numibian tribe!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka showed a sneer: "Didn't you fight back? No, you have already fought with the Numibians, but you suffered a defeat." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   That was just a... It was a small battle. We originally wanted to teach the Numibians a lesson and let them retreat in spite of difficulties, but we didn't expect that they would send so many warriors..." Okriton defended himself forcefully.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "In that case..." Haka opened his arms, held the edge of the pool, and said calmly: "I can suggest to your majesty that you choose to ignore it when you launch an attack on the Numibians."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Okriton He didn't expect Haka to give this answer, and was speechless for a moment.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka took advantage of the situation and said unceremoniously: "Look, I just said that the Carthaginians today are unwilling to accept reality. You are an obvious example! With Carthage's current strength, it can defeat Eastern Numbia. People? You know, the Numibians have now got rid of their fear of the Carthaginians. Although they still go their own way, they can still reach an agreement on the matter of 'fighting the Carthaginians'. In addition, They can now obtain more sophisticated weapons and armor from Theonia... Carthage gathers the power of its Phoenician allies and fights with all its strength. It may be able to win, but I believe the casualties will be high. The key question is whether Carthage can still Can you give orders to the Phoenician city-states on the continent of Africa as before?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Okriton wanted to say "Yes!", but when he saw Haka's half-smiling face, he swallowed back his words with a slight smile on his face. Showing embarrassment: "Yes... those Phoenician allies are no longer as closely united around Carthage as before the war. As time goes by, anyone with a discerning eye can see... We Carthage is weakening day by day. The Kingdom of Theonia, with its vast territory and huge population, has become a powerful presence that cannot be bypassed by any race or city-state living in the Western Mediterranean.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Especially the Phoenician city-states east of the Robben Peninsula, they have very few Following the orders of Carthage, they frequently sent envoys to Hadrumentum, which was said to allow their merchants to more easily enter the vast market of the Kingdom of Theonia. Hatrumentum was like a root The poisonous needle has been stuck in the body of the Carthage Alliance, and it has begun to exert its destructive power..." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   To tell you the truth." Haka splashed the pool water on his chest, rubbed it gently, and then slowly Immersing the body in the pool: "It was I who suggested to His Majesty Davos, 'Drive the Eastern Numibians to invade the few lands you have left in the interior...'"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
