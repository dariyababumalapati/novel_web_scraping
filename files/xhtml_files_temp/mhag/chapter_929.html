   Chapter 929 Leotychides' Persistence&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sipulos looked at Leotychides' expressionless face and suspected that the last sentence he asked was intentional, because his main purpose of coming here was to fight against the demands of the people of Catanai to repel the Katanai people. Regarding the rampaging Carthaginian cavalry on the Catania Plain, he coughed dryly and quickly thought of a new topic: "I haven't received any new battle reports for several days. What is going on in the south of the Catania Plain now?" A situation?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as the military was mentioned, Leotychides became interested. Of course, the prerequisite was that Sipulos, as the wartime governor, was qualified to understand the entire war situation, and Leotychides also needed to explain himself to him. The next strategy was to gain his support, so he reached out to the side and asked Sipulos to sit down.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then, Leotychides pointed at the map and said to him: "In the past two days, the scout cavalry we sent out either disappeared or escaped injured. We did not get any new information at all. The Carthaginian cavalry Not only are they wreaking havoc on the Catania Plain, they are also blocking our connection with the south of the Catania Plain. We don't know what the current situation of the Seventh Army is, and we don't know what the situation is like in Paragonia. I don't know what the situation of Leotini is. The only thing I know is that Taunis was surrounded by the Syracuse people, but the Syracuse army did not attack with all its strength... This is the clipper ship of the Sicilian fleet every day. I believe you also know all the reports that must be made during the day, except for this..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leotychides used his hand to point on the wooden map to Paragonia, Gena, Leotini, and the new military camp of Catanai not far to the north, and then to the west of the city of Catanai. Drawing a large circle with the south, which covers almost half of the Catania plain, he said in a solemn tone: "This large area has been completely obscured by the Carthaginian cavalry. We now do not understand the seventh place in the south. We don't know the situation of the legions and allies, nor do we know the location and movements of the enemy army, so under such circumstances, if we send troops out of the city to attack the Carthaginian cavalry, they may directly run into the Carthaginian army not long after leaving the city."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At the end, Leotychides returned to the previous issue. Sipulos didn't pay attention. Leotychides' words had already made him feel the seriousness of the entire battle situation. He asked with some worry. : "So according to your judgment, what might the Carthaginian army be doing now?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leotychides stared at the map, somewhat remorseful, but also said with confidence: "Although I...ignored before that the huge Carthaginian cavalry would cover the entire battlefield, making it difficult for us to easily move anywhere. Gaining contact made it impossible to implement some of the previously made plans, but I can still guess the movements of the Carthaginians. They are either attacking Paragonia or Leotini, because they only have these two. choose.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   By capturing Paragonia, the Carthaginians could not only open up a flat road from Camanlina to the Catania plain, which would facilitate the transportation of their military supplies and baggage, but they could also provide close support to the other forces surrounding Gena. A Carthaginian army. After all, Gena and Paragonia are not too far apart. As long as Gena is captured, the entire southwest area of &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;the Catania plain will be completely under the control of the Carthaginians. Their army can confidently and boldly reach our city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And if the Carthaginians attack Leotini, as long as they capture it, the Carthaginian army will either continue to go north, bypass Lake Leotini, and attack our newly built military camp; or they can lead their army eastward and fight with Syracuse. The Zha people will join forces and attack Taunis with all their strength. Once Taunis falls, their coalition forces will approach Catanai. "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After listening to Leotychides' words, Sipulus looked solemn and lost in thought, then asked uncertainly: "From what you said, the Carthaginians are most likely to choose to attack Paragonia. ?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He is worthy of being the most capable administrator in Sicily. Even if he is not commanding a battle, he can still find the correct answer through his excellent political sense... Leotychides nodded approvingly in his heart and said: "I think although the Carthaginians The people of Syracuse have now united to fight against our Theonia, but after all, they have been fighting each other for decades, and their relationship cannot be very close. If Carthage chooses to attack Leotini and Taunis, this route , then its military food transportation will mostly rely on the Syracuse people. I think it is impossible for the commander of any army to completely trust the food transportation line that is related to the life and death of the army to an ally who was a mortal enemy a few years ago.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After capturing Paragonia, the Carthaginians' rear was completely controlled by their own people. Not only could they attack our Catanai with confidence, but they could also attack Hena, Agilion, and Hebita, and the entire West They have occupied the Kyle Mountains. By then, they will not only threaten Catanai, but also Naxos and Sikuli. The Carthaginians will have more choices. "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Siplos became even more worried. He asked urgently: "Can Paragonia be defended?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leotychides hesitated for a moment, and then said with certainty: "Lord Sipulos, you should know that a few months ago, before the Carthaginians actually participated in the war, we had already conquered Paragonia. As a fortress to defend against the Carthaginian attack, it has been continuously reinforcing its city defenses and building a large number of defense facilities. Therefore, Paragonia blocked the Carthaginian attack for several days before, and the Carthaginian even None of them broke through the outer perimeter of Paragonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Originally, there were 2,000 legion reserve soldiers in the town of Paragonia. A few days ago, the Seventh Legion sent an additional 2,000 soldiers there. For a small defensive fortress, these troops are enough. Even if the Carthaginians attack from the north, even if they send all their troops, they will never be able to capture it in a short time. What we need most now is to delay time. "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sipros understood that Leoticides was referring to the coming reinforcements from the kingdom, but he still seemed a little worried: "I don't know much about military affairs, and I don't know much about the changes in the current war situation, but if I am just passive, Being beaten and hoping that the Carthaginians will do exactly what we want, I'm worried that something unexpected will happen!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leotychides raised his head, looked at Sipros, and said with emphasis: "Does Sir Sipros really think that I just sit at home and do nothing these days?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Siplos heard the dissatisfaction in Leotychides' words, but his expression remained unchanged and he did not respond.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leotychides looked at him coldly for a while, and then continued: "This time, the number of the Carthaginian army greatly exceeds ours, and their combat effectiveness is not weak, and their arms are also very complete. We really cannot engage in a head-on confrontation with them. Confrontation, but this does not mean that the Carthaginian army has no shortcomings. Their biggest shortcoming is the transportation of military supplies!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even though the autumn harvest has just ended, the Carthaginians have obtained food from the city-states on the south coast, and may also have Syracuse to provide assistance, but for such an army with as many as 100,000 soldiers, it is still far away. Far from enough. According to my inference, the food supply in Sicily can only sustain the Carthaginian army for a month or two. They need the Carthage base to transport more food to them, but you see-"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leotychides pointed his finger at the icon of the basic city of Carthage on the map, and then rowed across the western sea, to western Sicily, and then along the southern coastline to Paragonia. His tone was still cold, but his eyes were clear. The light was much brighter: "With such a long grain transportation line, it is difficult for the Carthaginians to ensure its safety. After the Carthaginian army was frustrated in attacking Paragonia from the south, I concluded that they wanted to cross the mountains, so I specially contacted He captured the West Kells and asked them to organize soldiers and sneak into the mountains on the southern edge of the Catania Plain, waiting for an opportunity to sneak attack the Carthaginian grain transport team. But unfortunately... there are a lot of Ibis in the Carthaginian army. The natives of Leah, they are very good at fighting in the mountains, so that the Sikel people have not achieved any results so far, but as long as the Sikel warriors have been active in that area, the Carthaginians will never dare to relax their vigilance, which will involve They have a lot of energy.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Moreover, Seclian led the Sicilian fleet to patrol the south coast at all times. As long as he found the Carthaginian grain transport convoy, he could land at any time and send fleet infantry to attack. I have also discussed with Seclian that as long as he feels it is feasible, I can allocate thousands of soldiers to his command at any time to take the Sicilian fleet to recapture any city-state on the south coast, and even capture the Phoenician towns in western Sicily... ...The larger the Carthaginian army becomes, the faster its army will collapse once its food transportation lines are cut off. "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Having said this, Leotychides' eyes were as bright as lightning, he looked directly at Sipulos, and said firmly: "So we don't have to be afraid of the Carthaginians' aggressive attack. The villages have been burned down, but they can be rebuilt, and the farmland has been destroyed." Destroyed, the ground is still there. As long as we hold on to Catanai and wait for the opportunity, the Carthaginian army will expose their Achilles heel. By then-" Leotyzides' right hand exerted force slashed downwards.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After a moment, Sipulos smiled: "I feel relieved after hearing what you said, Mr. Proseus. Don't worry too, I will find a way to appease the people."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Sipulos left, Leotychides was still looking at the map. His eyes were focused on the icon of Paragonia. He had a worry in his heart that he had not expressed just now: Can Paragonia hold on? how long? !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, the adjutant Tagru came in and said: "My lord, Acethemis wants to see you."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leotychides's face darkened: "I have told him several times that now is not the time for cavalry to attack. Why can't he listen?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
