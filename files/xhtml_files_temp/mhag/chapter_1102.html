   Chapter 1102: Selection of Regional Chief Executive (6)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Amintas's reason is simple and crude &#226;&#128;&#147; compared with qualifications.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The reason why Davos was surprised was that if this was a joint decision of the military senators, then someone would definitely tell him in advance. If not, then this may be Amyntas's private decision: Isn't it true that the senators have not been treated in the past? Amyntas, who was interested in the Senate, after launching active service in the army, was still thinking about it and wanted to develop in the Senate?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, Agarcia and Amyntas were good friends during the expedition to Persia, and they have been in close contact over the years. It is understandable that Amyntas wants to help his friend.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, there are many mercenaries who have turned to the political arena, such as Hilos, Capos, Sesta, Adriankos... Agarcia is a relatively inconspicuous one among them. He has held many positions over the years. The chief executive of the sub-town has always been quite satisfactory and has no very impressive political achievements. Therefore, Davos does not think that he can manage this area that has been most ravaged by war and lead the people of the south coast of Sicily and West Kel. People can get out of the predicament after the war as soon as possible...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, nothing can be absolute, and after all, Agacia is an old subordinate of Davos and has always completed the tasks assigned to him diligently, so he does not intend to stop it: However, Amyntas thought that if he raised his voice, the senators from the military faction and other senators who were friends with him would all support him, but he was totally wrong.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Kingdom of Theonia has been established for almost 20 years. There are nearly a hundred senators who have successively become veterans from the army. Each has its own interests and demands. It is no longer the time for the original mercenary senators to respond to everything. Even those with the smallest number of senators The navy cannot be completely united, and sometimes it is divided into two factions, Cykerian and Midorades, not to mention the huge army.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Rising stars with outstanding military exploits like Proseus and Printoles would not mix with the mercenary elders at all; and new elders like Patroclus and Sextus would not treat the elders Do as you say; generals like Lizaru and Urazar who come from other regions also have their own racial demands; even the mercenary veterans themselves are not monolithic, with differences between the military headquarters and the generals of each legion, differences in personality and work style (such as Alexis and Amyntas)... This is exactly what Davos hopes, because only he can unite the military senators. If they themselves can be twisted into a rope, then they should wear Firth was worried.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then Saru was the second to stand up, and he still recommended Hegesitus.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos still recognizes Hegesitus' ability, but if Saru recommends him at this time, is he confident that he can defeat the military veterans?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Or maybe Sedorum, who was behind him, saw that Amyntas was pretending to be a bully, and believed that the southern coast of Sicily was small in land and sparsely populated, and involved complex issues such as post-war reconstruction and the integration of the Sikel people in the mountains. , so it is not attractive to some veterans, and the competition will not be too fierce?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos glanced at Cedorum in the front row of the venue: This old guy is quite shrewd and knows how to find weak points, but can he really do what he wants?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos leaned back on his seat and watched the development of things with interest.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sure enough, there were very few recommenders, but just as the etiquette officer was about to announce the start of voting, a shout came from behind him: "Wait a minute, I also have someone to recommend!" There was an&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   uproar in the venue.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Antaoris stood up and said confidently: "The law does not stipulate that the rotating chairman responsible for presiding over the meeting has no right to make selections."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Oh, now it's interesting!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ... Davos stroked his chin with his hand, guessing in his mind the candidate he wanted to recommend, and prepared to watch the show.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Antaoris cleared his throat, straightened his chest, and said loudly: "The person I want to recommend is Keleru!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Keleru, who was sitting in the venue, was stunned when he heard this, because he had not mentioned it beforehand. After talking to Antaoris, I didn't expect that the rotating chairman would actually recommend me.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Originally, he really coveted the position of chief executive of the south coast of Sicily, and even prepared to nominate himself. However, after seeing that both Amyntas and Salu recommended candidates, he thought that he had little chance of winning, so he chose to give up. Unexpectedly, something happened. Another twist.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The first time Mr. Crelu served as the town administrator was in Cnapetia, and he has been in the mountains of Sicily since then. In the four years of Hena and Enna, he has always had outstanding political achievements and won the favor of the people of Sikel. Trust. We all know that most of the territories on the south coast of Sicily are in mountainous areas, and the majority of the population is the West Kells. If the problem of the West Kells is solved, the problems in southern Sicily will be solved, and Crelu is The best candidate."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos nodded secretly, thinking that Antaoris was right. To be honest, he really forgot about the candidate Kereru.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Cedorum was a little restless: first it was Brelu, and now it was Crelu. One Bithynian after another embarrassed himself and made other senators laugh at him, even though Bithynia had already belonged to Turi. Yes, but they are still Brutians.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Especially Kereru, who used to be close to Baguilippi and rarely interact with him, but now, he is the leader of the Bruti people and the rotating chairman of the Senate. If he wants to participate in the election, why not talk to him? Just say it, let this guy intervene!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sedorum looked at Antaoris standing behind the rostrum, and felt depressed: Antaolis is a man who does things based on his preference. He can kill someone in front of many elders in the venue. He was ashamed to refute it, and he could have felt that this person was suitable and fully recommended him when selecting the town chief executive. Although he did not have any factions, he had been recognized by many elders over the years as the rotating chairman. With him as a recommendation, He Gesitus was not guaranteed to win.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just when Sedorum was depressed, the debate in the venue had already begun: "Kereru first stayed in Hena for 4 years, then in Enna for four years, and has stayed in the same area for 8 years. It has expired and you should not come back to compete for the chief executive of the southern Sicily region." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   You have to understand that in the last regional administrative plan made by His Majesty, Gena was included in the Catania region, so it is not allowed at all. There is the problem you mentioned!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "There are both mountainous areas and many seaside towns in the southern region of Sicily, and Mr. Crelu's previous experience is all in mountainous areas. He obviously lacks experience in how to manage seaside towns..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   " As the patriarch of the kingdom, you don't even understand the geography of the country. I'm really ashamed of you! Isn't Knapetia a seaside town? It was during the reign of Kereru that the port of Knapetia was With the expansion, maritime trade has also developed... From this, it can be seen that he is still experienced in managing seaside towns..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Antaolis refuted the elders who made suggestions one by one and was speechless. Provided support for Kereru's final election.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, it is also related to Brelu's good performance in the Western Mediterranean War. Not only did he cooperate with generals such as Alexis, Lizaru, Epithenis, etc., but he also actively cooperated with Sipulos and Sipulos after the war. Myron and Adriancus rectified and governed the Sikel people. These elders not only voted for him, but also led others to support him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the results of the vote were announced, Kereru was surprised and happy, and his whole expression looked a little funny. However, such a result was actually mainly due to his own efforts.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Amyntas was a little annoyed, but Agarcia felt a little indifferent. He was once a penniless mercenary, and now he is a distinguished patriarch of the kingdom. He governs towns with thousands or tens of thousands of people, and has more power than the chief general of a city-state. Big, he is already very satisfied.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, this is also related to his age, decreased energy, and increasing desire for enjoyment.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hegesitus was frustrated at being defeated again, but the selection continued: "The next region to be elected is the Dauni region!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Finally it was Magna Graecia's turn!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The senators sat up straight again.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plagulos, the commander of the Fourth Cavalry Regiment who stood up first: "I recommend Torex..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plagulos is a Messapian. He does not recommend Apirosia, the leader of his race, but recommends him. The leader of Pucetti, but this is not surprising, because everyone knows that he is at odds with Apirosia. The reason is simple: when the Theonian army attacked Messapian territory in a large scale, as Udi Apirosia, the leader of the Aida tribe, was the first to lead his tribe to surrender early. This led many Mesapian tribes to learn from him, and the conquest of the entire Messapi became much easier. At that time, they were still in the dark. The recalcitrant Pregulus hated Apirocia. Even after more than ten years, and the two parties were already colleagues in the kingdom, this resentment still had not completely disappeared, so Pregulus was unwilling to marry Apirosia. The leader of the Messapi senators was more willing to interact with the Pucheti people who had fought together and were of the same race.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course, most of the senators did not care about the grudge between Pleculus and Apirosia. They cared about the recommended Torex. He served as the town administrator for several terms. His performance was quite satisfactory and did not make people feel uncomfortable. Amazing political achievements, but he has a good son-in-law, Marcellis Adoris, whose former name was Davos Adoris, the adopted son of King Davos. It is said that His Majesty the King cares very much about this adopted son. He was about to be promoted to captain of the legion at a young age. In the past, the elders took into account Tonix's special status and tried to provide him with convenience without conflict of interest. At this time, they all subconsciously set their sights on Tonix. King Davos in the center of the venue.&#13;
