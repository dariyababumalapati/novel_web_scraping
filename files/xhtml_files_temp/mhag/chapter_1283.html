   Chapter 1283 Davos goes to Egypt.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos stayed here for two days and met with members of the Messenian Council and a few Messenian citizens, which caused a sensation among the people of the entire territory.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   High-level officials from neighboring city-states such as Sparta, Arcadia, Ellis, Argos, and Corinth also came to pay homage, causing Davos to stay for two more days.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Five days later, Davos said goodbye to the Peloponnesian people, and the fleet sailed southeast, passing through Crete. After replenishing enough water, it sailed straight south.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The next 500-mile long sea voyage is slightly risky, but over the years, under the leadership of the Holy Kingdom of Theonia, it has become the most prosperous route between the Western Mediterranean, mainland Greece, Cyrenaica, and Egypt. One of the routes (the other route is through Sicily to Carthage, and then along the African coast to Egypt. Due to a storm in the African waters last year, which destroyed the fleet of the Egyptian envoy delegation, the Theonia fleet The king chose this route for his safety).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The fleet sailed smoothly and without any trouble arrived at the coast of Cyrenaica.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Cyrenaica was once known to the world as a sub-state of Sparta, Theonia and Cyrenaica established friendship as early as Dionysius's cross-sea expedition to Theonia. relations, and this friendly relationship has been continuously strengthened over time. Of course, Cyrenaica has also consciously transformed from the initial equal status of both parties into a respectful attitude of a small country serving a big country.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since several waves of Theonian armies have passed through Cyrenaica since last year, the Cyrenaica people were not panicked and were even quite accustomed to it. However, when the envoys of the Theonian army informed Cyrenaica's senior officials When "King Davos was in the army", these Cyrenaica oligarchs hurriedly asked people to prepare generous supplies of gold, silver and military rations, and then rushed to the temporary camp near the port to visit.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos patiently had a friendly conversation with them, and made it clear in the conversation: Theonia will also do its best to ensure the political stability of Egypt during the war with Persia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   For the Cyrenaica people who had never been invaded by foreign enemies, the war between Theonia and the Persians had no impact on them. The only things that could affect the security of Cyrenaica were civil strife and famine, and what happened in Egypt The unrest will cause a large number of Libyans living in Egypt to flee westward, which will inevitably undermine the political stability of Cyrenaica. Although the Theonian army helped Egypt put down the rebellion last year, its new pharaoh has not been elected. This The oligarchs of Cyrenaica have always felt uneasy. Now with the guarantee of King Theonia, they can go back with confidence.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Theonia fleet rested for two days at the port of Cyrenaica, and then continued sailing eastward along the African coast. By mid-February, it finally arrived at the Egyptian coast.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While Davos was leading the fleet to walk and rest throughout the journey, the clipper ship that also set out from Thurii and served as a messenger had arrived in Egypt eight days ago, whether it was in Memphis or Assi Stetus, Tapyrus, and Chalcides in Perramesses all led their officials and rushed to the city of Naucratis.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Davos's ship successfully passed the checkpoint at the mouth of Peleucia, a tributary of the Nile River, and slowly sailed into the port, the Egyptian people who came to greet him gave a deafening cheer, which made Davos, who had not yet disembarked, also smile. Surprised.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After he stepped onto the dock, Asistes and others immediately greeted him and bowed respectfully.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "You have worked hard during this period. On behalf of the people of the kingdom, I would like to express my gratitude for your contribution to the kingdom!" Davos also solemnly returned the gift, then looked around at the densely packed Egyptian people outside and asked curiously: "This is Did you arrange it?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Because we were worried about safety issues, we didn't publicize it to the outside world. This was all their spontaneous behavior." Asistes hurriedly explained.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Oh!" Davos looked at the excited faces in the distance and asked with interest: "Are they from all over Egypt?" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   No, Your Majesty." Asiastus answered frankly: "Absolutely. Most of them come from this city and surrounding villages and towns."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Naukratis was a stronghold provided by the Egyptian pharaoh for Greek mercenaries hundreds of years ago, and later gradually developed into the only Hellenistic Egypt that often conducted trade with the Greeks. Town, most of the residents of the city have Greek ancestry, not to mention that most of the closer diplomatic and trade exchanges between Theonia and Egypt in the past 20 years have been carried out in this town, causing some Theonia citizens to settle here for a long time. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Precisely because of the uniqueness of the city of Naukratis, it was excluded and suppressed in the conservative Egyptian society. It was like an isolated island in the ocean and had no political influence on Egypt. This time, the Theonian reinforcements pacified Egypt. After the rebellion, they stayed for a long time without leaving, and even the recent decrees sent from Memphis to the towns in the Nile Delta had vague shadows of the Theonians. This made the sensitive Naucrates realize that the political situation in Egypt may have changed. Earth-shaking changes, this may be a great opportunity for them to stand up, so there is today's grand welcome scene. This is the Naukratis people showing their loyalty to the King of Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Of course Davos thought of this, and he felt slightly disappointed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, a voice sounded in his ear: "Your Majesty the King, in fact, the people in other towns in Egypt are also very happy for your arrival. It is just because of the long distance and the rush of time that they were unable to come here in time to welcome you, Your Majesty. On the way to Memphis, I believe you will be able to see with your own eyes the enthusiasm of other Egyptian people." The speaker stood beside Asistes, with dark skin, a slightly fat body, obvious wrinkles on his face, and a pinch of gray on his chin. He had a goatee, a slight bow on his upper body, and looked at Davos with a flattering smile.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos saw that he was wearing a pure white short-sleeved linen robe, a golden hat crown, and holding a slender cane. He had roughly guessed the identity of this person, but he still asked in surprise: " Who is this?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty, this is the high priest appointed by Pharaoh Tanib during his reign, Amenhotep from the Karak Temple. We received great help from him after we came to Egypt!" Assis Tes was busy making introductions.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos smiled: "I'm glad to see you. Asistes mentioned you many times in his letters to me. You have given us great support!" "His&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Majesty the King, I am glad to see you. It's my honor!" Amenhotep saluted respectfully and said passionately in slightly stiff Greek: "You are the son of Amun, the Lord of Upper and Lower Egypt. It is an honor for me to serve you, and also for the Egyptian people. It's an honor for you, so you don't have to be surprised that they gathered here, because from now on, the people of Egypt will listen to your teachings devoutly!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although Davos has already learned from Asistes' letter that this person's identity The distinguished high priest has completely fallen to Theonia, but his overly flattering attitude still surprised Davos, and he couldn't help but wonder: Was it because Theonia's powerful force frightened these pampered people? The Egyptian priests made their knees so weak!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   You must know that three months ago, the advance troops led by Chalcides not only eliminated the usurping Nectanipos, but also quickly suppressed rebellions in other towns in the Nile Delta, frightening Thebes, which was already a bit turbulent (not The city-state of Thebes in Greece, but the religious center of Upper Egypt) also quickly settled down.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Subsequently, starting in December last year, other legions in the Kingdom of Theonia arrived in Egypt one after another. Counting the first and second legions that arrived today, there are close to 20 Theonia legions in Egypt (including cavalry). Legion), a huge force of hundreds of thousands of people, coupled with its powerful combat effectiveness, is enough to destroy the entire Egypt. How could Amenhotep not feel trembling!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Most of the people at the port of Naukratis understood Greek. When they heard the high priest Amenhotep loudly pronounce the title "Son of Amun, King of Upper and Lower Egypt", there was an uproar at first, and then they burst into cheers. Then they all knelt down and shouted the name of "the great and noble Pharaoh Davos" in unison.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Facing the cheers of the Egyptian people, Davos did not forget about it. He knew very well that Amen Hotep called him so respectfully, which was actually a kind of test for him, so he said with a smile: "I am very grateful to the great Amen I have been given such an important mission, but Theonia has a vast territory and my energy is limited. I hope that the servants of God Amun can assist me in managing this ancient country together, so that the Egyptian people can once again bask in the radiance of God Amun's kindness. Under the circumstances."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos's direct and clear answer made Amenhotep breathe a sigh of relief, and he immediately expressed his position loudly: "All servants of Amun are willing to devote all their loyalty to the great Pharaoh!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the past few days The agreement reached after many negotiations between Moon Tapyrus and the Amun monks in Egypt was now confirmed by the commitment of Davos and Amenhotep, and the cooperation between the two parties was officially established.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Then, Davos came to the front of the kneeling people, motioned them to stand up, and said loudly: "Subjects of Egypt, Persia in the north has repeatedly sent troops to attack Egypt over the years in an attempt to occupy the land of the Nile River, and then turn you into slaves. Forcing you to give up your belief in Amun and turn to reform Ahura Mazda, and the Persians are behind the rebellion in Nectani Persia, and the situation in Egypt is already very dangerous!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So the great god Amun Let me become the new owner of this land, and I bring brave and fearless soldiers who will defend Egypt and defeat Persia, so that you can enjoy long-term peace and tranquility! Ensure that Egypt will always be the Egypt of Egyptians!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
