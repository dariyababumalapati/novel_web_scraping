   Chapter 1089 Plato's Praise&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plato smiled and said seriously: "My opinions have been expressed in previous scholars' conferences. If there are no updated things, how can I be embarrassed to stand on the podium again. Besides, this scholar's conference There were many young scholars who gave very exciting speeches, especially your son Apox. He made such amazing discoveries at such a young age, which is really enviable! And most of these young scholars came from your Theonia Academy. , it can be seen that your long-term investment in education in Theonia has finally begun to bear fruit. In comparison, other city-states, including our Athens, are far behind!" When saying this, Plato's face showed A bit worried.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Yesterday, Spisippus' speech also won praise from many scholars! Plato, you don't have to worry about having no successor at all!" Lysias consoled him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Spisippus stood up and thanked his elders.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plato was not modest at all. He pointed at his nephew and said: "Compared with the first Congress of Scholars, the current Spesippus has indeed made great progress, but he is still the only one in my academy so far. You can be called a 'young scholar', but your academy has emerged with many outstanding young scholars. This gap is huge!" "The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Theonia Academy is a public institution of the kingdom, funded by the Theonia Treasury. Funding and support, the best students are selected from the students graduating from schools in various towns and cities in the kingdom every year, and then further training is carried out. The natural success rate will be very high. The Akademi Academy is established with your personal investment, and is supported by funds, venues and teachers. Due to the limit on the number of students, you cannot recruit more students. This is of course incomparable.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, I heard that the reputation of Akademi Academy has begun to spread in the Eastern Mediterranean. I believe that there will gradually be more students from various Greek city-states. If outstanding young people are willing to study in your academy, the situation will be greatly improved." Lysias consoled him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plato sighed: "As I wrote in the book "The New Republic", 'If a country or a city-state wants to achieve sustained and prosperous development, it must first focus on good education. Education can not only enable young citizens to Have wisdom, and can cultivate them to have sound thoughts and morals from an early age. Only when the quality of citizens is improved and they know how to think, can the entire country develop healthily... 'Unfortunately,&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   we citizens of Athens do not think so, They only value immediate interests and hope to distribute the property in the treasury equally. Therefore, they unanimously agreed at the Citizens' Assembly a few years ago to implement the Citizens' Assembly subsidy system (that is, all Athenian citizens who attended the assembly were given half a drach at a time. Horses as compensation, as prices rose, this allowance also increased accordingly, and even extended to participating in other meetings to obtain allowance compensation).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After tasting the benefits of sharing the wealth of the city-state, they officially passed the "Implementation of Distribution Concept" the year before last The theater subsidy system' (during Athens celebrations, poor citizens were occasionally given subsidies for purchasing theater tickets. This tradition first began in the era of Pericles). For this purpose, a financial officer was specially established to manage the theater subsidies... ..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plato said rather worriedly: "Now that the citizens of Athens have enjoyed the benefits of sharing the wealth of the city-state, they hope that the city-state will issue subsidies more frequently and in greater amounts, and the remaining part of Athens' tax revenue will be less and less. The ability to cope with the economic situation is getting worse and worse. However, as Athenian citizens live more and more comfortably, they become unwilling to engage in arduous and dangerous military operations.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Some time ago, Conon's son Timothy was in the council He proposed, "The navy should be led to circumnavigate the Peloponnese Peninsula, attack the Spartan navy, and completely establish the superiority of the Athenian navy." The council approved his proposal, but did not allocate funds for the expedition, and the people did not join the army. Enthusiastic, Timothy had to raise money, hire soldiers, and pay remuneration to form a fleet for the expedition.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As a result, after conquering Corfu, the sailors refused to fight for him anymore due to lack of funds, and the entire military operation ended It ended in a hurry midway through. The military generals who encountered such difficulties were not only Timothy, but also Iphicrates and Cabrias... These relatively outstanding Athenian generals also suffered from military expenses. Restrictions have resulted in a series of military operations in Athens in recent years having little effect.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This has also resulted in outstanding generals who are willing to serve Athens having to often serve foreign monarchs, and it also makes them have enough money in their hands or the ability to borrow money. Supporting their military operations for Athens, Iphicrates not only often served the Thracians, but also married the daughter of a Thracian king. Timothy had a lot of influence in Ionia. With high reputation, they also married the daughter of a king of a city-state in Asia Minor...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In normal times, they spent more time abroad rather than in Athens, because then they had more freedom and could live a luxurious and flashy life. Without being criticized by public opinion. How much loyalty do they still have to Athens in the long run?!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This is simply a vicious circle! But the citizens of Athens cannot see these dangers. Most of them only value being able to watch the theater for free. , You can get money just by sitting in various venues every day... This is the most sad thing!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After hearing this, Davos didn't want to express his opinion on Athens' affairs, but he thought about it again and said seriously: "The Athenian government's unwillingness to spend money from the treasury to form an army to fight will lead to a worse result. The Athenian generals used the money they raised to pay the mercenaries. The mercenaries naturally obeyed the orders of the generals rather than the Athenian government. The Athenian government completely lost control of the army and could hardly order the army to implement the strategies it had formulated.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even if the general who leads the army still has some ambitions for Athens and orders the army to attack Athens, do you think these mercenaries will obey?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plato was stunned when he heard this, and slowly put down the wine glass that was brought to his mouth. After a while, he hesitated and said: "Although Timotheus and Iphicrates have some conflicts, these Athenian generals today still have a strong impression of Athens. Full of love... But you are right. Since the army serves the city-state, the city-state should of course pay the soldiers and protect their lives. Both parties have mutual obligations.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But if one party gives up this obligation, the other party will of course have the right not to perform this obligation...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The day before yesterday, I came to Turiyi and I had heard about the matter of 'Theonia raising taxes to form a border army'. The people of Onia are indeed very happy to have a strong and wise government!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plato took a sip of wine and didn't want to discuss this annoying issue anymore. He continued: "The reason why I came to Tulii at the end of the Scholars Conference this time is because I spent some time visiting Dionysus. Other towns in Asia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "profound!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Davos said with regret, "You should tell me in advance and let me make arrangements for you, so that your travel itinerary will be more convenient and safer.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I won't tell you, just so that I can roam more freely and make what I see with my eyes more real."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plato pointed to his eyes and asked narrowly: "Dear King Davos, you want to make arrangements for me, are you afraid that I will see something bad?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos smiled heartily: "You should know me, I have nothing to worry about.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Indeed, I should express congratulations to you!" Plato said with great interest: "I went to the south - Lilibi, the former Carthaginian military town, and also to the great city of Rome in the north. I spent two days in the central town of Bereventum... The land of Theonia is indeed vast, and it took me a lot of time just on the road.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, I want to correct what you just said, the king. It was safe all the way, whether it was by sea or land. I didn't encounter pirates or bandits, and I didn't see any war. Every place I passed seemed peaceful and peaceful, even in what the Greeks called "ferocious barbarism". The same is true in the territory of the Samnite people.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   You must know that more than ten years ago and more than twenty years ago, the Magna Graecia and Sicily regions had constant wars like mainland Greece. The wars between the Greek colonial city-states, the colonial city-states and The wars between the indigenous people, the wars between the Greek city-states and Carthage...the war conflicts in mainland Greece are still continuing, but to the west of the Adriatic Sea, it is a completely different scene. This is Dionis The existence of the Asian Kingdom brought great changes to the Western Mediterranean!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plato took another sip of wine and continued loudly: "I have to mention another important change. Although the journey is long, the transportation is very convenient, and the sea routes No matter how big or small the port towns I visited, their port facilities were relatively complete and their management was in order.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As for land roads, I have to mention that the roads you spent a lot of money on treasury and built are smooth, wide and solid. Even if They still exist in the continuous mountains of Samnai and Lucania. You also build roads in the territories of allies such as the Volscians and Campanians... Oh, you call them The 'road network' is indeed a network that connects most ethnic groups in the Italian peninsula, providing great convenience for their travel and trade, and also allowing people of all ethnic groups to strengthen exchanges.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   I When walking on the road, there is always an endless stream of pedestrians on the road. Most of their faces have an optimistic spirit. I see a desire on their faces, which forces them to appear in a hurry. This is true whether you are driving a pack car or carrying a package, but this rush is not because of poverty, but for a better life...and this desire is exactly what the Kingdom of Theonia has given you!"&#13;
