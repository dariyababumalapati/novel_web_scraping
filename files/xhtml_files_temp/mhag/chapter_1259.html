   Chapter 1259 Entrance Ceremony (3)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In order to win the favor of the Megara people, the Corinthians also proposed that "when merchants from other city-states transport goods through the isthmus, the taxes and fees collected will be equally divided between the two city-states, and Megara Merchants can have priority in using the towpath, and the fees charged can also be discounted"... (The towpath is a famous infrastructure project built by the Corinthians 200 years ago. It is a stone paved road built on the Isthmus of Corinth. , there are two roads with parallel grooves in the middle. Special vehicles run on this road. The wheel tracks exactly correspond to the grooves. This road connects the Gulf of Corinth and the Gulf of Saron. The Corinthians can move one side The cargo of the big ship in the bay is first loaded onto the small boat, and then the small boat is lifted to the car on the towway, transported to the bay on the other side of the isthmus, and then the cargo on the ship is moved to another large ship. This greatly (shortening the voyage and saving time)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The sincerity shown by the Corinthians gradually moved Megara's heart. The two sides have begun to discuss the establishment of an alliance, but in today's mainland Greece, you cannot establish an alliance if you want to. The consent of the Greek Union must be obtained.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Corinthian member of the Greek Parliament was worried that the Corinthian Council's foolish performance at this games would anger the King of Theonia, causing him to no longer agree to the proposal of "Corinth establishing an Isthmian Union."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just when Corinthian general Cleonian was regretting it, Megacides, who was standing at the entrance of the arena, heard the thunderous cheers inside and was already a little excited, because it was their turn to enter next.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the Theonian officials in front of the entrance saw the Corinthian athletes walking past the royal stands, they shouted: "The delegation of Cretan athletes is entering!" The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Theonian soldiers blocking the front immediately gave way. On the road, the impatient Cretan athletes immediately followed the boy holding the sign. When passing the Theonian official in charge of the admission order, he encouraged him as friendly as before: "Crete Warriors, hold your heads high and welcome the enthusiastic cheers from the audience!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As soon as Megakides stepped into the arena, the earth-shaking cheers immediately came from all directions, just like the sea under harsh conditions. The strong winds roared, and the towering auditorium surrounding them was the huge waves. How could they not be frightened when they were in the center of the storm? No wonder the Theonian official called them warriors, because they dared to be in such a Courage is indeed required in such an environment. Even Megakides, who had always been determined in the Crete trials, felt nervous at the moment. After all, the momentum and scale of the Hades main arena were far beyond those in the previous trials. It is incomparable, not to mention that there will be very few visitors from Crete here.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Silitaos, who was relatively nervous, didn't seem to be affected much. He kept looking around and exclaimed from time to time: "Wow, it seems that the rumors are true. Some of the audience members are women!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Look! That distance over there The young woman wearing a white hat who is very close to us looks very nice!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "The woman in purple clothes should be of noble origin!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 ---&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Silitaos' words gradually relieved the restraints of his teammates, and they He began to imitate Silitaos and smiled and waved to the audience while commenting on each other.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As he approached the royal stand, Megakides jokingly whispered: "Look, Siliteos, the Princess Theonia you want to marry is up there!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Siliteos suddenly stopped talking. , his expression became solemn. When he reached the front of the royal stand, he stopped and bowed respectfully towards the royal stand.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It is not that the previous delegations that entered the stadium did not salute to the royal stands, but they were all athletes from Theonia, and they all performed chest-beating salutes, because most of them served in the Theonia army. Citizens, King Davos is their supreme commander.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now, athletes from a Greek city-state are paying traditional Greek respect to the royal family of Theonia. Not only are the audience surprised, but also Davos and his family.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Your Majesty the King, it seems that your sports meeting has not officially started yet, and it has already been recognized by some athletes." Plato said with a smile.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I think what these athletes agree with is the high bonuses." Xenophon sneered.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos replied with emotion: "Since the establishment of the Olympia Games, the four major games have not only been popular in the Greek world for hundreds of years, but have also been widely spread among other races in the Mediterranean. Unfortunately, they have been unable to join them. Now Theonia provides such an opportunity, allowing races other than Greece to participate in such a grand ceremony, and at the same time allowing excellent Greek athletes to show their superb competitive skills to the entire Mediterranean. I think-this is probably what happened just now. A Greek athlete must agree with the root cause of the Theonian Games!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I think the significance of the establishment of the Theonian Games is probably more than that." Plato said thoughtfully: "I remember that Dionysius distributed it to various city-states. The invitation letter solemnly mentioned, 'The Theonian Games will follow the fine traditions of the major Greek competitions and require participating countries to stop all acts of war during the games and maintain a peaceful competition environment...'. Look at the people on the field. Athletes, they are not just from Greece, but include most city-states and countries in the Mediterranean. What does this request of Theonia mean?!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plato emphasized his tone and said excitedly: "It means Theonia Nia wants to extend the peace of Greece to the entire Mediterranean! What a great ambition! If it can be realized, it will be an unprecedented achievement!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plato, you are too excited." Xenophon said calmly: " Are there not many wars and conflicts that have occurred during the Games in the past few decades! Not to mention that the Theonian Games are held for the first time. Do you want to extend this Greek tradition to the entire Mediterranean? Just talking, if you want to achieve it... haha... ..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked calm, but said in a powerful tone: "Theonia has always kept its promise. Since she dares to say this, she is naturally determined to fulfill this promise! If any participating city-state or race violates what is stated in the letter, For this request, no matter how far the journey is, Theonia will send troops to punish it to ensure the prestige of the Theonia Games!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Looking at Davos's deep gaze, Xenophon's heart trembled slightly, He said stubbornly: "Extending peace to the Mediterranean... This is indeed a good wish, but don't forget Persia!" "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Yes, there is Persia..." Davos's face changed when he heard this. There was no hint of embarrassment, but a thoughtful sigh.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since Silitaos saluted, the Dionyian audience gave even louder cheers to the delegation of Cretan athletes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Siriteos looked a little proud and said to his teammates: "Did you see that the audience is cheering for me!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Megakides curled his lips. He felt that the reason why this guy saluted just now was purely to attract attention!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the admission of the Cretan athlete delegation, the Crotone region, the Dauni region, Thebes, Egypt... Athlete delegations from city-states and regions entered the arena one after another. The enthusiasm of the audience was always high and the cheers continued. The entrance ceremony lasted for an hour. Finally, all 79 delegations and nearly 3,000 athletes stood in the center of the arena.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   A very small number of Greek city-state envoys, headed by representatives from Olympia, looked at the densely packed athletes in the stadium, their faces looking ugly. They had previously despised the fact that Theonia was going to host the sports games, and thought from the bottom of their hearts that "an unorthodox Greek country without any foundation - &#226;&#128;&#148;It is impossible for Theonia to hold a sports meeting successfully." But seeing such a huge number of athletes in the venue, it is not only a little discolored, because this is obviously several times more than the number of participants in any previous sports meeting, which means that Daionia The Onia Games are far more influential than they give them credit for.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, the red flag was raised again on the hosting platform, and the powerful voices of the hosts echoed in the stadium: "Dear athletes, distinguished guests, we all know that in ancient times, Prometheus stole from the Kingdom of Olympus. The holy fire descended to earth. From then on, we humans began to escape from barbarism and ignorance, and gradually moved towards prosperity and civilization. Fire has also become a sacred thing respected by any family and any city-state.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even if people are forced to stay away from home for life, they will always stay in their mother country They took away a bunch of sacred fire from the temple and made every effort to ensure that it burned forever on the way, and finally rekindled it on the altar in the temple of their new home thousands of miles away... Only in this way will they firmly believe in Pilu Lanlv The newly built new home has been blessed by the gods, and the civilization of the mother country will continue to be passed down here. This is the fundamental reason why the Greek city-state priests are like the stars in the sky, spread all over the Mediterranean, and are still closely connected!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Today, The Theonia Games will also hold a sacred ceremony! The sacred fire in the main temple of Hades in the Kingdom of Theonia will light the altar in the stadium. During the Games, the altar flame will burn forever, and Hades will Lead the gods to bless the games to be held smoothly and fairly, bless the athletes to achieve excellent results, and will severely punish any hostile behavior that disrupts the games!...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Now everyone please remain silent and wait for the heroes of the Kingdom of Theonia with peace of mind. Bring the flame to the arena!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Olympian representative was stunned for a moment when he heard this, and then became angry: Theonia had promised in the invitation letter that the purpose of this games would never be to please Hades, but it will soon The ceremony held to invite the sacred fire from the main temple of Hades is a disguised use of the sports meeting to make sacrifices for Hades. This is deception!&#13;
