   Chapter 1292 Battle of Asia Minor (End)&#13;
  </font>&#13;

 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Reporting to your lord commander, the cavalry on the Persian left wing has been completely defeated!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After receiving the good news from the messenger, Leoticides still looked serious: Pass my order, right wing The cavalry and Epirus pelts immediately attacked the Persian flank!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He knew very well: According to the situation he knew before, although the left cavalry of the Persian army lost the opportunity, they performed very bravely in the difficult situation. Although their own cavalry and light shield soldiers worked together to defeat it, they themselves They also paid a heavy price. But this is not the time to rest, because judging from the entire battle situation, although the coalition forces have the upper hand, they will not be able to defeat the Persians for a while, and Persian archers continue to shoot from behind the army formation. However, the arrows continued to consume a lot of energy of the soldiers at the rear of their own army formation, affecting their strong support for the soldiers at the front of the array.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even more troublesome were the thousands of cavalry on the Persian right wing. Although the Theonian light armored soldiers and The light infantry has been mixed together, with its back to the main force of the Greek coalition, and is arranged in a loose formation. It is paying close attention to the movements of the Persian cavalry and is ready to defend against its surprise attack on the rear of the main force of the coalition. However, the speed of the Persian cavalry After all, if they really want to move quickly on a large scale, the light armor and light infantry can only fall behind. And at the critical moment, their desperate all-out assault may bring big trouble to the entire battle, so he hopes to be able to move as soon as possible. Establishing the chance of victory.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides was thinking about the entire battle while paying attention to the battle ahead. At this moment, his guard captain suddenly shouted: "Your Majesty Commander, the Persian cavalry is charging towards us!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leotichides hurriedly turned around and saw countless Persian cavalry that had been cruising in the distance galloping in his direction. The light infantry fired arrows and javelins at them, and Persian cavalry continued to attack them. They fell off their horses, but they did not retreat again like before, but instead accelerated their advance.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides's face changed slightly: his worries came true, but the target of the opponent's surprise attack turned out to be himself... The commander-in-chief of the Greek coalition forces.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As a former Spartan warrior, he does not lack courage. However, as the commander-in-chief of the coalition forces, there must be no accidents at the most important moment of the battle. He cannot let the coalition flag held high next to him be taken away. This greatly affected the morale of the soldiers, so he did not hesitate to lead the escort to the place where the light armored soldiers and light infantry were concentrated. The officers of this mixed unit also felt the crisis and loudly called for the soldiers to gather. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Facing the enemy in front, this Persian cavalry unit, which was mainly composed of light cavalry, no longer chose to dodge as before. Instead, it hugged the horse's neck tightly, accelerated the horse's speed, and rushed straight towards the opponent.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This indomitable momentum Many Theonian soldiers felt palpitations. The team officers shouted "The Name of Hades" to stabilize the morale of the troops, and at the same time commanded the light infantry to immediately carry out long-range attacks to hinder the enemy's charge. Those who&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   were shot by arrows The war horses rolled to the ground with the cavalry on their backs in mourning, and were trampled into pulp by the Persian cavalry following closely behind...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although the long-range attack of the Theonian light infantry failed to repel the Persian cavalry , but it also slowed down their charging speed and gave the light armored soldiers time to form a hasty formation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Facing the Persian cavalry who rushed forward with amazing momentum, the Theonian light armored soldiers still raised their arms despite their pale faces. A dense array of leather shields stood in front of them.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Peng!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Peng!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Peng!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ..." Theonian soldiers were constantly being knocked away, bringing down their surrounding comrades, but there were also soldiers who came to join the interception array. Amidst the continuous screams and exclamations, Dionisia Although Asia's array was shattered, it never collapsed, and the charge of the Persian cavalry was finally contained...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides had been paying attention to the battle situation behind him. At this time, not only was he relieved, but he also felt happy in his heart. He knew very well that once the swift Persian cavalry lost their speed, if they did not retreat in time, the only thing waiting for them would be destruction. He could finally devote all his attention to the battle ahead.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166; &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   On the right wing of the Greek coalition formation, the two adjacent elite troops-the Spartan warriors and the Theban Holy Army, due to their past grievances, In order to prove that they are stronger than each other, they compete with each other, but their enemies are under great pressure.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, the attack from the flanks by the coalition cavalry and light shield soldiers became the last straw that broke the camel's back, and the Persian soldiers began to retreat...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although It will take a certain amount of time for a small local defeat to affect the military formation that is seven or eight miles long. Perhaps during this period, the Persian army may have other turning points.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But Fanabazo who learned the news Si obviously did not have this kind of luck. With the left, center, and right routes at a disadvantage and no reinforcements available, the defeat was obviously determined. He immediately and decisively issued the order to "retreat." The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Persian soldiers When they heard the sound of the trumpet, they immediately turned around and ran away, and the coalition soldiers took advantage &#13;
      of&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   the opportunity to cover up and kill them. The entire battlefield was like a dam bursting, with rivers flowing in&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   all directions. The tens of thousands of Greek mercenaries in the middle not only reacted slowly, but also had a slow speed due to their thick armor that affected their hearing. It was also slow and fell behind, becoming the best target for the coalition soldiers to pursue.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, Jason could no longer care about the mercenaries he had spent several years training hard. He threw away his eye-catching helmet and heavy wearing a breastplate, riding his own war horse, and quickly fled the battlefield with complicated emotions just like he fled Greece a few years ago...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At dusk, the coalition soldiers who had stopped pursuing the pursuit were cleaning the battlefield. They stripped off the armor and weapons from the corpses. , or finding valuable items from the prisoners, they always couldn't help laughing...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The coalition generals gathered together in twos and threes, happily looking at the battlefield littered with corpses, while excitedly discussing the previous battles .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And Leoticides was sitting alone on the hillside with his eyes closed, and when he heard footsteps beside him, he thought of it. He asked directly without opening his eyes: "What's the loss?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Muklu, the staff officer of the Greek coalition forces and Leoticides' old partner, said in a deep voice: "According to preliminary statistics, we have more than 6,400 casualties, including 1,300 cavalry casualties, and the mortality rate is as high as 60%. , there were more than 3,000 light infantrymen, with a mortality rate of only 30%, and light armored soldiers of more than 1,000, with a mortality rate of only 30%... Most of the remaining casualties in the heavy infantry were allied soldiers, and the one with the highest number of casualties was-Spar, who lined up alone. Da warrior.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leotichides suddenly opened his eyes and turned to look at Muklu.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Muklu seemed to have expected this reaction from him, and continued without changing his expression: "According to the report of the messenger, the Spartans indeed performed very bravely in this battle. They were the first to defeat the enemy in person. Of course, he also paid the price of nearly a hundred casualties..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides did not speak, but quietly tore off a piece of grass beside him with his right hand.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "There's one more thing... I think you should know..." Muklu whispered hesitantly: "Agesilaus is dead..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides suddenly widened his eyes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Muklu's voice dropped even lower: "I heard that after the Persians were defeated, Agesilaus, who was sitting behind the Spartan army and commanding, was so excited that he wanted to follow the soldiers in pursuit, but he fell down. , never got up again..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The old guy finally died... The barrier that had been pressing on Leoticides's heart all year round suddenly disappeared, but at this moment he did not feel relaxed, but felt a little empty in his heart. He looked around the battlefield with a sense of loss, and finally fixed his sight on a corner on the left side of the battlefield: there were hundreds of strong men with long braids and bare upper bodies, bowing their heads solemnly and praying for something. In front of them was Among the rows of corpses, there must be the remains of Agesilaus...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Leoticides thought to himself, but did not go over to pay homage with them. He just sat quietly, with the memories of yesterday echoing in his ears. What Agesilaus said when he left in the evening...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just as he was lost in thought, Muklu's report continued: "The Persians left nearly 6,000 corpses and wounded soldiers on the battlefield, most of which were cavalry. . We also captured more than 6,000 defeated soldiers, most of whom were Greek mercenaries..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Yalitaka, a A well-known Tyrian noble, he once led the Tyrian fleet twice and followed the Persian army to conquer Egypt. He also made contributions in quelling the rebellion in western Asia Minor and was rewarded by the King of Persia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, after the turmoil broke out in Egypt, the Persian king who wanted to take the opportunity to recapture Egypt obviously did not forget him. He sent a messenger to Phoenicia and asked the Phoenician city-states to gather all their warships and command them under the command of Alitaka. Cooperate with the preparations of the Persian army to attack Egypt.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But not long after, the Holy Kingdom of Theonia declared war on Persia, and then the Theonia army landed in Egypt, quelled the unrest, and stayed for a long time. Its troops were even stationed in Perrameses, threatening Gaza. Security... etc. A series of news came one after another in more than two months, making the entire Near East region tense.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   During this period, Persia, which was undergoing comprehensive military mobilization, required coastal areas such as Cyprus, Syria, and Issus to gather the warships owned in their areas to the military ports of Tire and Sidon, form a unified Persian fleet, and appoint Ya Litaka was the commander-in-chief of the Persian fleet and asked him to lead the fleet to guard the Near East waters and prevent the invasion of the Theonian fleet.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Yalitaka, who was given the sole responsibility for the first time, was naturally very diligent. He sent envoys many times to urge Cyprus, Syria and other regions to provide warships as soon as possible, and at the same time, he seized the time to reorganize and train his warships.&#13;
