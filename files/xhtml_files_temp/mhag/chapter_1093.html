   Chapter 1093: What I saw and heard at the Craty River (continued)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Henipolis smiled even brighter: "It is an honor for me to be praised by Lord Hakkar! I will definitely talk to you more when I have the opportunity in the future... Uh, Your Majesty I'm still waiting at the dock with the elders, and I'd like to ask Mr. Haka to get on the boat with me and rush to the inner city!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Okay!" Haka responded simply.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Henepolis glanced behind him and asked: "Where is Master Hasdrubal?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka said calmly: "He drank too much along the way and is sleeping soundly in the cabin. It is estimated that he will be more serious in the inner city." It's hard to wake up."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Oh..." Henipolis nodded and was about to speak.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, the river official came over and whispered a few words in his ear, and he immediately showed an understanding look and said: "Then let Mr. Hades Druba have a good rest, and I won't disturb him."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Heni .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Boris led Haka onto the ship and onto the wooden building. Haka looked far away from a high place, and suddenly felt that his field of vision was much wider. He could cross the pier on the shore and see the overlapping houses and the bustling flow of people behind.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just when the surrounding ships were intentionally or unintentionally approaching, curious to see what kind of noble person the king's ship could come out to greet, the double-headed dragon ship had already turned its bow, and two speedboats were clearing the way ahead. , with the full strength of hundreds of sailors, began to move up the current, and the passenger ship that Haka was originally on followed closely behind.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The city of Tutuli is different from the city of Rome. The city of Rome is dozens of miles away from the mouth of the river, and the river is winding. Boats going upstream from the mouth of the river must rely on hauling to reach the river port outside the city, while the city of Tutuli is only five or six miles away from the mouth of the river. Here, the main body of the city is located downstream after the confluence of the Krati River and the Kosseni River. The river channel is wide and the water flow is gentle. Under normal circumstances, ships can go upstream to the city of Thurii without relying on fiber pullers.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka stood on the wooden building where the ship was sitting and saw the situation on both sides of the river more clearly: Indeed, as the river officials said, the Turiyi people transformed both sides of the river into docks, and not only all the river beaches were covered with solid stone slabs. Covered, and every 10 meters or so, there is a 5-meter-high trapezoidal stone platform standing on the shore.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There is a stone ring at both ends of each stone platform. There is a wooden instrument parked on the stone platform. It extends a long wooden arm toward the river, with pulleys and ropes hanging on the wooden arm. An iron hook came out, the end of the wooden arm was clamped by two huge wooden wheels, and the other end of the rope was tied tightly to the ground, looking like a huge snail...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka knew that this was Theonia The crane invented by Man has long been famous in the Western Mediterranean, but it has not yet spread to the port towns in southern Iberia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka carefully observed the entire process of unloading the cargo ship: the cargo ship slowly docked at the riverside in front of the stone platform, and laborers from the shore went over to tie the cables at both ends of the cargo ship to the stone holes at both ends of the stone platform. Incoming cargo ships will approach the dock.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The person operating the crane lowers the wooden arm, relaxes the rope, and lowers the hook.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The crew hung baskets of goods on the iron hooks, and then the slaves in the wooden wheels of the crane laboriously stepped on the wooden wheels. The wooden wheels quickly rotated, tightened the ropes, and the iron hooks lifted the goods high and separated from the cargo ship.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, the people on both sides of the crane pulled the ropes, controlled the wooden arms, and slowly parked the goods on the flat ground in front of the stone platform... The whole process was fast, labor-saving, and efficient, and a ship full of goods was unloaded in no time. Even after half of the fall, both the crew and the workers on the shore seemed very relaxed.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka also noticed that there were semi-open warehouses not far behind these stone platforms. The goods unloaded from the ships were transported to these warehouses by laborers for parking.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Behind this simple warehouse, there are huge rectangular, closed warehouses lined up side by side. Each one has a roof about 6 meters high and multiple arches 4 meters high. The area is no less than two arenas. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And through the small window at the top, you can see that the walls of the warehouse are quite thick.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Only such high-quality warehouses can reassure cargo owners about the safety of their goods. At the same time, they can store more goods and facilitate the shipment of goods...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Regarding the process of cargo ships entering the port, Mr. Li, who has led the government affairs in southern Iberia for many years, Haka is very clear: after workers at the dock unload the goods, they park them in a temporary warehouse. The ship owner will immediately go to the port to spend money to rent a storage room in the warehouse, and then pay the workers to transfer his goods to the warehouse for storage. , and then go to the market in the city to contact the buyer... This process usually takes two or three days. Of course, if the buyer is contacted in advance, the situation will be much better.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But like Thurii, the unloading docks, temporary warehouses, and warehouses are close together, which is undoubtedly much more convenient.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   And Haka judged based on this: With the way the Turiyi people behave, the Turiyi Market, which is famous throughout the Western Mediterranean, is probably not far from here (and this is indeed the case).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He couldn't help but sigh, but Henepolis was greeted with curiosity: "Master Haka, what do you think of coming to Turii?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka pointed to the pier on the shore and sighed sincerely: "Look These stone piers, temporary warehouses, and cargo warehouses where cranes are placed are neatly lined up on both sides of the Krati River like armies, stretching forward with almost no end in sight. How spectacular it is! I don't think any outsider can see it. Seeing such a scene, one has to admire the power of the Kingdom of Theonia, and dare not have any thoughts of confronting it!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Henipolis looked at him, then turned to look at the shore: "To tell you a truth An interesting anecdote. Lysias, a famous scholar in the kingdom, was once preparing to write an article describing the docks on the Craty River. He decided to go to the docks by the river to inspect it first, and returned not long after. His&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   friend asked him, "Why?" So fast?'&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   He said, 'I arrived at the river and found that the dock was full of people, very busy, the sound was extremely noisy and harsh, the cranes creaked, the cows and donkeys kept braying, and the grumpy porters There was a loud roar... and the air was also very bad, mixed with the smell of wine, olive oil, and people's sweat... I stood there for a while, and then I felt my head swelled uncomfortably, and I struggled with the help of the servants. I had to push aside those who were blocking my way, and finally got out. And in the process, I stepped on donkey manure twice...'"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka couldn't help but laugh when he heard this.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Henipolis sighed, looked into the distance in ecstasy, and murmured: "I still miss Turiyi more than ten years ago, especially the Krati River, which is clear, quiet, and fascinating... Alas, but Now, not only are the rivers crowded and noisy, but the water has also become turbid, and there are still a lot of boats sailing at night..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka sighed on the side: "However, every city-state and country hopes that their city will be like this. , because it means prosperity and strength."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Henipolis patted the ship's railing with both hands and smiled again: "This is why I am just a clerk and you are the great governor! But I suggest that after you settle down in Turiyi, you'd better go to Buy a piece of land in the mountains to the north, build a villa, and live there several times a month. The air there is fresh and quiet, which is good for your health..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While the two were talking and laughing, a huge building came into view in the distance ahead. When Haka saw it: a hundred-meter-long stone bridge lay across the wide Krati River, like a giant beast overlooking the passing ships.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This should be the Thurii Stone Bridge. It is said to be the first stone bridge built in the Western Mediterranean. It is indeed very spectacular!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ...Haka looked ahead, but heard Henepolis say: "We are about to enter the inner city dock."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Following the direction of Henepolis's finger, Haka saw the road across the overlapping rivers. Walls between buildings.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Originally there was a river chain here..." Henipolis pointed to the tower on the river bank in front, but looked at Haka beside him, and said seemingly casually: "It was abandoned more than ten years ago. It was used, but when the war broke out with... Carthage, it was used urgently. But now it has been completely abandoned, because there will no longer be enemies threatening the kingdom from the sea."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka nodded calmly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "In recent years, there have been senators who proposed to 'remove the entire inner wall.' Fortunately, most of the senators expressed their opposition and it was not passed. Otherwise, the city of Turiyi would really be unstoppable!" Haka watched for&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   a while and understood. Why does Henipolis say this? He has seen that the neighborhoods within the city walls are far less dense than those outside the city walls, and the houses are neat and spacious. The pedestrians are relatively sparse, but they appear leisurely and comfortable, as if the city is another world...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But there is only one The busier place is the inner city dock ahead where the ship is sailing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Compared with the long queue-like river piers I saw before, the inner city pier is too small, with only six piers, but each berth is extremely spacious, more than enough to berth large ships dozens of meters tall, and the piers are all made of It is paved with stone slabs and can accommodate two carriages passing side by side. It is also equipped with several stone platforms and cranes...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There is a large waiting area at the back of the pier, which is specially equipped with a long colorful cloth shed to provide shade. Also for the sake of beauty.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There are rows of comfortable seats under the cloth tent, and they are now full of people.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Haka's eyes quickly searched among the crowd on the shore. When he saw the man who was dressed the same as others, except that he wore a small dazzling gold crown on his head, Haka was excited. I also suddenly felt a little nervous.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Davos, who was in the waiting area, saw the ship entering the dock, he immediately stood up and led the elders to the trestle.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After the wooden ladder to get off the ship was set up, Haka refused the help of the slave this time, slowly walked off the ship, came to Davos, bowed deeply, and said: "Dear Davos Your Majesty, Haka, the former governor of southern Iberia and your loyal student, has arrived to report to you!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
