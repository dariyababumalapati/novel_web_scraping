   Chapter 1260 Admission Ceremony (4)&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But the representative of Olympia did not dare to shout loudly. He could not forget the terrible scene of the Theonian army surrounding the city of Olympia a few years ago, for fear of angering Theonia in this public place and once again fighting for Olympia. If it brings disaster, we can only whisper to the representatives of the surrounding city-states, hoping to attract their attention and jointly protest to Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, these representatives either said that this ceremony was meaningful and worth seeing, or they pretended not to hear it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even if someone agrees with his statement, they have not made it clear that they will protest to Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The entire venue gradually became quiet under the supervision and reminders of the Theonia audience and athletes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Not long after, "Dang!...Dang!...Dang!..." The powerful and thick bells reached the main arena, making the people of Theonia look solemn.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The place where the bells rang - the Hill of the Gods - was already surrounded by many devout followers of Hades.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the nine bells rang, the old Plessinas walked out of the main temple tremblingly, holding high the torch lit by the holy fire. They all sang the hymn of Hades devoutly, and the whole inner city I was immediately immersed in the light and melodious singing.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, Sekerian, wearing a pure white singlet, came forward with a solemn expression.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plesinas said gently: "General, please take it!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian didn't say much, just nodded heavily, then solemnly took the burning torch with both hands, turned around and ran down the mountain.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thurii people stood densely on both sides of the road, forming a human-shaped corridor leading directly to the main arena.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   While they sang, they watched excitedly as Sekerian ran forward holding the torch high.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Sekerian, who quickly ran down the mountain, handed the torch to Tegetus who was waiting, and Tegetus continued to run to the next torch bearer... The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   distance from the main temple of Hades to the main arena is approximately Even if the torchbearers run at full speed, it will take them a while to reach the six-mile distance.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The hosts in the arena used this time to introduce the heroic deeds of the torchbearers to the audience who could not see the torch relay, and their heroic deeds were actually a war history of Theonia from weak to strong. , which made the Theonian audience excited when they relived the history, and also made foreign people, envoys, and athletes who heard this for the first time sigh.&#13;
  </font>&#13;

   "&#226;&#128;&#166;The last hero to enter the main arena with a torch was Brutus Max. He was a Roman and later became Theonian citizen.&#13;

  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the Greek War that broke out in the 24th year of the kingdom (370 BC), the Theonian army and the Spartan coalition fought a decisive battle on the Tegean plain. Due to the Tegean people The sudden rebellion of the First Legion, as the main offensive force, was attacked by the Spartan coalition forces. The situation was very critical. However, the soldiers of the First Legion fought bloody and withstood the fierce attack of the Spartan warriors and persisted until reinforcements arrived. The arrival of Max finally turned the tide of the war. However, the losses of the First Army were quite heavy. When cleaning the battlefield after the battle, the medical staff unexpectedly discovered that Max was still alive. The&#13;

 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   unit led by this First Army captain was in the middle of the battle. At the forefront, all the soldiers of the entire squadron died heroically, and the squadron leader fell in the center of the phalanx, next to the team flag. There was a circle of Spartan warriors lying around him, and his whole body Bathed in blood, falling into a coma, and even his limbs were incomplete. After many rescues by doctors, and with the blessing of Hades, he finally came back to life... After hearing about&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   his deeds, the great His Majesty Davos was very moved. He was immediately appointed as the hero of the kingdom, but his injury was too serious. Even if the triumphal ceremony of this war was held a year later, he would not be able to attend! But today, he will hold a torch and use the holy fire to light the altar on the field, This is to remind the audience here not to forget that it was the bloodshed and sacrifice of these Theonian soldiers on the battlefield that led to the establishment of the Greek Union! Only peace in mainland Greece! Only today's grand sports meeting celebration! So we should be sincerely grateful to warriors like Max!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After several pre-rehearsals, the experienced hosts controlled the time very well, so not long after they finished speaking, a figure appeared at the entrance of the arena. .&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Brutus Max was once a handsome Roman young man. He is only in his 30s now, but he can no longer see his former appearance at all. The left side of his face seemed to have been bitten by something. A big piece was missing, including his left eye, his right hand was missing at shoulder level, his left leg seemed to be shorter, and he limped a lot when he ran... The whole person looked quite scary.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But the Theonian audience all stood up in unison and applauded with solemn expressions. Nearly half of these Theonian audiences were Turiyi people. Almost all of them shed tears and cried uncontrollably because they saw Marx. It made them involuntarily think of their relatives who died or were injured in the Greek war.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   This scene made the envoys of the Greek city-states unable to help but feel moved, and they all stood up and applauded him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ipamironda sighed: "The Kingdom of Theonia admires citizens who fight bravely so much, how can their citizens not fight bravely! This is the fundamental reason why the Theonia army is strong! "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "After seeing this, we should feel more relieved!" Lycomedes also sighed: "Because as long as Theonia remains strong, the Greek Alliance can exist for a longer time!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In a very small number of futures, Among those who stood up and applauded, the most obvious one was Agesilaus, because in the host's speech just now, the Spartan warriors seemed to have become evil beings, but Agesilaus, who was already seventy years old, did not He did not feel any anger, and he knew clearly that the rise and fall of a city-state has always been about the winner and the loser. If Sparta won the Battle of Tegea in the end, it may be a different situation today, but precisely because there are countless people like him. Diorian soldiers like Max fought bravely, which ultimately led to the failure of the military plan he tried his best to draw up, so he looked at the staggering figure on the track in silence, with a rather complicated mood...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos and His family members also stood up. They all looked solemn and applauded silently. The corners of the eyes of several women such as Christoya and Cynthia were wet. Even Aedui's voice was choked...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Plato and Xeno, who had been arguing endlessly before ,&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Fendu remained silent knowingly. They already knew that Davos's adopted son Adoris died in the battle of Tegea. Obviously, the torchbearer who entered the arena made the royal family of Theonia return to life. Recall that painful past.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this moment, Max's condition is a bit bad. Not only is his body mutilated, but his body covered by a white singlet is also scarred. The two most important injuries are that his left and right lungs were stabbed by Spartan soldiers' spears. Wearing will lead to a great decrease in lung function. If you exercise for a little longer, you will feel that your breath is not enough and it is difficult to support it.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The preparatory team discovered this problem and considered changing the candidate, but Max repeatedly promised Clotokatax that "he will definitely be able to complete the task."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After several rehearsals, he did persevere, so whether it was for political reasons or personal emotional reasons, Clotokatax would never change the person who lit the altar fire.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But today is different from the usual rehearsals. Thousands of spectators are watching and accompanied by thunderous applause. The passion in Max's heart, which has been worse than death in the past few years, is ignited by the fierce atmosphere of the stadium: Yes, he is carrying the burden of The expectations of the families of the hundreds of comrades who died in Tegea will ignite this sacred fire so that their brave and fearless souls will be praised by the people of the entire Mediterranean!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   His heart was beating violently, his steps were speeding up unconsciously, and the consumption of his whole body was obviously higher than usual rehearsals. Max was out of breath, his eyes were black, and his body was shaking. It seemed that every step he took might cause him to fall. fall.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Hold on Marx, you must hold on!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Your comrades are watching you at the Elysee, waiting for the great moment when you light the flame!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   There are still dozens of meters to go, so keep on holding on!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   !&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ...Max kept cheering himself up, suppressing the nervousness rising in his heart.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, the entire venue suddenly became quiet, and everyone's eyes were focused on the swaying torchbearer on the track. The distance of tens of meters seemed very short, but seemed very long to him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Even Davos couldn't help but grasp the railings of the stands, and Clotokatax had his worries written on his face: So far, everything in the opening ceremony has gone smoothly, but if Max falls, even the flame will go out. , then all previous efforts will be in vain, and the novel opening ceremony of the Theonian Games will also become a laughing stock.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But Clotokatax did not regret at this moment that he chose Max as the candidate to light the altar. In order to encourage him and himself, he even cursed in his heart: "Those who died fighting for the First Legion" brother!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   For my big brother!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Max, hold on the fuck!&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  ---&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The prayers of thousands of Theonian spectators seemed to have no effect, and Max's body shook even more.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Just when everyone couldn't bear to watch anymore, the boy holding the sign standing at the front of the referee team suddenly handed the raised wooden sign to Kalsidis behind him, and then ran towards Max quickly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Immediately afterwards, another boy holding a sign not far from him ran over.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Two flawless teenagers supported a disabled veteran and jogged together towards the altar in the center of the field. This harmonious scene immediately aroused enthusiastic applause from the audience outside the field, and also made a few viewers feel gloomy. .&#13;
