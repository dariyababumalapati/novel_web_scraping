   Chapter 923 Return of Satnicum&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   One of the Roman soldiers had a low-grade fever before setting off, but he hid it and did not tell it, because in the past two days, any soldier with a fever would be removed from the original team, and then no trace would be seen. As a result, after he entered the Theonian military camp, he was highly nervous. Coupled with standing still, his body was consumed rapidly. He suddenly began to vomit, and then fainted to the ground. Seeing this, other Roman soldiers seemed to have seen a ghost. , fleeing in panic. Although Aulus, Mejius and others took some measures in the city to slow down the spread of the plague, prohibiting soldiers from spreading rumors and preventing chaos, the soldiers who fell in the past two days There are many, and the soldiers have heard about it to some extent.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The unusual behavior of the Roman soldiers immediately attracted the attention of the Theonia officer. Besides, Theonia was also obliged to treat the Roman soldiers who fainted on the ground, so they called the doctor.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The doctor who was called was none other than Critos, who had been praised by Davos at the Magna Graecia Medical Forum for being good at research. In the past two years, he had been following Hippocrates, who had stayed in Tulii and specialized in medicine. After studying, you must know that Hippocrates has a very in-depth study of plague, and Critos naturally has a deep accumulation of medical knowledge in this area, just because there has been no plague in the Kingdom of Theonia so far, So he hasn't had a chance to put theory into practice.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After carefully checking the physical condition of the fallen soldier and the vomit, Critos became suspicious. Excited, he immediately called Stacey Kordas for confirmation. The two exchanged opinions at the scene, and finally Decided to report to Daves immediately.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ctesus, who was at the scene, was shocked when he learned about the situation. He wanted to immediately arrest these Roman soldiers for interrogation, but considering that doing so would cause a serious diplomatic incident, he was cautious and ordered them to arrest them immediately. The Roman soldiers were isolated and rushed to the main tent with Stacey Cordas.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   As a result, Davos suddenly opened his mouth and made a bluff, which made Aulus leak the secret.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Although he subsequently denied it, Davos threatened him: If Aulus did not tell the truth, Theonia would not accept the surrender of the Satnicum garrison and let them be destroyed by the plague in the city.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aulus was forced to admit that Satnicum might have been plagued by plague.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But he then argued that this was just the beginning and the situation was not serious, so they didn't pay much attention.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos told him in a stern tone: The Kingdom of Theonia has advanced medical skills and has a lot of experience in treating plagues, but everyone in Satnicum City must fully follow the instructions of Dr. Theonia. rescued.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the end, Aulus, whose conspiracy was exposed, chose to surrender (because there were many members of the Cominenius clan among the defenders) and obediently restarted the fight with Henepolis, Tormid, and Medical Superintendent Staceko. Das discussed how to treat the defenders after the surrender.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Afterwards, Aulus returned to the city with this agreement in frustration, and discussed with Mejius and others.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   After Aulus left, Davos immediately announced that the entire Theonia camp was on alert. Let Stacey Cordas lead the doctors in the entire camp to examine the physical conditions of all the soldiers in the camp in detail, focusing on the Roman soldiers who had sneaked out of the city before and isolate them. At the same time, the engineering battalion led the soldiers to boil a large amount of quicklime and sprinkle it again around the camp; the baggage battalion had to make countless thick linen strips for the soldiers to cover their mouths and noses with and wear them all day long; all competitions and trainings were held immediately Stop, soldiers are not allowed to gather together, and try to stay in tents during the day; in addition, we must vigorously eliminate rats and repel mosquitoes in the camp...&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In fact, there are some measures that the Theonian army has been strictly following. This time it is just re-emphasized.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos also ordered that soldiers from each legion in the camp take turns to build three simple, smaller camps farther away from the camp.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos also asked the officers of each legion to tell the soldiers frankly: There is a plague in Satnicum City, and the defenders will surrender. They need not be afraid. The doctors have made careful preparations. His Majesty also prayed to Hades and received blessings.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Since the founding of Theonia, Daves has always attached great importance to the medical development of the kingdom, and he also knows that the plague is actually an acute infectious disease through the health knowledge of his previous life. As long as the environment is always kept clean, the incidence of disease can be reduced as much as possible. Sources, such as rats, mosquitoes, flies, and corpses, some suspicious places must be disinfected in time. Lime is a cheap and effective disinfection material... Therefore, in this era of frequent plagues, it is completely possible to reduce the number of disinfectants in the kingdom. The occurrence of the plague.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It was precisely because he had been insisting on teaching this knowledge to doctors in the kingdom and vigorously promoting it in the kingdom as king, coupled with the addition of Hippocrates, who had rich experience in treating plagues in the past few years, that Dai Dai There has never been a plague in the Kingdom of Onia. Even during the drought last year, due to the attention paid by the entire kingdom, the people escaped the custom of "a major disaster must be followed by a major epidemic".&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Therefore, at this time, the vast majority of the soldiers in the camp had only heard about the horror of the plague, but had not experienced it personally. In addition, with the personal guarantee of King Davos, the descendant of Hades, they did not feel panic. The order in the entire camp is quite stable.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   One day later, the Satnicum garrison formally surrendered to Theonia, and the Roman dictator Camillus also died of illness after announcing his surrender.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The news of his death soon spread throughout the city, and all the Roman soldiers and the residents of Satnicum fell into grief.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When opening the city, the body of Camillus was placed on the carriage and was carried out first, followed closely by the Roman soldiers. Their faces were sad and nervous, and they were not wearing armor or carrying weapons. All in plain clothes.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Theonian soldiers were all in uniform, holding shield guns, covering their mouths and noses with linen cloth, and lined up in two dense columns with their heads held high, extending from the city gate to the newly built camp, with a spacious thoroughfare in the middle.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Roman soldiers were walking along this road and were stopped near the end.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos led the generals to the carriage.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked at the haggard body of Camillus lying in the carriage. He solemnly bowed three times to the father of Rome in his previous life. The generals and ministers behind him naturally followed suit.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The Roman soldiers who were a little uneasy saw this scene. Although they did not understand the meaning of this action, they could also deeply feel the respect that the king and ministers of Theonia had for Camillus, so they became quiet one after another.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, Davos, who was also covered in linen, turned to face the Theonian generals and officials, pulled down his mask, and said loudly: "Camillus, a Roman citizen, has been participating in the Roman Congress since he came of age. He fought wars with surrounding city-states and repeatedly made military exploits in the battles. More than 20 years ago, the Romans grew in strength and began to attack their most important enemy, Viai. When other Roman generals were helpless to capture the city of Viai, The Roman Senate appointed Camillus as the commander-in-chief. After careful planning, he finally captured Viai, a city not smaller than Rome.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   However, his achievements aroused the jealousy of some Roman citizens, so someone accused him of corruption and blasphemy against the gods at the citizens' assembly. As a result, the people who did not know the truth actually passed the proposal. According to Roman law, he was found guilty and he would Although Camillus was angry at being expelled, he accepted the punishment, left Rome, and settled in a nearby Latin city-state.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   More than ten years ago, the Celts invaded the south and occupied Rome. Camillus was worried about his motherland and called on the people in Latium to resist the Celtic invasion. In the battle with the Celts, he gradually organized a large army and finally defeated the Celts.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When the Romans were grateful to Camillus for his recovery of Rome and gave him great glory, he was thinking about how the Romans could defeat the powerful Celts in future battles. So instead of sitting back and enjoying the credit, he chose On an arduous road, he had to reform hundreds of years of military tradition and create a new military system to make the Roman army stronger and more combat-effective.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the end, he succeeded. The Roman army trained by the reformed Roman military system repeatedly won victories in wars with surrounding forces. Every time Rome encountered difficulties and dangers, the first thing people thought of was Camillus, and Camillus Regardless of his old age, Milus repeatedly responded to the Senate's call and led the Roman citizens in conquests here and there. He was invincible, making Rome the overlord of central Italy and a nightmare for other races in just 10 years after its recovery. . if--"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Davos looked at the bright red Roman flag on the carriage and said with emotion: "If there was no Kingdom of Theonia on the land of Italy, perhaps Rome, a Latin city-state fed by the Tiber River, would be in Camillus. Armed with the new military system established, he will continue to be strong, and even become the overlord of Italy and the overlord of the Western Mediterranean..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Amintas, Matonis, Lizaru and other generals behind Davos were slightly dissatisfied when they heard this, but in this situation, how could they dare to interrupt rashly.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Aulus, who was behind the carriage, was stunned when he heard this. He did not expect King Theonia to be so optimistic about Rome, and he suddenly seemed to understand in his heart: Why did King Theonia dare to ignore Carthage? Attack, personally lead the army to attack Rome, which has no direct conflict of interest with the Kingdom of Theonia.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   But will Rome really have as good a future as he says? Aulus was leisurely and fascinated, but when he recalled the current situation, he couldn't help but sigh heavily.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
