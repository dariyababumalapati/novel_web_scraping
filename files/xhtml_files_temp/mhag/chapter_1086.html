   Chapter 1086 A New Job&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Maximus!...Maximus!..." A shout came from behind.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus turned around blankly, but the person calling him was Gorgeon.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus was surprised. Although he had been in and out of street taverns frequently in the past ten days or so, so he got to know the well-informed Gorgion, but he didn't think he knew him well enough to let him chase him out alone and care about him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   With vigilance, Maximus asked calmly: "Is something wrong?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Gorgeon walked up to him and said seriously: "I want to talk to you about your job search."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus He is not one of those penniless refugees who came across the ocean to Theonia to seek a better life in his hometown. He was once a Roman noble. He not only had many years of experience in government affairs, but also participated in many wars. If not Because Rome was conquered, it didn't take long for him to securely enter the Roman Senate. He also had relatively rich political experience. Every time he saw Gorgias enter the tavern, he always felt that this man was guiding him intentionally or unintentionally. Spreading certain news while the diners were arguing... This approach reminded him of some of the tricks used by the Roman senators to fool the people. Therefore, he thought that Gorgion was not simple, and he did not have much contact with him.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   At this time, Gorgeon's proactive contact aroused his alertness, and he immediately refused: "I'm sorry, I have to go home quickly, I don't have time."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Gorgeon raised his eyebrows, and a trace of displeasure flashed in his eyes. , then regained his composure, and said calmly: "Five days ago, you were attacked by a Roman on the way to the Demo Government Affairs Office in the Western Outer City. If the patrol team hadn't arrived in time, that man would have been killed. The gangsters arrested you, I'm afraid you are still lying in the hospital receiving treatment."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   For fear of worrying his family, Maximus didn't say anything to anyone, but to his surprise, Gordion said it, and his face immediately changed: " How do you know?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Gorgeon smiled coldly: "Do you think the patrol team appeared there by chance? I'm afraid you don't know yet. Just yesterday, your youngest son was playing by the pool in the middle of the building you rented. , if it hadn't been stopped by some people, I'm afraid he would have been kidnapped by a Roman... Do you have time to talk to me now?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus's face changed drastically. He did not expect those Romans who hated his "rebellion" Having already targeted his family, he almost wanted to rush to his family immediately, but he suppressed this impulse, looked directly at the person in front of him, and asked in a deep voice: "Who are you? ?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Gorgias restrained his face with a slightly sarcastic smile, and his whole temperament suddenly changed. He said solemnly: "Let me introduce you again, my name is Gorgias. Intelligence department work!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   The intelligence department of the Kingdom of Theonia?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   ...Hearing this term, Maximus instinctively felt a kind of fear, which was the result of being interrogated by them all night long in the slave camp. He subconsciously took a step back and whispered: "You... want What are you talking about?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Gorgias glanced at his retreating foot, as if he could see through his mind, looked at him sharply, and said softly: "You should know very well that your report has attracted some Romans. People are resentful of you, and you and your family have become the targets of their revenge. The reason why you are safe and sound until now is because of the secret protection of our intelligence department, but this protection does not last indefinitely!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Ma Sims stared at him, but his eyes showed a bit of weakness. He heard the threat in Gordion's words, but Gordion's words also hit what he was most worried about.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Gorgeon moved to another topic as if nothing had happened: "Master Tratus, the general manager of the Thurii region of the intelligence department, once wanted you to join us, but you refused. You must have thought that you had just gained freedom at that time. There is a better way to go, but what now?&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maybe you have the patience to work hard in the kingdom for more than 10 years to obtain the qualifications of a formal citizen? Or you can settle in the southern part of Iberia, but that place It's not yet stable. When the indigenous people attack, can you escape safely with your wife and children? Or do you finally decide to leave the kingdom and live in other strange places?..." Every&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   sentence of Gorgion The words were impacting Maximus's psychological defense, causing his eyes to flicker, and he squeezed out a sentence after a while: "...What exactly do you want to say?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Join us!" Gorgeon spoke at a low volume. Big, but loud.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   In the past, Rome did not have an intelligence department, but many nobles had a group of patrons who were responsible for snooping on privacy, inciting people, using destructive methods to seize people's land... and so on, doing some dirty things, so Maximus He believes that the intelligence department of the Kingdom of Theonia also does this kind of despicable business. Of course he disdains it because of his noble birth, but now he seems to be in a desperate situation.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus's face was uncertain. He hesitated and struggled for a while, and then tentatively said: "...What are the benefits of joining you? Can I become an official citizen as soon as possible?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Gorgeon said seriously: "Even if I join you, what are the benefits?" Our intelligence department directly serves His Majesty Davos, but if you want to directly become a formal citizen, it is impossible due to the constraints of "Theonian Laws", but we have more opportunities to make meritorious deeds, which can make you more Become an official citizen quickly&#226;&#128;&#148;"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "I remember that you don't seem to be an official citizen yet." Maximus said with a hint of ridicule.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Gorgeon smiled slightly: "Actually, I have been for a long time. Because of official duties, I deliberately let the diners in the tavern think so." "&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   So, you are from Epirus and you came here only 5 years ago. To Theonia...is this information also false?"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "These are all true, but not long after I came to Theonia, I joined the intelligence department and was ordered to go to Brindisi in Pucciti. The naval base performed tasks, and during the invasion of the former Apulian region of Epirus and the Peloponnese, it won their trust and acted as a guide, but in fact secretly kept their every march route secret. I told the Ninth Legion, which eventually led to their destruction. I made great contributions to this. Two years later, I became an official citizen and was transferred back to Thurii to serve..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Gorgeon said quite proudly: " Although our intelligence department seems inconspicuous, it is actually very important. Once something important happens, not to mention the city chief executive, even the wartime governor and military commanders have to take the initiative to ask for help from the intelligence directors in our various regions. , their military exploits and political achievements are all due to us. As His Majesty Davos said, we are the heroes of the kingdom hidden in the dark, guarding the safety of the kingdom conscientiously!..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Seeing that Maximus was deep in thought, Gorgeon struck while the iron was hot and continued: "What's more, you have joined the intelligence service. Although you are not a citizen yet, you have become one of us. Your family will receive our full support. Protection. Your life will also be greatly improved, because you may perform tasks in another capacity and receive double pay..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Maximus listened, so he had difficulty making a decision for a while. He hesitated. He said: "Let me go back and think about it..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Gorgeon saw that he was a little moved, and then said: "You'd better make a decision as soon as possible, because it is important to arrest the person who conspired to assassinate His Majesty King Davos. The suspect incident is almost over, and our protection of your family is almost over."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   When Maximus heard this, he suddenly became anxious and blurted out: "I...I...I decided to join you."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Gorgeon revealed his face Victorious smile: "This is a wise choice! Report to the white courtyard next to the Western Outer City Patrol Station tomorrow morning!"&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   &#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#226;&#128;&#166;&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Also on this night , one of the five rotating presidents of the Senate and the just-retired Administrator Lysias of Thurii, the residence welcomed a distinguished guest - Administrator Milon of Catanai (Milon was transferred after Sipulos) The administrator of Katanay who took over after Thurii had just expired and came back to report on his duties).&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Back then, Lysias and Milon were political rivals in Crotone. They fought fiercely for their own interests. Later, Lysias won and Milon was expelled from Crotone by the citizens' assembly. At that time he hated Lysias very much in his heart.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   It was not until Dionysius led the army of Syracuse to invade Magna Graecia that Myron was recalled to Crotone.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   For the survival of the city-state, the two temporarily buried the hatchet and worked together until Crotone was merged into the Kingdom of Theonia. There was no conflict of interest between the two. Instead, they were both born in Crotone. The sub-seniors needed more support from each other in the unfamiliar political arena of Theonia, so the hostile relationship between the two finally improved. And after more than 10 years of contact, the two Crotones, who had different personalities and were once enemies, People eventually become friends.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "Myron, you came tonight, aren't you worried about your work report tomorrow?" Lysias asked with a smile.&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   "There is nothing to worry about about the report. Katanai has developed more prosperously in recent years. The elders will know that I have a lot of credit for this!" Milon was quite confident and said straightforwardly: "Okay. Come on, stop pretending, you know why I came here to see you tonight! District Chief Executive! I want to become the Chief Executive of the East and West Xili Region, and I need your support!" "The&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Chief Executive of the East and West Xili Region..." Lysias was not surprised. He touched his chin and said thoughtfully: "It does not belong to the chief executives of those regions that His Majesty needs to personally designate (Davos proposed in today's Senate meeting, ' Since the southern region of Iberia, the Roman region, and the western region of Sicily are located on the borders of the kingdom, the situation they face is relatively complicated. For the security and stability of the kingdom, he must personally determine the candidates for the regional chief executives, and the chief executives of other regions. All the candidates were freely selected by the senators, and he did not interfere in any way.' In fact, Davos used the right to select the regional chief executive in exchange for the passage of the other three resolutions. Sure enough, everything went as he imagined), and you have since Since you became the administrator of Naxos, you have many years of experience as an administrator, and your political performance is also good, especially in the last war. Moreover, you are already very familiar with the situation in eastern Sicily. It stands to reason that, If you want to be elected as the chief executive of Dongxixili District, it shouldn't be a big problem..."&#13;
  </font>&#13;
 </font>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">&#13;
   Thanks to Xixu for the reward!&#13;
