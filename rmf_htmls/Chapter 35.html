     Chapter 35 – The Need for a Guard Unit
    </h1>
   </div>
   <p>
    “It is precisely because these newly joined slaves are familiar with military affairs that they should not be treated as ordinary soldiers,” Maximus said confidently. “They can cook, which the kitchen of the logistics team needs; they can transport supplies, which the logistics team’s convoy requires; they can take care of the wounded, which the medical camp the logistics team is about to establish needs; and they can also maintain and repair weapons, which our troops urgently need…”
   </p>
   <p>
    “They also understand military training and how to construct a camp… We need them even more to teach our ignorant recruits!” Crixus reminded, unwilling to back down.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It seems that this batch of new recruits is highly sought after,” Spartacus said seriously, looking at the two of them. “Each major team needs them to improve combat effectiveness, and the logistics team also needs them to provide better support for us. I suggest allocating thirty people to the logistics team for now, and when more people join, we can give the logistics team more personnel. What do you think?”
   </p>
   <p>
    No one opposed this, but Maximus looked somewhat aggrieved. “Over 200 people, and we’re only getting 30 for the supply team. That’s too few! Well, for the sake of our entire team, I accept.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He paused for a moment and then continued with a serious expression, “I have another suggestion. I hope the logistics team can have its own guard unit!”
   </p>
   <p>
    In response, Crixus immediately objected, “Absolutely not! The logistics team is not responsible for combat, and your safety is protected by us. It is completely unnecessary to assign a guard unit to you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “We used to think the same way. With your protection, we didn’t have to worry about our safety,” Maximus said with a regretful tone. “But precisely because of that, when you were fighting at the foot of the mountain, our logistics team was busy extinguishing fires in the camp. The result: you lost the battle, discarded your weapons and armor, and fled for your lives, only thinking of saving yourselves. But did anyone think about stopping the pursuers for our logistics team?
   </p>
   <p>
    “While we were in panic, we were still thinking of rushing the wagon up the mountain, so that when you defend the mountain in the future, you wouldn’t starve. As a result, we wasted time. Our logistics team consists of either elderly, women, or children. How could they possibly outrun you? In the end, over thirty people were caught up by enemy soldiers and died in that mass grave…”
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximus sniffed, his expression filled with sorrow.
   </p>
   <p>
    Crixus was at a loss for words, unsure of how to refute.
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximus emphasized his words and continued, “We worked hard to bring the wagons up the mountain. Because the mountain road was narrow, we stopped halfway up, hoping that you would send troops to guard them and prevent them from being looted by the enemy. But what did you say? ‘No, our brothers just escaped from the pursuers, where do we have the energy to guard your wagons?’…”
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximus sneered and said angrily, “Now that we have won the battle, everyone is celebrating our victory, but don’t forget that it was our logistics team who came up with the idea of descending from the cliff when you were in despair! It was our logistics team that worked hard to make the long rope that allowed you to descend safely! And it was our logistics team that made enough food for you to have the strength to fight the enemy! For the logistics team that played an important role in this war, I believe it is only right for it to have its own guard unit to protect itself!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Crixus’ face turned pale, and Oenomaus and Artorix looked ashamed… The living room fell into silence for a moment.
   </p>
   <p>
    Spartacus looked around at everyone and sincerely said, “The logistics team is indeed important to us, and it has made great contributions in the battle against the Romans. We must fight with all our might, and sometimes we truly have no spare energy to take care of the logistics team. That was my mistake! Now it seems that the logistics team does need a dedicated guard unit to ensure its safety. Let’s allocate 100 personnel to this guard unit for now, and when the logistics team expands, we can increase the number of personnel in the guard unit. What do you think?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I agree!” Maximus immediately responded loudly. Although he was a bit disappointed with the small number of personnel in the guard unit, having the logistics team armed would make certain things easier to handle.
   </p>
   <p>
    After Maximus made his statement, Crixus, Oenomaus, and Artorix felt too embarrassed to object, and the matter was settled.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I hope this guard unit of a hundred soldiers will be commanded by Phaselus,” Maximus looked at Spartacus and made a further request, as Phaselus currently served under Spartacus as the captain of the first squad.
   </p>
   <p>
    Spartacus believed that Maximus made this request because he had a good relationship with Phaselus, and yesterday on the plateau, only Phaselus responded to Maximus’ request to help him guard the wagons. Therefore, appointing Phaselus as the leader of the guard unit should ensure that he would follow Maximus’ orders. Spartacus was pleased with this and readily agreed.
   </p>
   <p>
    After the meeting ended, Maximus caught up with Hamilcar and whispered, “Teacher, thanks for your help earlier!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Hamilcar turned to look at him and said with concern, “Now that the logistics team has added a guard unit and needs to take care of the wounded, there will be more tasks and more people to manage than before. Can you handle it alone? And be careful to not let any problems arise, giving other people an opportunity to use it against you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximus understood who Hamilcar was referring to and immediately reassured him, “Teacher, rest assured, I will do my best to manage the logistics team and provide better assistance to our entire team!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Hamilcar nodded. “Let’s go. Come with me now to select those 30 new recruits.”
   </p>
   <p>
    More than 200 Roman legion slaves had just joined the rebel army and had not yet been assigned to different teams. For the time being, they were under the jurisdiction of Hamilcar, who had recently taken charge of military affairs. The majority of them were young men in their 20s and 30s, with only a few middle-aged and elderly individuals over the age of 40. They were all in good health, with a healthy complexion.
   </p>
   <p>
    As public slaves of Rome, it was evident that they were treated fairly well within the Roman army. However, compared to other slaves who joined the rebel army, many of them seemed overly cautious. When Hamilcar gathered them together, most of them kept their heads down, appearing lethargic.
   </p>
   <p>
    Observing this, Maximus spoke loudly, “I am going to select 30 people from among you to join the logistics team. Those who join the logistics team will not have to fight the Romans directly and can enjoy good food. You’ll even get to spend time with women every day. Who among you is willing to go?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Upon hearing this, the slaves became spirited and eagerly shouted, “Me! Me! I am willing to go!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Though a few remained silent, they all raised their heads.
   </p>
   <p>
    Frowning, Maximus said, “We only need 30 people for the logistics team, and there are too many of you who want to join. So, I have to carefully choose among you… Who among you is skilled in carpentry? It would be best if you can construct siege weapons.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Me! Me!” Over 20 slaves simultaneously exclaimed.
   </p>
   <p>
    “So many of you?!” Maximus exclaimed in surprise, pointing to his right side and saying, “Then all of you come over here.”
   </p>
   <p>
    After these slaves stepped forward, Maximus stared at them with a fierce gaze and said, “Later, I will test your carpentry skills. If anyone is lying and I find out, the next time we fight the Romans, they will be placed at the forefront of the battle formation!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Hamilcar hesitated because he noticed that many of the slaves who stepped forward looked uneasy.
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximus took the opportunity to say, “Now, I will give you another chance to change your choice. If you feel that your carpentry skills are not sufficient, you can return your teams.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Immediately, more than half of the slaves lowered their heads and hurriedly stepped back.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Among you, who knows the most about constructing camps? It would be even better if you know how to build roads.” Maximus continued, then looked at the slaves standing on his right side. “If any of you feel that you are proficient in this area, you can also step forward. The more you know, the more likely I will choose you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Having learned from the previous lesson, this time over a dozen people spoke up, and some of those who had previously stepped back responded as well.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Among you, who knows more about maintaining and repairing weapons and armor? It would be best if you are also skilled in using the Scorpio

    …. Who among you understands military training and tactics? Perhaps even someone with extensive battlefield experience…. Who among you has experience in caring for wounded soldiers? It would be even better if you are knowledgeable in treating external injuries…”
