     Chapter 43 – Camp Relocation

   <p>
    “You, on the other hand, try to control everything. Even if you stand in the kitchen watching over them every day, shouting and yelling, their efficiency won’t improve much. You should be good at delegating tasks to your subordinates and motivating them to work.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Seeing her still confused, Maximus patiently explained, “Let’s take the example of cooking porridge, soup, and meat in the kitchen. You can divide the people who are good at these tasks into two or three groups, appoint a leader for each group, and assign them tasks. The group that performs the best and completes the tasks the fastest should be rewarded. For example, they can have half a day of extra rest, be given an extra piece of meat, or you can gather your subordinates regularly and publicly praise the best-performing group…”
   </p>
   <p>
    Despite Maximus’ confident explanation, in his previous life, he chose to become a freelancer because he disliked trouble and didn’t want to manage people. But in this chaotic world, he had to change his habits and learn how to work and manage people in order to ensure his own safety.
   </p>
   <p>
    Agnes listened attentively, feeling excited. She said, “Captain, these methods you mentioned are all excellent! I… I will give them a try, but I’m not very clever, so I may not be able to do it well!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No one is born knowing how to do everything. As long as you do your work seriously and make an effort, you will eventually succeed. Don’t worry!” Maximus encouraged her with empathy, because this was his experience during this time.
   </p>
   <p>
    Agnes gained confidence from his words and immediately expressed her intention to implement these methods in the kitchen starting tomorrow.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh, and one more thing. When I saw you using the millstone to shell and grind the wheat, why didn’t you use donkeys to pull the millstone continuously? Instead, you often had people pushing it, which not only wasted manpower but also reduced efficiency,” Maximus pointed out.
   </p>
   <p>
    “If we let the donkeys pull the millstone all the time, they would get exhausted. Besides, we have many people, so we take turns pushing the millstone. It’s not a big deal,” Agnes explained.
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     Indeed, diligence and frugality are deeply ingrained in the hearts of these hardworking people…
    </em>
    Maximus smiled helplessly and said loudly, “Agnes, you must understand that now people are important, not donkeys! I will request Spartacus to help us acquire more donkeys so that they can do the work, and we only need one person to oversee them.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well… alright,” Agnes reluctantly agreed.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t you feel that you have enough manpower available now? Can you allocate a group of young women to go to the medical unit, as I mentioned earlier?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Agnes thought for a moment, then said through gritted teeth: “I suppose it’s possible.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Who do you think is suitable to lead the group among those you’re going to send?” Maximus asked without hesitation.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Nessia,” Agnes answered promptly, referring to a young and beautiful woman who was very familiar with kitchen affairs.
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximus nodded approvingly, imagining the image of the young and charming woman in his mind. He said, “It’s already late. You should go back and rest. Tomorrow, there will be a lot of work to do. After you go out, call the children in. They’re probably about to fall asleep.”
   </p>
   <p>
    After Agnes left, Maximus looked up at the dark night outside the window and stretched lazily. “I’ve accomplished quite a lot tonight. Tomorrow will be a new beginning!”
   </p>
   <p>
    ………………………………………………
   </p>
   <p>
    The next morning, after breakfast, the entire rebel army began to move camp to the farm below the mountain.
   </p>
   <p>
    Although the distance between the two locations was short, the soldiers in each team appeared somewhat disorganized due to a lack of effective organization.
   </p>
   <p>
    The logistics team had made prior arrangements, but they had to carry too many things, so their progress was relatively slow. As the leader, Maximus didn’t just sit back and relax. He personally took the lead in helping to carry and transport things and injured soldiers, and naturally, the others did not dare to be idle. The enthusiasm of the whole team was high, and by noon, the logistics team had settled into the farm.
   </p>
   <p>
    Following that, Frontinus set up military tents outside the farm gate with the 34 legion slaves, and Maximus led others to help.
   </p>
   <p>
    Within two hours, all the medical team’s tents were set up.
   </p>
   <p>
    Instead of immediately carrying the wounded soldiers inside, Maximus gathered the members of the medical team first.
   </p>
   <p>
    The newly formed medical team consisted of the newly appointed leader, Putrius Horatius, and five men who were also former Roman legion slaves. Agnes had sent 32 women from the kitchen, making a total of 38 people. The men and women gathered separately, very distinct from each other.
   </p>
   <p>
    Seeing this situation, Maximus playfully reminded, “Brothers and sisters, from now on, you have to work together. Don’t stand so far apart. Everyone, come closer.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Except for Horatius, these legion slaves were relatively young and had been eyeing these women for a while. However, considering that they were newcomers, they didn’t dare to make any moves. Now, upon hearing Maximus’ words, they immediately smiled and moved closer.
   </p>
   <p>
    On the other hand, these women from the kitchen had often been harassed by the rebel soldiers in the past month, so they were cautious and guarded. However, since Maximus had spoken, they reluctantly made a move, which showed Maximus’ prestige among the logistics team.
   </p>
   <p>
    Observing the situation, Maximus said with a serious expression, “Let me emphasize one thing: if both parties in our logistics team willingly engage in intimate relationships, I won’t say anything. However, if a woman disagrees and a man insists forcefully, the punishment can range from a beating to a fatal stab. So, before you make such a mistake, think carefully!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximus was tall and robust, and now that he was leading a team, his stern expression carried a certain authority, causing these male slaves to feel a chill in their hearts. On the other hand, the women showed smiles, realizing that their leader was truly on their side.
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximus then turned his gaze to Horatius. This Roman veteran had a plain appearance and looked somewhat older than Frontinus, despite being younger: “Horatius, you are now the leader of our medical team——”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Captain Maximus!” Horatius hastily interjected, “Don’t listen to what Frontinus said. I don’t know how to treat illnesses; I can only bandage wounds and take care of the injured. I’m willing to work in the medical team, but the position as the leader should be given to someone skilled in medicine.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximus was satisfied with Horatius’ frank words and shook his head, saying, “My requirements for the leader of the medical team are, first and foremost, genuine concern for the wounded and having the patients’ well-being in mind. Secondly, the ability to manage the team and command them to better take care of the patients, and handle any unexpected situations the medical team may encounter during the war. As for medical skills, whether good or not is irrelevant to being able to lead the team.”
   </p>
   <p>
    After listening, Horatius thought carefully and said, “Then I can give it a try.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I have a few requirements for the medical team,” Maximus went straight to the point, looking at him. “First, separate the seriously wounded and those who cannot walk from the ordinary wounded and prioritize their care. Second, your medical team’s camp must maintain cleanliness, with no garbage or excrement accumulation, and minimize the presence of mosquitoes and rats inside the tents. Third, use boiled water to clean wounds, and the bandages used for dressing wounds must be soaked in boiling water and dried before use. Fourth, the task of cleaning wounds and taking care of the injured will mainly be assigned to the women.”
   </p>
   <p>
    After Maximus finished speaking, the women didn’t seem to mind much since most of them didn’t have experience in caring for the wounded. However, a few male slaves began to discuss among themselves, “We’ve taken care of injured comrades before, but we’ve never had so many troublesome tasks.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yeah, taking care of the wounded shouldn’t involve cleaning the tents and boiling water to soak bandages… I’ve never heard of it!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “If you want to slack off and don’t want to work hard, then leave the medical team right away. Don’t make a fuss here!” a woman stood up and scolded loudly.
   </p>
   <p>
    She was a 20-year-old girl with soft black long hair, slightly dark skin, captivating brown eyes, a small and straight nose, slightly thick lips, and a graceful figure.
   </p>
   <p>
    Seeing that the woman scolding them was beautiful, the male slaves immediately retorted unwilling to show weakness: “Who are you? Do you even know how to take care of wounded soldiers?”
