     Chapter 17 – Leader of the Logistics Team
    </h1>

   <p>
    “Me!” two young slave boys immediately shouted excitedly at the same time.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You two have answered the most questions in the past. Today, let others have this opportunity,” Maximus said as he looked around.
   </p>
   <p>
    “There are quite a few people who want to answer the questions!” Spartacus, who was peering at everything from outside the courtyard gate, whispered in surprise.
   </p>
   <p>
    “That’s because Maximus set a rule. As long as they study seriously and can correctly answer the questions he asks, they can have an extra piece of meat or an additional cup of wine for dinner on the next day. So these guys are more focused when learning what Maximus teaches,” Hamilcar explained quietly on the side.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Your Logistics Team must not take advantage of the convenience to feed yourselves extra meals,” Spartacus reminded with a serious tone.
   </p>
   <p>
    “We have no other choice,” Hamilcar immediately complained. “Now that we are acquiring more and more supplies, the people you assigned to us can handle physical work, but most of them are illiterate and don’t understand arithmetic. Maximus and I have to check the supplies until late at night. Maximus said to me, ‘Our group is still small, but we’re already so busy. If the number of people exceeds 10,000 in the future, won’t we be worked to death…’ So he suggested using the spare time every evening to teach everyone arithmetic and literacy. Once they all learn, we won’t be so overwhelmed.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Hamilcar continued, “I agreed with his opinion, but the actual implementation is not that easy. Many people are unwilling to use their brains to study. That’s why Maximus came up with the method of using food as a stimulus. He also added storytelling and even came up with such simple symbols to represent numbers. That’s why our brothers are so actively gathering in the courtyard after dinner, lighting bonfires, and earnestly studying. Look, they even attracted people from other teams…”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why do you let the newly joined brothers speak publicly about their experiences?” Spartacus curiously asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You know, these slaves who join our team come from all directions—Asia Minor, Northern Greece, Iberia, Greece, Egypt, Numidia, Gaul, Germania, Italy, Illyria…” Hamilcar counted on his fingers, listing them one by one. “Their customs and habits are different, their personalities are different, and their languages are different. When they gather together, conflicts are inevitable. It’s easier here since we have fewer people, but I’ve heard that fights often break out in other teams. I imagine you and Crixus must be troubled by this, right?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Spartacus nodded, signaling Hamilcar to continue.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Maximus found a solution to this problem! He told me: ‘Although our brothers come from different backgrounds, they all share the common experience of being oppressed by the rich and patricians, as lowly slaves under Roman oppression. They all have tragic experiences. If we let them publicly share their past experiences, it will easily evoke resonance among everyone and promote mutual acceptance, making them close comrades in the fight against a common enemy…’ I followed his advice and let him implement this method. So far, the results have been excellent. You can see that our Logistics Team is the most united team, and so far, there have been no fights or brawls.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “…This method seems good and can be implemented in other teams. After you take over the military affairs, you can be in charge of this,” Spartacus pondered and said, “As for the candidate to replace you and become the leader of the Logistics Team…”
   </p>
   <p>
    Hamilcar said anxiously, “Spartacus, I’ve brought you here to observe for so long. Why are you still not confident? Although Maximus is young, he has the ability and insight. Moreover, he is eager to learn. After following me for so many days, he not only learned how to manage the Logistics Team and satisfy the team’s needs but also made many improvements. I can handle the military affairs for you these days because Maximus has taken sole responsibility for this team. Let me tell you the truth, Maximus’ prestige in the Logistics Team is higher than mine now. Everyone is willing to listen to him. If you let someone else take over as the leader of the Logistics Team, it might cause trouble!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Listening to Hamilcar’s reminder, Spartacus looked towards the center of the courtyard. Maximus was writing and drawing on a wooden board with limestone while explaining loudly. The eyes of the slaves around him were focused on him, listening attentively.
   </p>
   <p>
    Seeing Spartacus remaining silent, Hamilcar couldn’t help but continue, “Spartacus, is it because you still don’t trust Maximus due to the incident where he was forced to betray?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Spartacus shook his head first, then nodded, “Maximus’ recent performance is enough to earn the trust of every one of us! However… his act of betrayal has left Crixus resentful, and some of our gladiator brothers have objections, including Oenomaus.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “So what? As long as you and I support him in the meeting, Artorix will also support him. Even if Crixus and Oenomaus oppose, the minority must obey the majority, and Maximus will become the new leader of the Logistics Team.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Spartacus was about to speak when he heard orderly shouts from the courtyard, “Maximus, tell a story! Tell a story! Tell a story!!!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Alright! Alright!” Maximus smiled and pressed his hands down, gesturing for everyone to quiet down. The shouting immediately subsided. “You have all studied diligently tonight, so shall I continue telling the story of Troy?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes!!!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Spartacus looked at the lively scene in the courtyard and finally made up his mind. He said to Hamilcar, “Alright, let’s go with your suggestion. Let’s discuss it tomorrow and let Maximus take over as the leader of the Logistics Team, while you will come to manage the military affairs. Although we have more people now, most of them lack training. You need to quickly focus on military training. Otherwise, we might have trouble when fighting against the Roman legions!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Okay, I will take care of it as soon as possible,” Hamilcar responded solemnly, understanding the urgency of the matter.
   </p>
   <p>
    ………………………………………………
   </p>
   <p>
    “Please come in, Maximus. We are all waiting for you.” After hearing Spartacus’ words, Maximus entered the room.
   </p>
   <p>
    Spartacus straightforwardly said: “We just had a discussion, and we unanimously decided to make you the leader of the Logistics Team.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Upon hearing this, Maximus felt ecstatic inside. His efforts over the past month had not been in vain after all!
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximus surveyed the room: Spartacus looked expectant, Artorix showed enthusiasm, Crixus had a cold expression, and Oenomaus’ brows were slightly furrowed…
   </p>
   <p>
    Finally, his gaze fell on Hamilcar:
    <br/>
    The gladiator who had the closest relationship with him was smiling and nodding towards him…
   </p>
   <p>
    He suppressed his excitement and put on a concerned expression as he asked, “What about Hamilcar?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “He will be in charge of managing the military affairs and assist us in organizing our growing army. Tell me, do you have the confidence to handle the Logistics Team on your own?” Spartacus looked at him and asked seriously.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Of course, no problem!” Maximus confidently replied in a loud voice. He knew he couldn’t show any weakness at this moment.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Humph, what’s the use of empty words? We’ll see if you can do it in due time,” Crixus interjected coldly.
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximus pretended not to hear the sarcastic remark.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The supply of food and other resources is crucial for us. Therefore, in the future, when we discuss matters concerning our entire army, you will also participate and provide us with information about the reserves. Of course, you can also give us suggestions, and we will discuss them together, understood?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Understood!” Maximus could no longer suppress his joy and smiled:
    <em>
     Now, I have finally become one of the leaders of this uprising! Even though I have the fewest number of people under my command, I’m still one of the six key figures of this rebel army!
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    During this time, under the proposals of Spartacus and Hamilcar, a Military Commanders Assembly was established to manage the growing team and handle various complicated matters. The military commanders in charge of the meeting were Spartacus, Crixus, Hamilcar, Oenomaus, and Artorix, the five gladiators who had initially led the revolt. Additionally, when encountering important matters that concerned the entire army’s life and death, a soldiers’ assembly had to be held to make decisions.
