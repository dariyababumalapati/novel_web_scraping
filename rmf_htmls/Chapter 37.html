     Chapter 37 – Roman Veterans
    </h1>
   </div>
   <p>
    The celebratory feast for the victory was successfully held at dusk. The setback faced by the rebels also had its advantages. The soldiers, numbering less than 2,000, were able to gather in a camp next to the farm. Dozens of people sat around a bonfire with a roasted lamb on top (after the Roman army defeated the rebels and entered the camp, they captured all the cattle and sheep that the logistics team had been herding, originally intended as food reserves, but unexpectedly, with the surprise attack of the rebel army that night, these livestock fell back into the hands of the logistics team.). Each person held a small jar of diluted wine in their hands, with freshly baked bread beneath them, and steaming chicken soup…
   </p>
   <p>
    Everyone drank wine, ate meat, lamented their miserable state during yesterday’s retreat, and boasted about their bravery during the surprise attack at night. Some people excitedly started singing, while others danced around the bonfire. Laughter and chatter filled the air, creating a lively and bustling atmosphere.
   </p>
   <p>
    Spartacus, Crixus, and a few other leaders walked around the camp, frequently clinking jars with the soldiers and sharing their joy. Wherever they went, there was always thunderous applause. The battle of the previous night had made the soldiers admire these leaders even more, and they hoped to achieve more victories under their command.
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximus and the logistics team were also invited, but Maximus declined, citing the presence of too many women in the logistics team and the fear that the soldiers’ revelry might lead to unexpected incidents and disrupt the festive atmosphere.
   </p>
   <p>
    Spartacus, considering the special circumstances of the logistics team, did not insist.
   </p>
   <p>
    So, the logistics team held their own feast within the farm.
   </p>
   <p>
    Over 200 people were seated around ten bonfires in the courtyard. They also drank wine, ate meat, sang, and danced, but because there were both men and women present, it wasn’t as noisy as the camp. However, the joy in their hearts was even greater.
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximus also wandered around the bonfires, toasting with his subordinates.
   </p>
   <p>
    First, he toasted to Agnes, Pigres, and Cornelius, thanking them for their unwavering support in the past two days.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then, he proceeded to toast with the others from the logistics team, expressing gratitude for their hard work over the past month.
   </p>
   <p>
    After the ups and downs of the previous day, the members of the logistics team were extremely grateful and respectful towards Maximus.
   </p>
   <p>
    They appreciated Maximus for saving their lives. Unlike Maximus, who blamed himself, they believed that it was thanks to this young leader’s early preparations and arrangements that most of them, including the elderly, women, and children, managed to escape the pursuit of the Romans and avoided the same fate as other captured soldiers.
   </p>
   <p>
    They held great admiration for Maximus’ wisdom. While the soldiers cheered for Spartacus and the other leaders for leading them to victory, they believed that it was this young man who first found a way down the mountain and even had them prepare long ropes in advance. Maximus was truly the savior of the rebel army!
   </p>
   <p>
    It is precisely because of this kind of conviction that several women boldly expressed to Maximus: “I am willing to sleep with you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximus was overwhelmed by the excessive enthusiasm of the veteran members of the logistics team, so he quickly ran over to the guard unit and toasted with the newly joined soldiers, hoping that they would become a strong support for the logistics team in the days to come.
   </p>
   <p>
    Finally, he approached the Roman slave soldiers, who were mostly gathered around a bonfire on the edge of the courtyard.
   </p>
   <p>
    “New members of the logistics team, come, let’s drink!” Maximus raised his wine jar high and shouted with a smile.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Drink!” Some people immediately responded, while others first turned to look at the slave who had taken the lead. When they saw him raising his wine jar, they followed suit.
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximus took a sip of the sweet and sour grape wine and said loudly, “Someone told me that this is Falernian wine, one of the best wines in Italy. The patrician elders of Rome often drink it. Do you think it tastes good?”
   </p>
   <p>
    The slaves were surprised and carefully took a sip. Then someone said, “It tastes good!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “We don’t have cruel and vicious nobles here, no overseers who whip you with a lash. We are all suffering people, working happily together, and even eating good food that the Roman elites used to eat. Doesn’t it feel good?” Maximus asked with a smile, then looked towards the center of the courtyard. Someone was beating a simple rhythm on a drum, and several women were singing and dancing, attracting many men to joyfully dance around them, including the newly joined slaves.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Compared to before, this place is like a paradise!” Someone excitedly replied.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, exactly!” Someone else happily agreed.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But how long can these happy days last?” Suddenly, someone in the crowd spoke up. It was the elderly that was acting as the leader of the Roman slave soldiers.
   </p>
   <p>
    Fearlessly meeting Maximus’ gaze, he calmly said, “I’m sorry for saying something that might spoil the festive atmosphere, but I used to be a Roman citizen and a soldier in the Roman legion. I have served in the army for many years, and they,” the leader pointed to the other slaves around him, “were also Roman legion soldiers.”
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     No wonder these people understand construction, carpentry, weapon maintenance, and military training… They turned out to be veteran soldiers of the Roman legion. This is a real treasure!
    </em>
    Maximus felt delighted in his heart.
   </p>
   <p>
    “We used to be Roman citizens, but we now hate Rome!” the elderly leader emphasized, and those around him nodded in agreement.
   </p>
   <p>
    “We were once soldiers under General Marius. We faithfully followed him because he protected the rights of us ordinary soldiers! But after his death, the dictator Sulla led his army to attack Rome, and the populares wanted to reorganize us retired soldiers to resist Sulla.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Many of my comrades recognized the precarious situation and refused to join. Only those of us without families to worry about thought that we absolutely could not let General Marius’s hard-won rights for us go to waste. So we responded to the call of the Senate and decided to risk it all in battle. But the result, tens of thousands of troops were defeated at the gates of Rome…” The leader spoke with a pained expression, and the people around him sighed, each wearing a look of regret.
   </p>
   <p>
    “We were captured by Sulla. He didn’t execute us like those Samnites, but he stripped us of our Roman citizenship and made us slaves, attempting to subject us to even more humiliation! These years, we have lived a life worse than death. Many of our brothers silently passed away, their bodies thrown into a pit outside the Porta Esquilina (Rome’s easternmost gate) where wild dogs gnawed on them… This time we are able to regain our freedom, we are truly grateful to you!”
   </p>
   <p>
    In fact, the leader should also thank the deceased Glaber. If not for his strong insistence on conscripting some old soldiers, both citizens and slaves, the recruiting officer wouldn’t have included these “Roman rebels” who had spent eight or nine years in slave camps. They were considered too old to be a threat, but they unexpectedly gained the opportunity for freedom.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Because we spent many years in the Roman legion, we know the strength of the Roman army. With just a small force of two or three thousand people like you, lacking weapons and equipment, even if you win one battle, once you attract Rome’s attention, you will likely face annihilation…” The elderly leader’s voice solemnly reminded them, his eyes filled with pain and sadness.
   </p>
   <p>
    The people around fell silent.
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximus, however, remained unfazed. He looked intently at the old man, whose face showed some signs of age but still carried a robust physique. The long scar on his face added a touch of fierceness. Maximus asked, “May I know your name?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Cassius Frontinus.”
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     Just by hearing the name, one can tell that this person came from the Roman plebeians. No wonder he obeyed the call of the populares…
    </em>
    Maximus continued to inquire, “Frontinus, were you not just an ordinary soldier before?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I was a centurion in the legion for a while.” Frontinus hesitated for a moment, then answered. There was no hint of pride on his face, but rather a trace of melancholy.
