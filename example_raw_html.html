   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    Early the next morning, after Marin got up and washed up, he got a piece of brown bread without soil and ate it. After filling his stomach, he went out shopping.
   </font>
  </font>
  <p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Last night, Marin thought about it for half the night, and became more determined to seek refuge with Emperor Maximilian 1st of the Shinra.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Marin was very depressed. He was playing "European Universal Universal" at home, and he finally became the Holy Roman Emperor. He was getting high, but his friend Li Liang called him for help and asked him to help fight.
    </font>
   </font>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      As for the cause of the incident, it was because Li Liang went out to practice his stall at night and had a conflict with a group of gangsters over a dispute over the stall's territory.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Then, Li Liang was beaten.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Li Liang was naturally dissatisfied, so he called a few friends to get back on his feet.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Marin is tall and agile, and he learned military grappling from a veteran when he was a child. Naturally, he was the "mythical beast" summoned by Li Liang first.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Marin had just swept the entire Holy Roman Empire in the game and became the emperor worshiped by thousands of people. At this moment, his blood was boiling, so without saying a word, he happily went there on his second-hand electric bicycle to "safeguard justice on earth."
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      After the brothers arrived, Li Liang promised to treat everyone to hot pot after dinner and give everyone a pack of good cigarettes. Then, the atmosphere became tense...
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Under the leadership of the big man Marin, the brothers found a few young yellow guys who were still setting up stalls.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Then, like a knight, Marin spread his legs and launched a horseless charge...
     </font>
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      As expected, the few yellow guys were all fighting against the five scum. They had beaten Li Liang in a group just because of the large number of people.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Under the lead charge of the Marin Horse Knight, the little yellow-haired people were quickly beaten to a pulp.
     </font>
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      But Marin was also carried away and just rushed forward without noticing the danger behind him.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Then, a sinful brick appeared in the back of Marin's head...
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Then, Knight Ma hit a brick on the back of his head and lost consciousness...
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      "Sure enough... Banzhu... Breaking martial arts... Shenya... can't stop it..." This was Marin's last thought...
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      ........
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      After a long, long time, who knows how long...
     </font>
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Marin finally woke up, but something felt wrong.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Because when he opened his eyes, he did not see the white walls and soft lights in the hospital, nor did he see the scene in his rental house... because he could clearly smell the green smell of grass...
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      "I'll beat you up! Li Liang, you bastard. My brother was injured for standing up for you, but you left him in the wild without even sending him to the hospital! Damn it, the labor and management are going to break off all relations with you!"
     </font>
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Marin cursed and tried to get up, but he suddenly realized that this relatively immature voice did not seem to be his, but it was indeed his own...
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Marin, who has read many time-travel novels, is naturally familiar with this plot:
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      "Could it...couldn't it...have you traveled through time?"
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Marin quickly stretched out his hand and scanned the parts of himself that could be seen with his eyes...
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Then, he saw a green body, a strange costume, and a pair of snow-white hands that were obviously not his...
     </font>
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Suddenly, Marin's heart tightened - could she have traveled through time and become a woman?
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Not long ago, the movie "Prince Concubine's Promotion" was so popular that he was very afraid that he would travel through time and become a woman.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      What if she becomes a woman and is pressed down by a man in the future... Marin's hair stood on end and he didn't dare to think about it anymore...
     </font>
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      With a nervous mood, he skillfully directed the "fifth girl" on the left to reach down to the lower parts...
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      After a while, Marin was greatly relieved - he was still a man, or so, he had time-traveled into a boy.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Because the hair down there hasn't even grown yet..
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      With his mind relaxed and a strong sense of hunger coming over him, Marin fainted again...
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      ..
     </font>
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      After a long time, Marin woke up from hunger...
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      At the same time, a memory merged with Marin's consciousness - obviously, it was the memory of the original owner of this body...
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      By reading the memory, Marin learned that the original owner of this body was also named Marin.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Of course, it is not the Chinese Marin, but the Western Marin.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      To be more precise, it was a young wandering knight named Marin Hoffmann in Germany at the end of the 15th century.
     </font>
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      What is a wandering knight?
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      First of all, this is a knight (mostly a trainee knight), who usually owns a war horse, a lance, and a set of knight armor.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Some knights and war horses have horse armor, which is basic equipment.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      In addition, all knights have basically received strict training since childhood. They are good at charging immediately and are familiar with close combat. Their skills are generally much stronger than ordinary people.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      In the European Middle Ages and Renaissance, knights were the lowest feudal lords in Europe.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      On it were barons, viscounts, earls, marquises, dukes, princes, kings, and emperors.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      However, not every knight is lucky enough to get a fief.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Because knights need to fight and fight for higher-level lords in order to have a chance to obtain fiefs.
     </font>
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Moreover, knights' fiefdoms are generally relatively small, only the size of one or several villages.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      For example, this little wandering knight named Marin, his family, the Hoffmann family, is a small knight family under the Mark County in the Ruhr River region.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      This family only owns a small village with little arable land, and the total arable land is only 100 eugrams (an ancient Roman unit of area, in the Middle Ages, one eugram was equivalent to 2 acres, equivalent to 12 acres).
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      In other words, the Hoffman family only has 1,200 acres of land.
     </font>
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      1,200 acres of land seems like a lot, right?
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      In the Ming Dynasty at the same time, a large family would definitely have enough food and clothing to live in peace and prosperity.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      However, thanks to the unlucky agricultural technology of medieval Europeans, agricultural output is so low that it is shocking that the 1,200 acres of land of the Hoffman family are left fallow (Europeans practice a rotational fallow farming system, and the land is generally cultivated every two years) Or leave it idle for three years and one year to restore the soil fertility. Until modern times, this tradition still exists in European and American rural areas). Not counting the 600 acres of land, the remaining 600 acres of land can only produce 100,000 pounds of rye per year (a Cologne pound, one Cologne mark = 233.85 grams, one colon pound = 2 marks = 467.7 grams).
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      On average, the rye yield per mu of land is only 166.7 pounds, equivalent to 156 city catties.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      This is still a good harvest year. If there is a famine, the yield will be even lower, and the yield per mu will drop to about 100 kilograms.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      This kind of yield per acre is so touching. No wonder thousands of people starved to death in Germany during the Middle Ages...
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      What's even more impressive is that the wheat yield per acre in this era is even more impressive. In a large estate near Hoffman Estates, the wheat yield per acre is only less than 100 kilograms...
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Damn it, as a top student in the history department, time traveler Ma Lin knows very well that since the Han Dynasty, the wheat yield per mu in China has been stable at around 200 kilograms.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      By the Ming Dynasty, rice in the south of the Yangtze River had a high yield per mu, even reaching about 500 kilograms.
     </font>
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Marin knew the crux of the problem from various time-travel novels - it was because Westerners didn't know how to use manure.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      For a long, long time, Westerners didn't know how to fertilize their fields. They just plowed the ground, sowed seeds, and poured some water.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Then, he went to do other things.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Even the serfs didn't know how to gather weeds.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      As for feces, Europeans in the Middle Ages basically defecated everywhere, leaving cities everywhere with a stink wafting everywhere.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      This also caused flies to fly around and spread diseases everywhere.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The Black Death that broke out several times in the Middle Ages was inseparable from the poor sanitary environment in Europe at that time.
     </font>
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      In the East at the same time, farmers even pushed dung carts to cities to collect dung to use as fertilizer for farmland.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      There are also children who carry baskets to collect dung and eggs.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The Chinese people's excrement was put into the fields, which created the high yield of ancient Chinese agriculture and supported the prosperity of Chinese civilization.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The feces of Europeans are all over the city, breeding a large number of flies, causing the raging of various diseases in Europe...
     </font>
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Well, Marin felt that he was thinking too much.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The reason why his predecessor in this body became a wandering knight is a German tradition.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Since primogeniture was established in Europe, other sons of nobles have suffered.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The eldest son takes everything, and the other sons can only watch as the eldest brother takes it all...
     </font>
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      If it were a noble family, the situation would be better.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      For example, although the king's other sons do not have the right to inherit, the king's family has a great business, and the other sons can be given the title of duke, earl, etc., and they can have their own territory and continue to enjoy happiness.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Dukes and earls and other great nobles have large enough territories, so they can share some meat with their other sons...
     </font>
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      The little nobles were unlucky. Their family's territory was very small, only enough for the eldest son and his family to live.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      If you give some more to your brothers, everyone will have to drink the northwest wind.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      For example, the Hoffman family's 1,200 acres of thin land, with that little output, can barely feed the eldest son's family (not only eating, but also feeding war horses, buying and repairing weapons and armor, and feeding attendants, which is very expensive).
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      It would be absolutely unaffordable to raise several younger siblings such as Marlin Hoffman.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Therefore, the knights, the smallest feudal lords in Germany, were forced to make a decision-when their sons except the eldest son came of age, they would give him a war horse, a set of armor and a lance. Go make a living for yourself.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      As for their daughters, some poor nobles even sent their daughters directly to monasteries to become nuns in order to save dowries.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Under normal circumstances, the children of these knight families who were kicked out chose to join the great nobles, such as serving as guards for the great nobles, fighting for the great feudal lords, and so on.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Of course, not every child of a knight who was kicked out of his home would have a good opportunity to find a noble employer who appreciated him.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Many knights who could not find a job had to wander around looking for temporary employment opportunities.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      As a result, a new group emerged - wandering knights.
     </font>
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      These wandering knights all grew up in knight families. They received strict martial arts training since childhood, and their skills on horseback were very good. It was not a problem for one of them to beat two or three ordinary strong men.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Some strong men can fight off a group of bandits with one person and one horse.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      In fact, these wandering knights were the earliest mercenaries.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      However, they are all individuals who seek opportunities to serve the great nobles and wealthy individuals as individuals and do not form a group.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      It was not until a few years ago that Emperor Maximilian 1st of the Holy Roman Empire witnessed the powerful combat effectiveness of the Swiss mercenary army composed of Swiss mountain people during the war to compete for the Burgundy region, that he initiated recruitment in the German regions under his rule. The thoughts of a mercenary.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      It was during this period that the famous German mercenaries began to officially appear.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      (Note: It was not until 1508 that Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian 1st was crowned by the Pope in Rome and officially became the Holy Roman Emperor. Before that, Maximilian 1st's title of emperor was actually self-proclaimed, and only the god Only the Roman Empire's own people recognized it. Without the Roman Pope's coronation, foreigners only recognized Maximilian 1st as the King of Germany. However, in 1508, Pope Julius II not only officially crowned Maximilian 1st, but also It is allowed that future emperors of the Holy Roman Empire do not need to come to Rome to be crowned, and can just find an archbishop in their own country to crown themselves.)
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      It is now 1494, an era when Emperor Maximilian 1st is recruiting troops to prepare for war.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Marlin Hoffmann's father, Flins Hoffmann, after hearing that the emperor was recruiting mercenaries (Maximilian 1st had already recruited a group in 1487),  decided to advance the plan. The second son, Marlin Hoffman, who was only 16 years old, was kicked out of the house and asked to defect to the emperor and become a mercenary of the emperor.
     </font>
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Originally, according to tradition, Marin would not be kicked out of the house until he turned 18.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      But the old Hoffman felt that the emperor was recruiting people and the opportunity was rare.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      If he achieved military exploits, he might even get a noble title and a fief.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Therefore, he decided to let Marin take refuge early.
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      However, he overestimated his second son's experience in the world of martial arts - no, not long after leaving home, the original Marlin Hoffman only had 10 gold coins for travel expenses, and was bought by a captain of the guard who claimed to know the emperor. The scammers deceived them all...
     </font>
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Then, poor Marlin Hoffman had no money for a hotel or food.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      In desperation, he had no choice but to ride a horse and go hunting in the wild.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      First, the meat of the prey can satisfy hunger, and the fur of the prey can be exchanged for some money as travel expenses.
     </font>
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      However, Marlin Hoffman is a knight, not a hunter.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Therefore, little Marin couldn't catch any prey at all.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Can you imagine a heavily armored knight, wearing heavy armor and holding a knight's lance, chasing and poking a galloping hare?
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Wearing heavy armor itself will reduce the speed and sensitivity of the horse. How can it catch up with wild animals?
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Slow-running wild animals have long been hunted down.
     </font>
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Little Marin doesn't have a crossbow, and he doesn't know how to shoot an arrow.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Therefore, he could only continue to chase animals on horseback while hungry...
     </font>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Finally, after not eating for two days, the hungry little Marlin accidentally fell off his horse while chasing a deer and fainted in the grass.
     </font>
     <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
      Then, he was time-traveled by Marin from China in later generations...
     </font>
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Although this method is more efficient to make, it will damage the tension of the bow body and reduce the shooting range.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If you want to get a higher range, you can only use a harder bow with a larger draw weight.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The bow body of the English longbow is bent by "bow training".
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The wooden bars used to make the bow body will be fixed on a bracket, and then the two ends of the wooden bars will be tied with ropes.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Then, the bow trainer will pull the rope and hang it on a node not far away, causing the wooden bar to begin to bend slightly.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After a period of time, the wooden strips adapt to the bending, and then the bending is increased...and so on until the wooden strips adapt to the bending required for making a long bow.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     In fact, the secret of making the English longbow has been a secret unique to England for a long time.

     Because the English longbowmen are the British's trump card.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     It was not until around 1596, that is, in the late reign of Elizabeth I, that the British officially gave up the longbowmen, that the secret of British bow training became popular.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     But at that time, Europe was already dominated by muskets.

    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     However, the longbowmen were eliminated not because the longbowmen were incapable of killing, but because the training cost of the longbowmen was too high.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     An excellent longbowman may need to train for more than ten years, or at least a few years.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     For example, Marin was proficient in using the English longbow in his previous life, and it took him seven or eight years to become proficient in archery and hunting.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     At the beginning, Marin's archery was less reliable than the national football team's.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After all, he didn't have any famous teachers to teach him, so he relied on tips from the Internet to practice archery.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Even making the English longbow was based on a post I saw on the Internet around 2006, and then I made it according to the steps on the post.
=======
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Last night, Marin thought about it for half the night, and became more determined to seek refuge with Emperor Maximilian 1st of the Shinra.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Because, although Maximilian 1st was a poor man, as an emperor, he was able to give himself a high enough status.

     Longbowmen need so much time to train, but what about musketeers?
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Just a week or two of training is enough.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     In the battle formation, no matter how long you have trained, whether you are hit by an arrow or a gun, you will still be killed or wounded.
=======
     As a time traveler, and having read so many time travel novels, I have a lot of ways to make money in my mind.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     But in this era of domineering nobles, without status, no matter how much wealth you have, you can't keep it.

<<<<<<< HEAD
     The cost for the British to train longbowmen was very high.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Even the longbowmen became the most privileged class in Britain after the knights.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     And every death of a longbowman was a huge loss for Britain.
=======
     Therefore, Marin needs to use the emperor to obtain a high enough social status to prevent others from coveting his wealth.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     And how to obtain social status (that is, a title)?
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Very simple, military exploits!
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     As a graduate of the history department, Marin has read Western history and knows that in the "Thirty Years' War" that took place in the 17th century, there were two talented military strategists who came from humble backgrounds but became great nobles with their military exploits - Wallenstein and Tilly.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     These two bosses were all from ordinary declining noble families, and were not children of any big nobles.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     However, relying on the great achievements of commanding mercenaries to fight for the great nobles, one of the two low-level prostitutes in the aristocratic world became a duke (Wallenstein) and the other an earl (Tilley).
>>>>>>> d64fdbf (changing to ree novel)
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Marin may not have the talent of Wallenstein, but there is still no problem compared with Tilly, who only relies on a "Spanish square" to conquer the world.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     At least, he knows how to play the Spanish Grand Square.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     General Cordoba, the original author of the Spanish Grand Phalanx, had to wait until 1503 to figure out the prototype of the "Spanish Grand Phalanx" that lasted for more than a century.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     But Marin knows this tactic very well.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Marin even knows the Dutch Morris Square, which is more powerful than the Spanish Grand Square, and the Gustav Line Formation, which is close to the modern battle formation.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     As for using Chapo's artillery tactics, there is no need to talk about it.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     As for the tactics adopted after the mid-19th century, it is useless even to think about them.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Because there are no such advanced weapons.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After all, Marin is a liberal arts student. Although he is good at science, he is not a major.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, the most he can get is a flintlock or something.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If he wanted to get a breech-loading gun, he couldn't solve the primer technology.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     This technology requires chemistry professionals to solve...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Of course, the above is purely Marin's YY.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If you want to use your "talent", you must first get into the mercenaries recruited by Maximilian 1st.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Otherwise, nothing is possible.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     To get into the German mercenary army formed by Maximilian 1st, you must first reach Vienna, the home base of the Habsburg family.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After reconquering Austria from the Kingdom of Hungary in 1490, Maximilian 1st moved his office from the Duchy of Burgundy back to Vienna.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Although the emperor often stayed in Innsbruck in western Austria, many important matters were still handled in Vienna.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     A major event like recruiting soldiers must also be done in Vienna.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Now, if you want to join the army, you must go to Vienna.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     However, from Bonn to Vienna, it is about 800 kilometers away, which is more than 1,600 miles.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Marin is now wearing heavy armor and carrying a huge knight's gun.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Although Carl is a good war horse, with such a heavy load, he can only walk more than a hundred miles a day, stop and go, otherwise it will be too much.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     In fact, the average plate knight would bring five attendants with him when he went into battle to help him get his armor and knight's gun.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Before the battle, he was also responsible for putting on plate armor and helping the knight onto his horse.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Fortunately, Marin didn't have plate armor trousers, otherwise he wouldn't be able to mount his horse.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Because, after all, plate armor trousers are made of all metal, which is bulky and inconvenient, and it greatly hinders the knight's mounting.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Marin calculated that it would take at least ten days for him to arrive in Vienna.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     And he had less than 1,000 pfennig left in his hand, which was not enough at all.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Because, to live in a hotel and eat and drink by himself, he needs about 15 pfennigs a day (usually about 5 pfennigs are for meals, so he eats pretty well).
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     And the damn war horse Karl ate more than him, eating 10 pfennigs of feed a day.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     War horses are very delicate. If a war horse is allowed to eat grass for several months and is not given feed to replenish its body, it may not be able to carry a knight in heavy armor.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Because the feed for war horses is mainly oats (there were no soybeans in Europe at this time, and soybeans were still in East Asia and India, and would not be introduced to Europe until the 18th century at the earliest), and from time to time they would also break a few eggs.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     These gadgets were relatively expensive in medieval Europe where agriculture was backward...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Marin is not a person who just makes a fortune and then sits back. In order to reach Vienna smoothly, Marin decided to try hunting along the way to improve his life.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After all, in his previous life, Marin often took his homemade English longbow to hunt in the mountains behind his hometown during holidays, and he had good archery skills.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After making up his mind, Marin began to pay attention to the shops selling bows and arrows while shopping in Bonn...
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     After wandering a few streets, Marin quickly found a weapons store selling bows and arrows.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Looking at the dazzling array of bows and arrows in the weapon shop, Marin frowned.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     why?
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Because there is no English longbow that Marin is most familiar with in the store.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Marin later made an English longbow himself and used it to hunt many times in the mountains behind his hometown.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Therefore, Marin has only been exposed to one type of bow and arrow, and is only proficient in one type - the English longbow.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Although Marin did not use yew wood to make the English longbow, but rather common willow wood in China, Marin was used to the English longbow.
    </font>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     The biggest difference between the English longbow and other bows and arrows is that the bow body of other bows and arrows is forcibly bent and fixed, and then heated by fire to force it into a fixed shape.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     Although this method is more efficient to make, it will damage the tension of the bow body and reduce the shooting range.
    </font>
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
     If you want to get a higher range, you can only use a harder bow with a larger draw weight.
    </font>

   火枪兵则不同，随便一个老实巴交的农奴，抓来培训一两个星期，就能使用火枪作战。即便死了，补充也方便。火枪兵死光了，大不了再抓一批壮丁来训练一两个星期。但长弓兵要是成建制地被灭，可能很多年都缓不过来。
  </p>
  <p>
   而且，长弓兵和火枪兵最大的区别在于，火枪兵可以对付身穿板甲的敌人。而长弓兵，却对板甲有些束手无策。鉴于种种原因，英国人最终放弃了曾让他们很自豪的长弓兵，转而使用火枪兵。
  </p>
  <p>
   不过呢，火枪大放异彩，其实是在1503年西班牙大方阵出现之后。现在是1494年，火枪兵还没冒头。就连火绳枪，也是1450年左右才出现的。
  </p>
  <p>
   这年头，可不像后来，技术能推广那么快。火绳枪出现了40多年了，目前还没啥人注意到火绳枪的优秀战斗力。同样地，16世纪末法国就出现了燧发枪，但直到17世纪中期，燧发枪才慢慢普及开来。
  </p>
  <p>
   这也难怪，要知道，中世纪还是教会的天下，一切科学知识其实是被教会压制的，科技传播速度很慢。而且，新的科技知识也需要证明自己。
  </p>
  <p>
   比如，火绳枪就是在贡萨洛?德?科尔多瓦在察里诺拉战役中依靠长矛和火枪组成的方阵大败法军后，才声名鹊起，在欧洲得到推广的。同样地，燧发枪也是在“三十年战争'中大放异彩后，才被欧洲各国重视的。
  </p>
  <p>
   现在的欧洲，火绳枪还属于稀罕玩意儿。就连波恩这样的城市，出售火枪的也少。倒是出售弓箭的，有好几家铺子。
  </p>
  <p>
   而且，欧洲目前钢铁技术不过关，制造出的枪炮老是炸膛。比如，苏格兰国王约翰二世，就是因为火炮炸膛，而在1460年死于非命。要到16世纪，欧洲钢铁技术进一步发展后，枪炮炸膛事故才会大大降低。
  </p>
  <p>
   因为没有自己熟悉的英格兰长弓，马林只好退而求其次，购买了一把拉力约60磅的反曲弓，并购买了30支箭。

   事实上，不管是后世的马林，还是现在的小马林，都是可以拉开100磅拉力的强弓的。后世的马林不用说，是个壮硕的农村青年，农活没少干，所以力气大。
  </p>
  <p>
   而这一世的马林，虽然才16岁，可也是从小接受骑士的武艺训练，力气也不小，是可以拉开100磅的强弓的。
  </p>
  <p>
   但是，马林知道，类似英格兰长弓这样的强弓，成年人还好。若是少年时期拉多了这样的强弓，容易造成后脊椎弯曲变形。比如，后世就考证过，某些中世纪的英格兰长弓手，因为从小训练拉强弓，导致脊椎变形。
  </p>
  <p>
   马林现在的这具身体，可还是正在成长中的16岁少年。他可不想因为使用多了强弓，而导致脊椎长歪了。因此，他选择了一把60磅拉力的普通反曲弓，作为自己的狩猎武器。
  </p>
  <p>
   可是，原先的马林的记忆里没有弓箭的使用方法，而后世的马林只熟悉英格兰长弓。所以，马林花费了好几天的时间，才熟悉了反曲弓的使用。
  </p>
  <p>
   经过测试，这把反曲弓的有效射程，在100米内。但是，能瞄准的距离，只有50米左右。用于杀敌威力可能不够，但用于打猎，却是够用了。
  </p>
  <p>
   熟悉了反曲弓的使用后，马林就离开了波恩，一边往维也纳方向赶路，一边开始使用反曲弓打猎....
  </p>
  <p>
   但让马林郁闷无比的是，很长一段时间内，他都没有打到猎物....
  </p>
  <p>
   这是为什么呢？很简单，马林这厮，想学习蒙古骑兵，来个骑射啥的。然后，就杯具了....
  </p>
  <p>
   说起来，马林的射术，放到现代，那是很不错的。能在丛林里射中猎物，箭法也算可以的了。
  </p>
  <p>
   但是，那是在地面上....
  </p>
  <p>
   而且，马林从前打猎，看书www．一般是带着弓箭，悄悄地摸到丛林里，看到没有防备的猎物后，偷袭得手。这基本相当于射固定靶，对于高速移动中的猎物，马林的命中率其实不高。
  </p>
  <p>
   而骑在马上射箭....哎，说多了全是泪啊....
  </p>
  <p>
   骑在马上和后世坐在汽车上完全是不同的概念，汽车有减震装置，公路也很平。而骑马，那可是一上一下地颠簸啊....
  </p>
  <p>
   所以，想玩骑射的马林，明明瞄准了猎物，可马匹上下一颠簸，箭支立马打了灰机....
  </p>
  <p>
   而且，他骑着马，马蹄的声响难免惊动那些猎物，导致小动物们提前四处奔逃。而马林只是射固定靶比较厉害些，对于高速移动的小动物们，却是有些束手无策。
  </p>
  <p>
   连续七天，马林都没能靠着骑射打到一只猎物。好在他之前卖马鹿有些积蓄，否则，他肯定得饿死。同样，也正是因为有点积蓄，他才敢这么玩。
  </p>
  <p>
   “骑射果然不简单啊！'马林一脸忧桑。
  </p>
  <p>
   想想也是，人家匈奴人和蒙古人，五岁就开始骑着羊玩弹弓了。等到长大了，基本上等于练习了十几年的骑射。即便如此，人家练了十几年的“老司机'，也不敢说骑在高速奔跑的马背上能稳稳地射中奔跑中的猎物，何况他这个新手？
  </p>
  <p>
   所以，骑射虽然帅，却是靠着很多年的苦练，以及一些天赋，才能掌握。对于马林这种半吊子，骑射基本就是在赌概率，被他射中的猎物，都是命中该有一劫的倒霉蛋....
