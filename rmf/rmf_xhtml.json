Reader discretion is advised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ***\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In 78 BC, the Roman dictator Sulla passed away, and the Roman Republic entered the post-Sullan era.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In 76 BC, the Roman Senate decided to send the 29-year-old Pompey to lead an army to the province of Hispania to suppress the rebellion of Sertorius. This made him the second Roman to command an army before the age of 39 in the military history of the Roman Republic, following in the footsteps of Scipio Africanus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the same year, the 24-year-old Caesar went to study in Rhodes but was kidnapped by pirates along the way. He willingly paid a ransom of 50 talents. Upon safely reaching the shore, he immediately recruited men, trained an army, and launched a surprise attack on the pirates, successfully capturing them all and reclaiming his money.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Also in the same year, the 37-year-old Crassus made a fortune in Rome through lending and real estate, but this tarnished his reputation. Unwilling to see the younger Pompey basking in glory, he began to campaign and prepare to run for the position of praetor in the Roman Senate a year later.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …………………………………………..\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Xu Tianyu deeply regretted it. If he had known, he wouldn’t have agreed to the dinner invitation from his high school classmate. As a result, during the meal, he drank quite a bit of alcohol, and his classmate got into a conflict with a customer at the neighboring table. He tried to mediate but was accidentally pushed and hit his head on the edge of the table, instantly losing consciousness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the moment of losing his consciousness, a thought flashed through his mind: “It’s a pity that I haven’t even played the old game ‘Total War: Rome II’ that I just bought!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He didn’t know how long had passed when the noisy voices awakened his consciousness: “Crixus, you hit too hard, Maximus was killed by you!” someone exclaimed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “He died from just one punch? This traitor got off easy. He betrayed us, I wish I could tear him apart!” It was a loud and fierce voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “It’s not all Maximus’ fault. Batiatus must have heard the rumors beforehand, that’s why he sent Maximus to inquire. Faced with that wicked wolf, not everyone has the courage to keep a secret. Moreover, he could have concealed it when he returned, but he immediately confessed to us, saving us from the wolf’s clutches when we were completely unaware. From this perspective, he did us a great favor. Crixus, you shouldn’t have been so impulsive!” It was a low and gentle voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Hmph, this coward ruined our plan and put us all in danger. Should we be grateful to him?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Spartacus, Crixus, stop arguing. The situation is critical. What should we do?” A clear voice rang out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Artorix, don’t panic. We were already planning to start a rebellion soon. Although Batiatus knows about it, he probably doesn’t know that Maximus has already told us the truth. We must act immediately, gather everyone while the wolf is not prepared, overthrow the guards here, and then escape!” The gentle voice was now filled with stirring power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The previous fierce voice immediately responded, “You’re right, we must act immediately! Let’s quickly inform our brothers!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Clang! Clang! Clang!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the voices faded, a series of metal clanging sounds echoed, followed by a cold voice in Xu Tianyu’s ear, “Spartacus, Crixus, the master wants to see you, he wants to consult you about the upcoming arena match the day after tomorrow.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Bad news, Batiatus is definitely planning to harm you two!” the clear voice urgently whispered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We were just worrying about how to open that iron gate, and he arrived just in time!” the gentle voice was now filled with joy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The fierce voice whispered knowingly, “Yes, Spartacus and I will pretend to obey orders, but as soon as we step out of that iron gate, we will immediately take out the two guards outside the gate!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “But the two guards outside the gate are well-equipped and not weak, while you two are unarmed——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “So when Crixus and I launch the attack, Artorix, you must immediately lead our brothers from the other rooms to rush out. Whether we can gain freedom or not depends on how fast you are!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I understand. Rest assured, Spartacus!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then the gentle voice shouted loudly, “Got it, Crixus and I are coming!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Listening to the footsteps receding, Xu Tianyu was filled with disbelief:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     Spartacus, Crixus… Is this from the old American TV series “Spartacus: Blood and Sand”? But these voices sound like they are really happening around me! And they are not speaking English, but a strange language that I can understand. What is going on?!\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He struggled to open his heavy eyelids, but suddenly a flood of information rushed into his mind:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …Maximus, born and raised as a slave by a rising Roman equestrian family, and the son of an Illyrian slave and a Thracian slave. He showed linguistic talent from a young age, and his master, seeing his intelligence, decided to let him study with his son so that he could manage the estate and business in the future, becoming a trusted aide to his son. Year after year, Maximus excelled in his studies and remained loyal to the young master. His master’s expectations were being fulfilled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unexpectedly, when Maximus was 13 years old, Sulla led his army into Rome, became a dictator, and began a bloodbath against the populares. Unfortunately, his master was on Sulla’s purge list, and soon after, his master’s whole family was massacred by the mob. Maximus was then sent to the slave market in Capua and eventually bought by Batiatus, the owner of the ludus (gladiator school).\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Batiatus, who usually liked to buy barbarian prisoners of war from slave traders to serve as gladiators, had his own reasons for buying Maximus. Perhaps due to the advantage of “hybridization”, the still underage Maximus grew tall and strong, appearing to be excellent for gladiator combat. Additionally, Maximus was a house-born slave, obedient and well-behaved, unlike the wild barbarian gladiators, making it easier for Batiatus to control him. Furthermore, Maximus was proficient in various barbarian languages and literate, allowing him to blend in with the barbarian gladiators and gather information for Batiatus to prevent any unexpected incidents. After all, these barbarians were hard to tame, and they often caused trouble, unlike the Roman citizens who volunteered to become gladiators due to debts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Batiatus had his own plans, but little did he know that after Maximus became a gladiator, he was influenced by Spartacus and joined his rebellion plan. Using his relatively free status as a gladiator, Maximus secretly passed on information between the gladiator barracks, keeping Spartacus and other leaders informed about the changes in the outside world, thus perfecting their uprising plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, it was impossible to keep a rebellion involving over two hundred gladiators completely secret. Batiatus heard some rumors and summoned Maximus for questioning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under his ruthless interrogation, Maximus’s inherent obedience to his master took over, and he confessed to Batiatus about the gladiators planning a revolt. To prevent the gladiators from becoming suspicious, Batiatus warned Maximus not to tell anyone that he knew about the plan. If Maximus could do that, Batiatus would forgive his mistake.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus agreed obediently, but when he saw Spartacus and realized that this man who had taken care of him like a father figure might die because of this, he couldn’t help but show shame and sadness on his face. This led Spartacus to suspect something, and after repeated questioning, Maximus, who, overwhelmed by guilt, confessed the truth. In a fit of anger, Crixus struck him with a powerful blow, causing his head to hit the uneven stone wall and fall unconscious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (From now on, the protagonist will be referred to as Maximus.)\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ***\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     Translator: Kindan\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 2": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 2 – Uprising (I)\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     I have been reborn? Reborn as this gladiator named Maximus?!\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus realized something, but he was unwilling to believe it was true, preferring to think it was just a dream. However, as he struggled to open his eyes, what appeared before him was a dark and cramped room. There were no windows, no wooden doors, only uneven stone walls, a floor covered in dusty soil, a tattered wooden bed with a straw mattress on top… The air was filled with nauseating sweat and the stench of excrement and urine. What a terrible living environment!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To make matters worse, his ears were filled with piercing shouts. Countless fierce, shirtless men were shouting and running towards the iron gate…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     This is not a dream!\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus subconsciously clenched his fists, but felt a sharp pain in his chest. It was the injury caused by Crixus’ blow. However, he didn’t have the mind to think about it at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     Spartacus… Crixus… gladiator school… Batiatus… Could it be that I have been reborn in the ancient Roman times during the Spartacus uprising? And now is the crucial moment when Spartacus leads the gladiators in a riot at the gladiator school?!\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of all this, Maximus realized that he had to escape from here with these gladiators. Otherwise, the only fate awaiting him would be crucifixion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus propped himself up with his hands and stood up with great difficulty. His head was still dizzy as he staggered towards the door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Outside the door was a long, narrow corridor, with a few sparse torches inserted on the stone walls on both sides. The weak and lonely flames cast some light in this dim corridor, and the swaying shadows only added to the eerie and terrifying atmosphere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There were many small rooms on both sides of the corridor, like dog holes chiseled into the stone walls. The space inside could barely accommodate one person lying down. Thinking that the original owner of his current body had lived in such a dreadful environment, Maximus couldn’t help but shudder and made up his mind to escape from here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He looked at the gladiators running ahead and staggered to catch up. Gradually… his head no longer felt dizzy, and his body became more agile…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ahead, a row of iron bars blocked the entire corridor, with thick iron rods deeply embedded in the ground and stone walls, making it seemingly impenetrable. Fortunately, the iron door in the middle has already been opened. Maximus lowered his head and squeezed through the iron door.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the other side of the iron door, he saw three bodies lying below the stairs, almost turned into a pile of mud by countless trampling.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The bloody and terrifying scene frightened Maximus, who came from a peaceful era, but his body did not have the corresponding nauseous vomiting reaction. Yes, the original Maximus, although a mediocre gladiator, had been here for several years, had been to the arena, and had killed people. He had seen even bloodier scenes and was not a newcomer to this…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus ran up the stairs and felt a refreshing breath of air. The air was fresh, and the light was soft and bright. Above him was a sky adorned with brilliant sunset hues. However, countless gladiators were congested in front, preventing him from moving forward. Voices kept shouting, “Brothers, give it your all! Push aside those guards that are blocking us, and we will be free!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the memory of the previous Maximus, after leaving the corridor and ascending the stairs, there was a training ground. It was a large courtyard capable of accommodating 300 gladiators training together. But now they were crowded at the entrance and unable to move forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Brother, what’s happening up ahead?” Maximus couldn’t help asking a gladiator in front.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Batiatus’ guards are blocking us——” The gladiator turned his head to reply, but before the gladiator could finish his sentence, a shadow flashed by, and the gladiator let out a scream as an arrow pierced his neck, causing him to fall to the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Watch out for arrows!” someone shouted hoarsely, causing a commotion in the crowd.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus fearfully followed suit, crouching like the others with his eyes alertly scanning upward. On the other side of the training ground, there stood a three-story building with two guards holding bows and arrows on the second-floor balcony. On the third-floor balcony, a middle-aged man in a light gray robe, with a fierce face, was waving his fists and shouting loudly. This man was the Lanista (the trainer of a gladiator school), Batiatus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Amidst his shouting, the guards on the balcony shot arrows again, causing two more gladiators to fall, while at the same time, there were screams from the front, indicating that the guards blocking the gladiators had also drawn their short swords.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the gladiators outnumbered the guards, they were unarmed, while the guards were fully armed and, with Batiatus’ permission, they attacked without hesitation. The guards’ short swords continuously stabbed at the gladiators, causing the gladiators to fall and preventing them from breaking through guards’ defense line.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gladiators’ screams were continuous, but did not deter their comrades. After all, the gladiator’s profession was to kill or be killed by their opponents. Most gladiators had long disregarded life and death, and their companions’ injuries and deaths only fueled their ferocity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Brothers, Batiatus wants to kill us! Let’s fight back!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Charge! Knocked them down! I will bite off the throats of these bastards!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gladiators roared like wild beasts, disregarding the enemy’s swords and arrows. Those behind pushed forward, pressing against the backs of those in front, advancing with determination. Occasionally, someone fell, but others quickly took their place…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The guards were being pushed back, leaving gaps in their shield wall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Hamilcar, take the brothers to the kitchen and get weapons!” a deep voice, likely Spartacus, shouted over the chaos.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus, through the memory of the previous owner of his current body, felt puzzled:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     Are there weapons in the kitchen?\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But then he realized:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     Kitchen knives, forks, and pots could serve as weapons. Also, the benches and wooden tables in the adjacent dining hall could be used as weapons as well.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar, a gladiator with a robust physique and visibly aged facial appearance, gestured and led the charge through the gap. An arrow was immediately shot at him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although not the top-ranked gladiator in the school, Hamilcar had experienced facing archers in group combat in the arena before. As he ran, he kept his eyes on the archers on the balcony. When one of them pulled the bowstring, he rolled forward to dodge the arrow, then rolled to the side to avoid another arrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Indeed, both archers were targeting him, but once Hamilcar entered the training ground, he had enough space to evade them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the archers reloaded their bows, some gladiators also rushed into the training ground, sprinting towards the building where Batiatus was located.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the memory of the original Maximus, the current Maximus knew that the gladiators’ kitchen and dining hall were on the ground floor of that building, but there was no direct access to the second and third floors.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Upon seeing the archers aim at the gladiators heading for the dining hall, Maximus didn’t rush out with them. However, he kept his attention on that area because he knew that in order to overcome their current predicament, they needed the gladiators who went to retrieve weapons.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soon, Maximus saw Hamilcar and a few others swiftly emerge from the dining hall on the ground floor. They took two steps outside, turned around, and waved their hands upwards, executing a well-coordinated movement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Suddenly, one of the archers on the second-floor balcony clutched his neck and fell down, causing the other archer to quickly crouch down behind the railing in fear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other gladiators also emerged from the dining hall. Some wielded kitchen knives, others had pots and spoons, and some carried benches. They attacked the guards who were still engaged in fierce combat at the entrance to the barracks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    These 20-plus guards included retired veterans and former gladiators who had gained their freedom. They not only had the responsibility of ensuring the school’s security, but some of them were also mentors who trained these gladiators. They were experienced in combat and fully armed with helmets, breastplates, greaves, long shields, and short swords. However, outnumbered by the gladiators, they were eventually overwhelmed and defeated one by one.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 3": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 3 – Uprising (II)\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    Some of the training instructors knelt and begged for mercy, but unfortunately, the Batiatus’ gladiator school was known for its harsh training. Over the years, many gladiators had died on the training grounds. There was no bond of affection between the instructors and the gladiators, only endless resentment. This was one of the main reasons why they were willing to join Spartacus in this rebellion. Therefore, without mercy, they stabbed the begging guards to death one by one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Batiatus has run away!” someone shouted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus subconsciously looked up and indeed, there was no sign of Batiatus on the balcony of the three-story building.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Forget about that wicked wolf. It’s getting dark, and we need to escape from here quickly,” Spartacus said in a deep voice. “Hamilcar, take some of our brothers to the kitchen and pack up all the food we can take.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Alright.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Crixus, you are in charge of selecting some of our brothers who are capable of fighting and equipping them with the armor and weapons of these people.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Got it.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Oenomaus, you bring a few strong brothers with me to break open the main gate,” Spartacus continued. “Artorix, you take the others and help bandage the wounded brothers. After the gate is opened, take them with you to leave.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gladiators in the school had been planning the rebellion for some time now. Several leaders had emerged, with Spartacus at the forefront and Crixus, Artorix, Hamilcar, and Oenomaus as his aides. After Spartacus assigned the tasks, they immediately went to carry them out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus was worried about being seen by Crixus, who might publicly accuse him of betraying everyone, causing anger and harm to himself. So, when he saw a wounded gladiator lying not far away, he immediately crouched beside him and pretended to be concerned, asking, “Brother, how are your injuries?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Oh, Maximus, please help me! My right thigh was stabbed deeply by a sword, it hurts so much I can’t stand,” the gladiator groaned and cried to Maximus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His face was very familiar, and in the memory of the previous Maximus, the current Maximus found his name: Phaselus, a young and former Illyrian pirate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In recent years, Illyrian pirates had been rampant, frequently plundering ships traveling to and from Italy. Rome had to send warships to patrol the surrounding waters of Italy day and night to eliminate these Illyrian pirates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Phaselus’ pirate ship was captured by a Roman warship, and the leader was beheaded on the spot. The remaining crew members, including him, became slaves and were sent to various towns in Italy to be sold. Slaves like them were usually not purchased as household slaves by the Romans but were often sent to mines and gladiator arenas.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The actual personality of Phaselus was lively and cheerful. It was only because of his difficult life and the need for survival that he had to become a sailor on a pirate ship. When he first arrived at the gladiator school six months ago, he couldn’t adapt to the harsh training at all. Maximus, who had half Illyrian blood, actively helped him multiple times, and as a result, they became good friends.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at the bloody sword wound on Phaselus’ sturdy right thigh, Maximus gently pressed around the wound according to the memory of the original Maximus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Phaselus endured the pain and let out a hissing groan through his clenched teeth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The bleeding isn’t too severe. It shouldn’t have cut any blood vessels, and your foot can still move, so there shouldn’t be any severed tendons either. You’re lucky. With some time to heal, your injury will be fine,” Maximus said, looking relieved for him. The profession of a gladiator is to kill, and besides training them in combat skills, the instructors also teach them some knowledge of human anatomy to help them defeat opponents and protect themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Phaselus didn’t feel much at ease despite Maximus’ reassurance. He worriedly asked, “Maximus, I’m injured now and can’t escape on my own. Will you all leave me behind?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus hesitated for a moment. In his heart, as a newcomer to this world, he had no emotional ties with anyone here, and his own situation wasn’t great either. But from the memory of the previous Maximus, Phaselus was one of the few gladiators who respected him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason for this respect was somewhat complicated. Although Maximus had been living in this gladiator school for several years and was considered one of the older residents, he was still under 20 years old. Despite his strong physique and decent combat skills, he had a gentle temperament and lacked ruthlessness. He often lost to other gladiators during training, and Batiatus never arranged risky one-on-one matches for him. So, although he had a good relationship with the other gladiators, they looked down on him from the bottom of their hearts.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His name revealed this as well. “Maximus” was not his real name but a nickname given to him by the gladiators. Maximus meant “greatest”, but his poor gladiatorial record clearly didn’t match up to that name. It was everyone’s way of mocking him, and they often referred to him as such. Over time, it became his gladiator name (gladiators rarely used their real names; they either received titles from the audience based on their fighting style and record or chose names according to their own preferences).\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As Phaselus had only recently arrived, the previous Maximus had taken care of him, and they were also from the same hometown, so his attitude towards Maximus was quite different from that of the other gladiators.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus, who was new to this world and felt extremely lonely, instinctively didn’t want to lose the trust of the person in front of him, so he quickly said, “Don’t worry, Spartacus will definitely not abandon you. I will support you when the time comes.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Maximus, thank you!” Phaselus was moved to the point of tears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus felt a slight sense of shame in his heart. He was merely speaking empty words. If Spartacus truly decided to abandon these injured gladiators, he wouldn’t oppose it. On the contrary, he would be relieved. After all, Phaselus, with his leg injury, would slow down their escape. Maximus avoided Phaselus’ grateful gaze and looked around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus had already selected more than twenty gladiators, who were now stripping the armor from the guards and putting it on themselves…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, the reason Crixus was moving so quickly was that he hadn’t followed Spartacus’ instructions for selection at all. Instead, he had given all the equipment from the fallen guards to the Gallic gladiators who followed him. The gladiators in this school were mainly composed of Gauls and Thracians, and Crixus was the leader of the Gallic gladiators.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others were taking care of their injured comrades. Among the crowd, Maximus spotted someone very familiar. His eyes shifted, and he whispered to Phaselus, “Look, Pequot is over there. Thank goodness, he’s not injured.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Phaselus turned to look and couldn’t help but shout, “Pequot!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gladiator named Pequot had a dark skin and a muscular physique. Upon hearing Phaselus’ shout, he immediately walked over in large strides. Without saying a word, he forcefully tore off his own linen undershirt and began to bandage Phaselus’ wound.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the memory original Maximus, Pequot was Phaselus’ fellow pirate on the same ship, and one of the only two Illyrians in this school. Unlike Phaselus, Pequot had been a pirate for many years. He was always silent in gladiator school, but fierce and ruthless during training which matched his fierce appearance, so some experienced gladiators didn’t want to provoke him. The previous Maximus had tried to befriend him, but Pequot had always maintained an indifferent attitude towards him. However, he had a good relationship with Phaselus, his former companion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a while, Spartacus, Crixus, Artorix, Oenomaus, and Hamilcar gathered again in the center of the training ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The main gate has been smashed open,” Spartacus asked directly, “Hamilcar, how much food did you manage to find?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We only found five and a half bags of barley and a palm-sized piece of smoked meat,” Hamilcar replied. “I also had our brothers bring the copper pots and clay pots from the kitchen.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “With the stinginess of the wicked wolf Batiatus, there won’t be anything good left in the kitchen,” Crixus said with a bitter tone.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 4": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 4 – Spartacus\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    “Just enough for everyone to have a meal.” Spartacus looked at Crixus and asked, “Have our brothers finished equipping all the weapons and armor?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Yes,” Crixus grinned and pointed behind himself, “20 brothers have all put on infantry equipment, and with you and me taking down the guard at the iron gate and changing into these outfits, plus an archer falling from the balcony… We now have twenty-two infantry and one archer. If anyone dares to stop us again, we can crush them like ants!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Roar!” The fully armed gladiators behind him roared, causing others on the training ground to look back in astonishment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus scanned these fully armored gladiators and noticed that they were all Gauls. He nodded and calmly said, “We’ll rely on you if we encounter enemies while escaping.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Don’t worry, I’ll lead them at the front,” Crixus replied confidently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “How are the injuries of our brothers?” Spartacus then looked at Artorix.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Artorix replied in a low voice, “21 dead, 11 seriously wounded, and 32 slightly wounded…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The leaders of the gladiators fell into silence at the same time. The school had a total of 295 gladiators, and this uprising had mobilized all of them, resulting in a high casualty count of 64, which was more than one-fifth of their number.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus quickly regained his composure and said in a deep voice, “For the slightly wounded, let our brothers take turns carrying them. For the seriously wounded… let them depart without suffering.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Understood,” Crixus responded and went to carry out the order with his men.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thus, Maximus saw these gladiators approaching their unconscious and seriously injured comrades, closing their eyes and silently reciting a prayer before drawing their short swords and piercing their chests directly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one stopped them, nor did anyone raise objections. Since the day they became gladiators, they had dealt with death and had long grown accustomed to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But this greatly shocked Maximus and also horrified his injured companion, Phaselus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, Spartacus spoke loudly, “Brothers, after our bloody battle, we have broken free from the cage set by Batiatus for us! The gates are now open, but as you escape from this school, do not forget that many of the guards you killed were Roman citizens! The wicked wolf Batiatus must have already sought help from the officials in Capua. Romans are always cruel to slaves who betray their masters. They will surely send troops to hunt us down, capture us, nail us to cross, and torture us to death!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Do not forget the strength of the Romans. They control all of Italy and the entire Mediterranean. Trying to escape and hide alone will not work. We must unite tightly and gather all our strength. Only when we have the strength to overcome one difficulty after another can we finally achieve true freedom!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he finished speaking, there were immediate shouts from other gladiators, “Spartacus, rest assured, I will not run around. I will follow you all the way!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Right, Spartacus, you have the best plan. We believe in you and will fight alongside you!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Spartacus, you are our leader. Under your guidance, we will tear apart any Romans who dare to stop us!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The shouts of the gladiators continued, eventually merging into an excited roar:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Spartacus! Spartacus!!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus curiously gazed at Spartacus standing in front:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     This real Spartacus bears no resemblance to the actors who portray him in the movies and TV series from the past. He is tall and muscular, but not bulky. His brown, curly hair, soaked with sweat, gently drapes over his broad forehead. With his long, oval face, slightly pointed chin, prominent nose, large and bright eyes with a particularly spirited brown iris, long and thick eyelashes, and a reserved smile…\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A phrase popped into Maximus’s mind: “A face as gentle as a lamb.” This image did not match his physique, but it was this contradiction that gave a strong sense of familiarity. Perhaps it was because of this that the school’s top gladiator, who was undefeated in the arena, was so trusted and followed by everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus put on the Roman-style helmet left by the guard he had killed. The lingering glow of the sunset reflected upon it, forming a hazy halo that made it especially dazzling. His gaze was resolute as he waved forcefully, “Follow me, let’s leave this place!” With that, he rushed towards the gate, followed closely by the armed gladiators, and then by the unarmed ones carrying their injured companions on their backs…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without hesitation, Pequot lifted Phaselus onto his back. Maximus said from the side, “Pequot if you get tired, you can let me carry him.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pequot ignored him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gladiator school was surrounded by walls over four meters high, with a thick oak door and a large iron lock, it can be said that it was heavily fortified. Although the iron lock on the gate was not opened, a large hole had been smashed into the wooden door, and the edges were smoothed out with short swords. Thinking of the incredible strength of Oenomaus and the other Germanic people in the previous Maximus’ memories, Maximus was not surprised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Passing through the hole, they found themselves in a narrow, winding alleyway…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Capua was once the capital of the Campanian League and remains the primary city in the region. Gladiator games were very popular here, and it was one of the first towns within Roman territory to build a gladiator arena. Some Capuans even proudly claim that “gladiator games originated in Capua.” As a result, there were over ten privately operated gladiator schools here.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Capuans loved watching gladiator competitions, but they didn’t want to live with these murderous monsters who killed for a living. The constant noisy fights from the gladiator schools were also annoying. Many years ago, the citizens of Capua collectively demanded that all gladiator schools be moved outside the city. However, schools with hundreds or even thousands of gladiators couldn’t operate without daily supervision. Eventually, these schools were required to be built near the city walls, so the soldiers patrolling the walls could keep an eye on them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With the expansion and conquests of the Romans, Rome became the center of the Mediterranean. A huge amount of wealth and slaves poured into Rome, and countless foreigners and poor people came to Rome in search of survival and opportunities. Capua, not far from Rome and with a better environment, became a destination for their migration. The inner city of Capua couldn’t accommodate a large number of immigrants, so they began building houses outside the city. Due to the lack of unified planning and self-will of the immigrants, the houses in the outer city of Capua were disorderly, the alleys were narrow, and the roads were poor, resembling a large maze.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Normally, Spartacus and his companions would enter the arena directly under the guard of Batiatus’ men. After the matches, they would immediately be taken back to the school. Batiatus never gave them the right to go out alone, which was also related to the fact that most of them were criminals or war captives.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the sky darkened, the gladiators suddenly stopped running after a while because they encountered a dead end ahead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus couldn’t help but feel anxious. He scanned the closed wooden doors on both sides of the alley and said firmly, “Break open the doors, grab two people, and have them show us the way!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “No need for that trouble, I know the way. I’ll lead the way!” Someone in the crowd shouted loudly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus looked over and was somewhat surprised. “Maximus? You’re still alive?!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I just passed out. Later, when I woke up, I saw you fighting with the guards at the entrance to the training ground, so I joined the battle…” Maximus said as he walked towards Spartacus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason he dared to step forward at this moment was that he realized the previous Maximus’ actions were too despicable. If the gladiators found out, he could only imagine what would happen. So, he couldn’t continue to do nothing and had to actively contribute to gain Spartacus’ protection and reduce everyone’s animosity towards him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ***\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     Author’s Note:\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The historical records about Spartacus mention that there were over 200 gladiators in the gladiator school where Spartacus was located. However, there are two different accounts regarding the number of people who escaped after the riot.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One version says that Spartacus led a charge into the kitchen, wielding cooking utensils as weapons, and ultimately only around 70 gladiators managed to escape after the riot. Another version, as described in this book, presents a different narrative.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I still remember reading a world-renowned work titled “Spartacus” written by an Italian author in my childhood. It mentioned that there were over ten thousand gladiators in the gladiator school where Spartacus was situated. However, this seems to be an exaggeration, and such a massive scale is likely only found in Rome’s gladiator school during the Roman Empire era.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 5": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 5 – Serving as a Guide\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    “You traitor, how dare you show your face!” Crixus immediately rushed forward, grabbing his chest and raising a huge fist. His scarred face had a pair of wolf-like eyes, emitting a fierce and menacing light. He viciously said, “You’ve killed so many of our brothers, and now——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Enough, Crixus. Now is not the time for internal strife. We need Maximus’ help!” Sure enough, Spartacus quickly stepped in to stop the confrontation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Ptui!” Crixus spat a thick phlegm onto Maximus’ face before reluctantly being separated by Spartacus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus wiped the phlegm off his face and momentarily felt relieved. If Spartacus hadn’t intervened, he was genuinely afraid that Crixus might have killed him. Based on the memory of the original Maximus, this guy, although was only second best gladiator of the gladiator school, either left his opponents dead or seriously injured in the matches he participated in. Even during training, he often caused injuries to his companions. He was a dangerous man who valued human life very little.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though Crixus had let go, his sharp gaze remained fixed on Maximus, piercing through him like a sharp knife. It sent a chill down Maximus’ spine, making him regret his decision to step forward a little.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Maximus, are you really familiar with the roads here?!” Spartacus asked very seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus collected himself and confidently said, “I grew up in Capua. I can find my way around here with my eyes closed! With me leading the way, we can leave here quickly. However——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus paused for a moment, and continued with a hint of show-off, “Our current location is in the south of the city. From Capua, there are two main roads to the south. One is the Appian Way, heading southeast towards the Samnite Mountains. The other is the Via Annia, heading south, crossing the entire Campanian Plain. Which one should we take?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    South of Rome, Capua was one of the few large cities intersected by two major Roman roads. It was an important transportation hub, thriving not only in agriculture but also in commerce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We should go to the mountainous region, it would be easier for us to hide,” Artorix suggested from the side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “It’s getting dark, and it’s not safe to go to the mountains at this time. Plus, the Samnites are not to be trifled with. We should head south.” Although the uprising was sudden and somewhat hasty, Spartacus had a plan in mind. However, he didn’t intend to reveal it at this moment, so he came up with another reason.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, everyone’s opinions were reasonable. Not far to the east of Capua was the Samnite mountain region. The Samnites were impoverished but fierce, and they were a major source of auctoratus (a term used for those Roman citizens who volunteered to become gladiators). Although they were not from the same gladiator school, they encountered them as opponents in the arena, and their strength should not be underestimated. Therefore, no one objected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Maximus boldly suggested based on the memory of the original Maximus:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Let’s head south from the Via Annia. There’s a Temple of Flora (Flora is a Roman goddess of flowers and spring) by the roadside, about three or 4 kilometers from Capua. When it gets dark, we can rest there.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We’ll talk about it then,” Spartacus replied noncommittally.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus turned and looked to the back of the group. The gladiators’ eyes had already begun to look at him with suspicion, a sign that Crixus’ angry outburst had affected them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus, with a stern face and a short sword in hand, closely followed Maximus, clearly intending to monitor him and prevent him from leading them the wrong way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus felt a bit nervous, but seeing Spartacus beside him, he calmed down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The group set off again. Although they were delayed a bit, the narrow alleys they passed through remained empty. The nearby residents had realized that there was an abnormality in the gladiator school, but no one dared to organize a group to stop these murderous monsters. Instead, they closed their doors and hid.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Guided by Maximus, the gladiators quickly exited the maze-like streets and stepped onto the Via Annia. Many of them breathed a sigh of relief. The wide and solid road increased the speed of the entire group’s advance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As Maximus walked and glanced around, he couldn’t help but marvel at the famous Roman road, despite having the memory of the original Maximus. The smooth and sturdy stone road, deep water ditches on both sides, lush roadside trees, paths for pedestrians, and even simple benches could be seen for people to rest—all these elements were present, resembling modern city roads, and it was built a hundred years ago. With careful maintenance, it still functioned well, revealing a glimpse of Rome’s power.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     How could a powerful nation like this be defeated by a group of gladiators alone?\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A strong sense of unease suddenly surged in Maximus’ heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sun had descended behind the western mountains, and the lingering glow of sunset gradually dissipated as night approached. Normally, there would still be some pedestrians along the road at this time, but the fearsome gladiators scared them away. However, the vehicles on the road couldn’t avoid the gladiators blocking their way. They intercepted a donkey cart loaded with flour, and the gladiators cheered, “Finally, we can have some delicious bread!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gladiators trained and competed every day, requiring a large amount of food. However, the school needed to make money and couldn’t afford to provide them with good meals. Apart from occasionally being able to eat meat from killing wild animals in the gladiator matches, their main food was cheap and unappetizing barley, which provided high calories but little else. As a result, the gladiators were derogatorily called “barley men”. Despite this, their situation was still better than the poor citizens, who often went hungry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gladiators were overjoyed and spared the driver of a donkey cart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a while, a large wagon approached from the front, but the owner of the wagon sensed trouble and quickly turned the horses around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some gladiators, led by Oenomaus, rushed over and intercepted it. Soon, he excitedly shouted, “Spartacus, come quickly! There are many weapons in this wagon!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus perked up and rushed towards the intercepted wagon with Crixus and the others.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Inside the wagon were numerous weapons such as short swords, long swords, spears, rectangular shields, round shields, helmets, greaves, and even a few fishing nets, but there were no breastplates, as these were all gladiator equipment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus touched the cold shield and excitedly said to the gladiators, “Brothers, our actions have received the blessing of Ares. He has brought us weapons!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gladiators erupted in cheers, with some even shouting, “With weapons, we have nothing to fear! Let’s go back and take down Batiatus!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, someone immediately countered, “Fool, Batiatus has already fled into the city. There is no way we can catch him.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus ignored their argument and turned around and said, “Hamilcar, carefully count how many weapons there are.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Hamilcar could respond, Maximus eagerly said, “Let me do it.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was another opportunity to show his abilities. Seeing Spartacus not objecting, Maximus jumped into the wagon and began to count seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meanwhile, Spartacus approached the driver who quickly begged him for mercy. Spartacus asked in a deep voice, “Tell me, where did you bring these gladiator weapons from? And where were you taking them?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “To… to the arena inside the city,” trembling, the driver replied. “Because the day after tomorrow is the founding day of Capua… the magistrate is hosting a large gladiator competition to celebrate… and they were afraid there wouldn’t be enough weapons… so… I was ordered to transport some from Naples…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus and Crixus exchanged a glance. In fact, their gladiator school had also received an invitation from the city lord’s mansion. It was said that the rewards were quite generous. If it weren’t for this uprising, many of their brothers might have fallen in the arena to satisfy Capua’s bloodthirsty audience.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 6": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 6 – Temple of Flora\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    “I recognize you, the legendary Thraex warrior of the arena! And you, the lion of Gaul! Can’t you spare me? Considering I am your admirer and always cheering for you in the arena? My whole family depends on me for a living!” The driver of the wagon begged again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus was somewhat swayed by his words, but Spartacus calmly said, “Tie him up and take him with us.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus was puzzled, “Spartacus, why make things so complicated? Why not just let him go after leaving all his goods behind, just like earlier?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus’s eyes gleamed as he spoke softly, “If the Capuans don’t know that we’ve seized the wagon carrying gladiatorial weapons and equipment, they will assume that most of us are unarmed. When their defense forces come to pursue us without any precautions…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus’s eyes lit up, and he licked his lips with a crimson tongue, “It seems we don’t need to rush to escape, let’s give them a good beating first!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, Maximus poked his head out from the wagon shed, “Spartacus, there are a total of 60 short swords, 15 long swords, 15 spears, 40 square shields, 40 round shields, 90 helmets, 90 pairs of greaves, and 5 fishing nets…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “That’s a lot of stuff!” Crixus exclaimed excitedly, forgetting to put on a stern face for Maximus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus was somewhat surprised. He knew Maximus could read and write, but he didn’t know that this young man also had good arithmetic skills, being able to quickly tally up all the items in the wagon. It should be noted that most of the gladiators from Thrace or Gaul were illiterate, and the vast majority could only count up to ten using their fingers. Only Hamilcar could be relied upon, but even he couldn’t match Maximus’ speed in calculations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus looked deeply at Maximus and asked, “How far is the temple you mentioned earlier?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus immediately got down from the wagon, surveyed the surroundings, and searched on the previous Maximus’ memories. He then uncertainly replied, “It should be… not far, around more than two kilometers.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Lead us there, we’ll rest there tonight.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ………………………………………………………………………………\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus now deeply regretted bringing the gladiators to the Temple of Flora. Some of them actually assaulted the female priestesses in the temple, including an elderly one, using them as an outlet for their desires and resentment towards the Romans. The pitiful screams of the priestesses felt like a whip, lashing at Maximus’ guilty conscience. He wanted to escape from the uncomfortable temple main hall but was stopped by a gladiator.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Maximus, Crixus said you can’t leave at will. Go back and sleep,” the gladiator crossed his arms and said coldly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the memories of the previous Maximus, he found the name of this person. Torquevado, a Gaul, a veteran among the gladiators, and one of Crixus’ followers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “You guys are doing this, and you still want me to sleep?!” Maximus suppressed the urge to curse and spoke firmly, “I need to see Spartacus. There’s something important I need to tell him, something that concerns the life and death of our brothers! If you don’t let me see him, fine, you’ll be responsible if something happens tomorrow!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Torquevado was taken aback, “You want to see Spartacus?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Yes!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “What’s the matter?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus ignored him and walked back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Wait!” Torquevado stepped aside, warning, “You can only see Spartacus. Don’t wander around!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus ignored him and walked straight out of the main hall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Torquevado followed closely, accompanying him to the apse like escorting a prisoner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The slightly ajar door allowed light to seep through, and as Maximus pushed it open, Spartacus and the others inside immediately focused their attention on him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus swallowed and pretended to be shocked as he said, “Spartacus, please stop those brothers who are violating the priestesses. They are blaspheming the goddess and will be cursed and punished!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “That’s the goddess of the Romans. Punishment doesn’t apply to us Gauls. Our brothers have suffered enough from the Romans, so it’s good to take it out on Roman women,” Crixus said indifferently. He then mocked Maximus, “It seems you’re so protective of those Roman women. No wonder you’re a traitor, raised by Romans!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ignoring Crixus, Maximus looked at Spartacus and said solemnly, “They are not ordinary Roman women. They are respected priestesses. Our actions will only provoke the anger of the Romans, not just the Roman nobles but also the Roman commoners. Soon, the Romans will be hostile towards us everywhere in Italy, and we will find it difficult to move forward!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We are already against the Romans. Whoever dares to stop us, we will kill them. Either we die, or they die, it’s not a big deal,” Oenomaus said in a nonchalant manner, seemingly indifferent to life and death, only seeking to cause a commotion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Oenomaus was a Germanic man, with blonde hair, blue eyes, fair skin, and an exceptionally tall and robust figure like an iron tower. He was the strongest among the gladiators in terms of physical strength, but his sword-fighting skills were weaker than Spartacus and Crixus. However, he had already gained a notorious reputation in the Capuan arena.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Roman commoners are different from Roman nobles, especially the impoverished Roman peasants who wander the streets and can barely survive on free bread. They have lost their land, burdened with large debts, and their living conditions are not much different from ours. They harbor even greater hatred towards the Roman nobles than us. They could very well join us in fighting against the Roman army because only by doing so can they reclaim what they desire,” Maximus explained earnestly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his previous life, he was not a historian but a freelancer who enjoyed taking on projects at home, such as writing and graphic design, while also being a homebody. Playing games was his greatest hobby, followed by watching movies and TV shows online. He lived a lazy life, but when it came to doing things, he was very serious, especially when watching historical biographies or playing war strategy games. He always liked to first understand the historical background, weapons, and equipment, which allowed him to immerse himself more fully. There were quite a few films and TV shows about Spartacus, and although the actual historical records were scarce, Maximus had thoroughly researched the historical context of that time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Nonsense!” Crixus rebuked loudly, feeling that Maximus was just making up reasons to help the priestesses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Spartacus was greatly shocked upon hearing this. He took a few big strides towards Maximus and eagerly asked, “Is what you said true? Will the impoverished peasants help us fight against the Romans?!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus’s extremely excited expression left Maximus stunned:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     Don’t you know about this? In history, this is what you did. That’s why the rebel army you led grew larger and larger like a snowball, eventually becoming a major threat to Rome!\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But then Maximus realized that the ancient hero standing in front of him had grown up in the remote Thracian tribe, later joining the Roman army as an auxiliary troop to fight in Asia Minor, being captured as a deserter, and ultimately becoming a gladiator in Italy. Spartacus, being trapped in the gladiator school, could not possibly have a profound understanding of Roman society, let alone have the foresight and wisdom. Everything he did was just following the historical trend.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this point, Maximus realized another issue: Compared to these gladiators, his own martial prowess was not outstanding, he didn’t know how to lead troops in battle, or how to farm or trade goods. The only thing that set him apart from the others was his far superior knowledge, and the ability to understand the present and foresee the future, which should allow him to establish a firm position in the rebel army and have enough influence!\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 7": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 7 – Destination\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    This gave Maximus great confidence. He said loudly, “As long as we defeat the Roman army a few times, demonstrate our abilities, and make the poor Romans aware of our existence, they, who hate the Roman Senate, will definitely join us. With their help, we can leave Italy and return to our homeland!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Sounds quite beautiful——” Crixus sneered, but Spartacus immediately said to him, “Crixus, go and ask our brothers to release those priestesses and don’t harm them again!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Spartacus, this guy is a traitor. Do you believe his words?!” Crixus stood still and questioned Spartacus while pointing at Maximus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Whether it’s true or not, as long as there’s a glimmer of hope to strengthen our force and resist the Romans, we must give it a try!” Spartacus said firmly. “Besides, I don’t want everyone here to view us as ruthless enemies, just like how we viewed the Romans who burned, killed, and looted in our homeland.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus was slightly moved, but he still refused, “I won’t go. Our brothers are having fun, and I can’t stop them.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus didn’t insist. He turned to the others and said, “Artorix, Oenomaus, you two go and tell our brothers that tomorrow we will head south to raid the Roman farming estates. There will be plenty of beautiful women for them to enjoy. No need to make things difficult for a few poor priestesses.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Alright, Spartacus,” the two said as they left.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus wanted to follow, but Spartacus stopped him, “I remember you told me before that there’s a volcano called Vesuvius to the south of Capua, and there are many large farming estates nearby with lots of slaves. There was even a rebellion a few years ago. Is that true?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Upon hearing this, Maximus felt a stir in his heart. Indeed, there was such information from the memories of the previous Maximus. He answered straightforwardly, “Yes, that’s right. Spartacus, are you planning to take us there?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus nodded and asked, “Do you know how far Mount Vesuvius is from us?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original Maximus had never been to the Vesuvius region and didn’t have the opportunity to access maps. The current information he had was gathered from conversations between the original Maximus’ master and guests during meals. However, Maximus had looked up this information while watching the TV series about Spartacus in his previous life and later delved deeper into the map of Mount Vesuvius while watching the movie\n    <em>\n     Pompeii\n    </em>\n    . The memories were quite vivid. He tried hard to recall and said, “Mount Vesuvius is in the southern part of Campania, not too far from Capua. If we march fast… we should be able to reach it within a day. Uh, is there water?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The last sentence was a bit abrupt, but Hamilcar immediately handed over a pitcher.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Thank you!” Maximus said politely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar smiled kindly at him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar, a Thracian, was slightly old. It was said that he belonged to the same tribe as Spartacus, and they had a close relationship. In the original Maximus’ impression, he was friendly, sociable, and most gladiators had a good impression of him. He had assisted Spartacus in persuading the gladiators to participate in the rebellion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus squatted down, dipped his fingers in the water, and drew the coastline of the Campania region on the stone slab. Then he sketched the approximate location of Capua and Mount Vesuvius. After thinking for a moment, he drew three small circles on the coastline near Mount Vesuvius: “This is Naples mentioned by the driver of the wagon earlier, a large town in the Campania region… These are Pompeii and Herculaneum, both small cities——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus almost blurted out that both Pompeii and Herculaneum would be buried under the surging lava from Mount Vesuvius in a few decades.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone gathered around, focusing on the simple map drawn by Maximus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Crixus, who was very dissatisfied with him, had to admit in his heart:\n    <em>\n     This damn guy is still somewhat useful.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a while, Spartacus looked up at everyone. “Does anyone have objection about going to Mount Vesuvius?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one objected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Then it’s settled,” Spartacus made a decision. “Tomorrow morning, if the Capuan army doesn’t show up, we’ll head south at noon. Hamilcar, have you made arrangements for our brothers on guard duty tonight?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Everything has been arranged.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “You must remind them to stay alert, not to sleep, and to notify everyone immediately if they notice anything unusual! We are now opposing the Romans, so we must not be careless!” Spartacus reminded solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Late at night, the physically and mentally exhausted Maximus entered the land of dreams amidst the sound of snoring from other gladiators, but he had a nightmare.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the dream, the rebel army he was in engaged in a fierce battle with the Roman legions, and despite the intense fighting, the rebel army was ultimately defeated. He was captured by the Romans, nailed to the cross by the road leading to Rome, and died in a miserable and agonizing death…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus woke up from the nightmare, drenched in sweat. He touched the palm of his hand, which had been pierced by iron nails in the dream, and the excruciating pain he felt as if it had really happened…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     This is by no means a dream, this is a historical fact!\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus vividly remembered that in history, the uprising led by Spartacus, although grand in scale, only lasted for less than three years before it met its downfall. Over 6,000 captured rebel soldiers were crucified…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus gasped for breath and instinctively turned his head. The flames of the oil lamp in the hall flickered inconsistently. The once benevolent-looking statue of Flora, in the dim light, appeared somewhat eerie and sinister as it coldly overlooked a group of people sleeping below, with Spartacus presumably in the center.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus gazed at the familiar silhouette, recalling the brief records in history: In fact, the rebel army had a real chance to escape the Roman pursuit and achieve true freedom. At that time, Spartacus led his army north, winning successive battles, and had reached the Po River area, with the towering Alps in sight. If the rebel army crossed the Alps and entered Western Europe inhabited by Gauls and Germanic people, the Romans would have had no power over them. However, Spartacus led the rebel army back south, ultimately leading to their demise… Why did Spartacus suddenly change the marching route and abandon the escape from northern Italy? This has become one of the great mysteries in history, and people have been debating about it for thousands of years…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Would he be able to persuade Spartacus and the others to change their tragic fate? Maximus clenched his fists, determined not to become a lifeless body on a cross!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meanwhile, Spartacus in the hall was not actually asleep. He had spent a long time planning this rebellion, ultimately achieving success. However, he knew deep down that they had only temporarily gained freedom. Italy was the most powerful region under Roman control, and they were swimming in the vast sea of Roman influence. One slight misstep could result in defeat and death…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lives of over two hundred people weighed heavily on Spartacus…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ………………………………………………\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Dolus Vibius, an old Roman citizen. As his name suggests, his family was not a noble. However, his grandfather had a talent for business and seized the opportunity presented by Rome’s continuous expansion in the Mediterranean, accumulating considerable wealth, thus elevating their family to the equestrian class in Rome. His father had served as a financial officer, responsible for the least promising task of managing the treasury and documents, which he did for over a decade without further advancement. Nevertheless, he forged connections with many Roman elites.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his generation, during the dictatorship of Sulla, new laws were enacted: All towns within Italy must be governed by administrative officials appointed by Rome.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 8": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 8 – First Battle\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    Vibius’ father saw this as a good opportunity to build political influence and began to spend a lot of money to lobby for him. Finally, last year, he managed to impress the governor Lucius Licinius Lucullus, who was known as the “heir of the Sulla’s army.” Lucullus signed an executive order, making Vibius, who was just over 30 years old and had only served as an assistant to a legal officer for a few years, the aedile of the city of Capua.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unlike his father, who was content to serve as a common official all his life, Vibius always had his sights set on the Roman Senate. He even wanted to become a consul to elevate his family’s status. That’s why, less than a year into his term, he decided to organize a grand gladiatorial contest on Capua’s founding day to entertain the people and build his own reputation. However, just before the celebration, a major oversight occurred—a group of gladiators actually started a rebellion!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Rome, the Senate would appoint a senator to oversee all gladiator schools, as it was necessary to control activities involving a large number of people training with deadly weapons. However, the system of appointing Roman officials as local town administrators had been in place for less than ten years, and the management system had not been fully established. This led to unclear responsibilities, resulting in lax control over gladiators in Capua.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nevertheless, the ultimate responsibility would fall on Vibius. Angry, he severely whipped Batiatus, who came to report the incident and decided to quickly send troops to eliminate these audacious slaves and quickly quell the unrest, ensuring the smooth progress of the foundation day celebration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The problem was that although Capua had a garrison force, there was no readily available army apart from a few dozen city guards. Vibius could only carry out an emergency military mobilization. However, by the time the troops were assembled and organized, it was already late at night. Despite Vibius’ urging, the citizen soldiers of Capua refused to leave the city at night, forcing Vibius to postpone the military operation until the next day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next day, Vibius hurriedly led the troops out of the city and soon received a report: Those gladiators were still inside the Temple of Flora.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only then did he feel a bit relieved and ordered the troops to slow down their march.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To be honest, he was not satisfied with this army composed of Capuan people. They were already panting and disorganized after just a short march.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He had once been a soldier and had some war experience. It was during Sulla’s invasion of Italy when the populares hastily assembled an army. At less than twenty years old, he was forcibly conscripted and joined the army to confront Sulla outside Rome. The result was a quick defeat, and Vibius hurriedly fled back home. Due to his family’s insignificance in Roman politics, he managed to escape Sulla’s retribution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     The past is not worth looking back on…\n    </em>\n    Vibius sighed in his heart, refocusing his attention on the army he was leading:\n    <em>\n     Although the quality of the soldiers is not great, at least they are well-equipped and numerous. According to that damn Batiatus, most of the gladiators are unarmed and would not be able to withstand this full-scale attack. Now, I have to consider how to report this victory to the Roman Senate to avoid their criticism.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The army began to deviate from the Via Annia and entered a grove of oak trees.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this, Vibius beckoned his aide and asked, “How far is the Temple of Flora?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “It’s just past this oak grove, about half a kilometer away,” the aide replied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vibius cautiously said, “Send the cavalry to scout ahead, make sure those gladiators are still in the temple, and watch out for any ambush!” Though he had limited war experience, he had some common sense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The few cavalrymen hurriedly galloped away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the time they returned at full speed and gave Vibius a satisfactory report, the army had already exited the oak grove. In the distance, a quaint temple sat amidst an apple orchard. It was early April, and the apple trees were in full bloom with white and pink flowers, illuminated by the warm sunlight, creating a particularly beautiful sight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vibius clearly had no interest in the beauty around him; his gaze was fixed on the temple’s entrance: Seven or eight strong men in simple clothing were sitting on the steps, basking in the sun and chatting. Upon seeing the approaching army, they hurriedly stood up and entered the temple.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Form up and prepare to attack!” Vibius exclaimed excitedly, followed by the sound of the bulge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The 500 Capuan citizen soldiers, wearing leather helmets and armor, carrying rectangular shields, spears, and short swords, began to transform from a marching column into a dense formation, advancing slowly towards the temple.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During this process, the doors of the Temple of Flora opened, and the gladiators quickly poured out…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vibius’ eyes widened. Some of the gladiators were wearing equipment similar to the Capuan soldiers, while others were dressed in flashy gladiator gear… far more than a hundred of them were armed with deadly weapons!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     That damn Batiatus dared to lie to me!\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vibius seethed with anger. However, he didn’t panic too much because mounted on his horse, he could see clearly: The gladiators were in a disorganized formation, and at the rear, there were dozens of individuals without any armor, only holding wooden clubs and kitchen knives. They were a ragtag group! With his forces twice the size and well-equipped, they were more than capable of crushing the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Continue to advance steadily!” Vibius ordered coldly, and the bugler sounded the horn rhythmically.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But the Capuan soldiers in the front row were not as eager as before and became somewhat hesitant.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As it turned out, Spartacus, Crixus, Oenomaus, and several other renowned gladiators from the Capuan arena had changed into their usual gladiatorial gear. They stood proudly in the center of the front line. Many Capuan soldiers had witnessed their matches before, and now seeing their imposing appearance, they recalled the terrifying scenes of these gladiators slaughtering their opponents in the arena. Suddenly, fear crept into their hearts, and their legs grew weak.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This was exactly the effect Spartacus wanted. He immediately roared, “BROTHERS, ATTACK!” Taking large strides, he charged towards the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus, Oenomaus, and the other gladiators all roared wildly and charged together, despite being outnumbered and disorganized, their momentum was fierce.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Form the shield wall!” Vibius’ face changed slightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In reality, a round of spear-throwing at this moment could disrupt the gladiators’ charge. However, since the military reforms implemented by Marius decades ago and the introduction of conscription, the citizens of various Italian towns no longer practiced Roman tactics as their ancestors did. Therefore, the Capuan militia did not possess the relatively difficult military skill of spear-throwing.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Vibius felt somewhat relieved as the soldiers promptly raised their shields.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But just then, Spartacus and his group of gladiators, like ferocious tigers, had already charged to the front of the Capuan militia’s formation. Before the opponents could thrust their spears, the gladiators violently rammed the shield wall with their own shields.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In order to improve the gladiators’ chances of victory, the gladiator school provided them with ample food after intense training sessions. As a result, they were all well-fed and robust, easily surpassing the Capuan militia in body size. The untrained Capuan militia were completely powerless to resist the gladiators’ strength. Even with their teammates supporting them from behind, they were still knocked off balance. Taking advantage of the gaps in the shield wall, the gladiators swiftly and accurately stabbed their opponents with their short swords. Amidst the screams, the Capua militia at the front of the formation fell to the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The terrifying killing power of the gladiators shattered Vibius’ preconceived battle plan. As he stood in the rear, he instinctively kept shouting, “Hold your ground! Hold your ground!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, his panic spread to the Capuan soldiers even more. They were already feeling intimidated by these murderous machines, and now, hearing their comrades’ screams, the affluent Capuans had no courage left to fight. They dropped their shields and spears and turned around to flee.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the inevitable defeat, Vibius hastily turned his horse and fled towards the city of Capua.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 9": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 9 – Maximus’ First Battle\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    Early in the morning, the gladiators woke up. Hamilcar brought some people to use the cooking utensils to the backyard of the temple to make barley porridge and bake bread.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meanwhile, Spartacus sent Artorix to disguise himself as a civilian and ride a horse to go out and investigate the situation in the city of Capua. So when Vibius led the army out of the city, Artorix had already reported this news to Spartacus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After breakfast, the fully energized gladiators did not panic despite being outnumbered by the enemy. Instead, they showed a strong desire to fight and began to prepare for the battle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the weapons seized by the gladiators last night were not enough to equip everyone, according to Spartacus’ suggestion, they were first given to the gladiators with strong combat abilities. As a result, Maximus was not chosen and was only given a kitchen knife in the end.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This was not a street brawl but a war confrontation. With the enemy outnumbering them, it was too dangerous to fight with a kitchen knife. So Maximus learned from his companions and broke off a thick and straight branch from an oak tree in the grove, sharpening one end to use it as a spear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though he was in the rear, Maximus still felt nervous when he saw the fully armed enemy approaching. When Spartacus led the charge, he followed his companions in a sprint, but his fear subconsciously slowed his pace.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then he saw Spartacus and the others showing their might, breaking through the front lines of the Capuan formation, and shortly after, the Capuan militia started screaming and retreating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The victory came so quickly that Maximus could hardly believe his eyes. With his confidence soaring, he and his companions chased after the retreating enemies. This was not the time to hold back!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus, tall and long-legged, without armor and a shield, ran swiftly and soon caught up with the fleeing militia.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He thrust his stick forward, but the pointed end of the wooden stick failed to pierce through the enemy’s armor, but it still made the enemy stumble to the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus didn’t pay him any more attention. With a swing of his stick, he fiercely struck another fleeing soldier on the head, causing the person to scream and fall to the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The scream didn’t startle Maximus; instead, it excited him. He chased after a few more steps and struck another fleeing enemy on the head with his stick…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He knocked down three or four in a row. Seeing the other fleeing soldiers getting farther and farther away, he stopped and turned around. He saw his companions already clearing the battlefield. Some were stripping the armor from the dead enemy soldiers, some were finishing off the wounded enemy soldiers, and some were gathering the prisoners who had surrendered voluntarily because they couldn’t escape.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Due to the overly excited pursuit just now, Maximus now felt even more exhausted after stopping his pursuit of the fleeing enemies. He didn’t join in the actions of his companions, but instead sat on the grass, panting heavily…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Yesterday, witnessing his companions killing severely wounded comrades felt cruel, but today, seeing them kill the similarly injured and fallen Capuan militia, Maximus only felt a slight discomfort.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     Am I already getting used to this?\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus looked up, and the warm sunlight filtering through the gaps in the trees, shining on him, was unusually comforting…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as he was lost in thought, a voice sounded beside him:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Maximus, I never thought you could run so fast and take down three of them in one go, kid.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus turned to look, and the speaker was Torquevado, a strong Gallic gladiator. Like most the gladiators, he used to look down on Maximus, but now his face showed a hint of admiration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     It seems my desperate performance earlier was not in vain!\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus extended his right hand, spread out his fingers, and emphasized, “Torquevado, I didn’t bring down just three, but five enemy soldiers! However, if it weren’t for your attacks breaking them down, I wouldn’t have been able to take them down so easily. If you weren’t wearing armor, you could have run faster than me and killed more enemies.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Torquevado was a straightforward man. Upon hearing Maximus’ flattery, he cracked a smile and said, “Don’t worry, this victory has gained us a lot of weapons and armor. Next time, you can fight alongside us with a shield and spear.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Torquevado’s approval dispelled the inexplicable sadness in Maximus’ heart and temporarily made him forget his fatigue. He got up from the ground and was about to say, “Let me help you take off your armor,” when a commotion came from nearby. It turned out that Spartacus and Crixus were having a dispute.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus wanted to kill all the prisoners to intimidate the Romans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus opposed this, believing that all the prisoners should be released. He argued that these cowardly Capuan soldiers would spread the word of their terror, making the Capuans think twice before sending troops to attack them, thus buying them more time. Releasing the prisoners would also make the Capuans less hostile towards them, benefiting their future activities in the Campania region and strengthening their forces…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Spartacus has a point,” Torquevado murmured quietly, having been listening attentively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus looked at him with some surprise. The group of Gallic gladiators had always regarded Crixus as their leader and fully supported him. It was rare to find one who didn’t blindly follow and could think independently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus looked at Spartacus, who was trying to persuade Crixus, and realized that his words from last night must have had some impact on the leader of the gladiators. It was evident that Spartacus was a commander who was not stubborn and could accept the advice of his subordinates. This gave Maximus a bit more confidence in persuading Spartacus to lead the army to escape from Italy in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus’ opinion received support from Hamilcar, Oenomaus, Artorix, and others. As a result, the prisoners were forced to remove their armor, leaving them only with their waistcoats, before being released.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus remained silent with a dark expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus looked at the pile of weapons on the ground and said to Hamilcar, “Go and call Maximus. Let him count our spoils.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus gladly accepted the task and soon finished counting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar reported, “Spartacus, in this battle, we killed 58 people, captured 137 people, and obtained a total of 195 leather armors, 320 leather helmets, 261 short swords, 452 spears, and 500 long shields.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “This is a huge gain. Now all our brothers can have weapons!” Spartacus was excited and then asked, “How many casualties do we have?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Only three people were lightly injured.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus looked at the people around him and said with a smile, “This battle was too easy. The Capuans are really kind. They knew we lacked weapons and specially sent us a batch.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Laughter erupted among the crowd.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus said coldly, “The Capuans are weaklings, everyone knows that. It’s easy to defeat them, but the Romans are not easy to deal with.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “You’re right,” Spartacus restrained his smile and said seriously. “That’s why we must quickly head south to Mount Vesuvius, strengthen our forces as soon as possible, and rely on the terrain of the mountains there to confront the Roman army that may come to attack us at any time. These armor and weapons are hard-won. Let all our brothers wear them. For the remaining ones, Hamilcar, you will be responsible for finding a way to take them all with us, and let Maximus assist you.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Alright.” Hamilcar nodded decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Upon hearing Maximus’ name, this time Crixus merely snorted and didn’t voice any objections. After all, he had witnessed Maximus taking the lead in pursuing and defeating the fleeing soldiers, as well as his performance from last night, which had somewhat changed his negative impression of him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After receiving the notice from Hamilcar, Maximus’ first thought that came to mind was:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     So they want me to handle logistics support, does that mean I don’t have to go to the front lines and fight anymore?\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So he readily agreed and asked, “What should I do now?”\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 10": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 10 – Marching Along the Way\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    “Let’s go and get the wagon ready,” Hamilcar said, then turned and walked towards the temple. Maximus followed closely behind. They arrived at the courtyard behind the temple, where two horses and a donkey were tied up, happily munching on barley brought by the gladiators from the gladiator school.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The two led the horses to the carriage and put on their bridles, connecting them to the yoke…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The original Maximus had learned knowledge from his young master since he was a child, and as a slave, he had also done these tasks before, so he quickly got the hang of it. Then he put the donkey in front of the cart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar threw bags of flour out of the cart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Why are you throwing away such good flour?” Maximus couldn’t adapt to the gladiators’ usual food, barley porridge. So when he saw Hamilcar throwing away the flour, he was quite puzzled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We need to make space to carry those weapons. We can always go and steal flour from farms, but we can’t just steal those weapons whenever we want,” Hamilcar replied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus thought it made sense, but he also felt it was a pity. After thinking for a moment, he said, “Why don’t we give this flour to the priestesses of the temple? It can be considered as our compensation.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar didn’t say anything, which was taken as affirmation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But when Maximus faced the red and swollen eyes of the priestesses in the temple, filled with hidden resentment, he felt ashamed and hurriedly finished speaking before turning and running away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the two of them drove the wagon and donkey cart to the front of the temple, the leather armor piled on the ground had already been distributed. It was evident that Spartacus’s arithmetic skills were not very good, as the obtained weapons and armor were far from enough to equip all the gladiators. Maximus, however, was actually quite relieved about this fact.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gladiators also disliked the fancy, heavy, and obstructive gladiator helmets, and all switched to leather helmets. At first glance, they looked just like a Capuan city guard unit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But they disliked the heavy shields and were unwilling to carry them. Over five hundred shields were piled on the ground, forming a small mountain, which made Hamilcar furrow his brow, as the two vehicles could not fit so many things. So he immediately brought this matter to Spartacus’ attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus had to ask everyone to carry at least two shields and a spear each. In order to appease everyone’s complaints, he also promised to intercept more wagons as soon as possible to carry everyone’s weapons, making it easier for everyone to march south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When everything was arranged and they were ready to depart, a piece of bad news affected everyone’s cheerful mood: Among the injured resting in the temple, one person had a festering chest wound, causing an unrelenting high fever, and the person had fallen into a coma.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus had no choice but to issue the order to “send him off peacefully.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This time Maximus witnessed with his own eyes the process of the wounded man being stabbed in the chest and then buried in a pit. His mood remained calm, and he even felt relieved that the deceased was not Phaselus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the previous battle occurred early and ended quickly, by the time the gladiators passed through the apple orchard and returned to the Via Annia, it was still not noon.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Via Annia was a major road in Rome that led to Regium, the southernmost part of Italy. It was frequented by pedestrians and vehicles every day. Although the news of Capua’s disastrous defeat had caused nearby pedestrians to avoid the area, it didn’t take long for new, unaware pedestrians and vehicles to restore its liveliness. When the gladiators walked on the center of the main road, these people mistook them for their own army. As a result, four wagons were quickly seized by the gladiators.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gladiators threw away the contents of the wagons, placed their shields and spears inside, and even made space for their injured comrades to sit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gladiators were not concerned about the lack of enough wagon drivers, because Gauls were good charioteers, after all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus also exchanged the donkey cart he was driving for a wagon, and with the help of the previous Maximus’ muscle memory, he familiarized himself with the skills of driving a horse-drawn carriage again. Additionally, there was an injured Gaul gladiator sitting in his wagon to provide technical guidance whenever he needed it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After this looting, pedestrians and merchants finally realized that these “soldiers” were not friendly and scattered away in all directions. The gladiators had no intention of chasing them, and the empty road was more advantageous for their march.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it was called a march, it was more like a leisurely stroll. Despite being equipped with the armor of the city guard, they had no concept of marching in formation. Over 200 people followed behind Spartacus, Crixus, and Oenomaus, chatting, joking, and playing around, just like ordinary pedestrians, moving southward in a relaxed and leisurely manner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The disorderly scene made Maximus, sitting in the wagon, a bit uneasy. He understood that these gladiators from Gaul, Thrace, Illyria, or other places had battlefield experience before becoming gladiators, and their individual combat capabilities were terrifying after years of training in the gladiator school, as evidenced by the previous battle. However, could they still unleash their power with their free-spirited and adept at solo combat nature against the disciplined and coordinated Roman legions?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though Maximus had never served in the military in his previous life, he could confidently give a negative answer. Therefore, to avoid being bothered, he turned his gaze to the sides of the road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Campania truly lived up to its reputation as a famous plain in Italy. The wheat fields stretched endlessly. Just a month after the spring equinox, the green wheat shoots were already higher than calves. Under the gentle breeze, layers of wheat waves rose and fell, resembling a vast green ocean. Occasionally, people could be seen weeding and tending the fields within this sea.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Based on the memories of the previous Maximus, the farmers wearing short shirts in the scorching hot weather at noon were probably the owners of the farmland, while those bare-chested, dark-skinned individuals were likely slaves. However, it seemed that the owners rarely bossed them around and often worked in the fields themselves, cooperating seamlessly with the slaves. They even laughed and joked together, creating a harmonious atmosphere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This made Maximus doubt the knowledge he had about Rome from his past life:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     Shouldn’t slaves and slave owners be hostile towards each other in a slave society?\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Determined to find out the truth, Maximus decided to continue observing carefully.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ………………………………………………….\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Along the Via Annia south of Capua, there were towns like Calatia, Suessula, and Nola. These towns used to be small cities occupied by the Samnites. They used these strongholds to attack the Greek colonial towns along the coast to the west, which attracted the attention of the Romans. The Samnites were eventually defeated and became part of the Roman alliance, but they did not fully submit and occasionally caused trouble.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When Hannibal invaded Italy, many Samnite tribes joined him. During the\n    <em>\n     Roman Social War\n    </em>\n    , they were one of the main forces of rebellion. And over a decade ago, when Sulla led his army to attack Rome, many Samnites actively responded to the recruitment of the populares and fought against Sulla’s forces outside the walls of Rome. After their defeat, they were all taken prisoner.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Sulla was extremely angry with the Samnites. He believed that as long as the Samnites existed as an independent people, there would be no peace for the Romans. Therefore, he not only massacred nearly ten thousand Samnite prisoners of war but also pursued any important Samnite figures with even the slightest connection to the populares. During his dictatorship, he also enacted a series of measures to strictly govern the Samnite towns, such as prohibiting the construction or repair of city walls without Roman officials and forbidding the establishment of city defense forces.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ten years later, these Samnite towns in the Campania plain gradually transformed into villages, and some of them had even disappeared. The fierce spirit of the Samnites in the plain had almost been extinguished. Although they clearly recognized that the gladiators marching arrogantly on the road as a band of thieves, they simply gathered together and watched from a distance, without any intention of attacking the caravan trailing behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After passing through Nola, according to the memories of the previous inhabitant of his current body, Maximus went to inform Spartacus: They couldn’t continue southward anymore. They had to leave the main road and turn west.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 11": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 11 – Raiding the Farm\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    Actually, without Maximus’s reminder, everyone had already seen the towering cone-shaped mountain rising from the plain to the south. The upper half of the mountain was dark and obscure, while the lower half was lush and green, with faint smoke lingering at the mountain top…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone stared blankly at this renowned and peculiar mountain in Italy. Even the courageous Crixus couldn’t help but swallow nervously and ask, “Is that Mount Vesuvius?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Yes,” Spartacus responded softly, as if afraid of disturbing something. “Our destination is there—The Forge of Hephaestus.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Mount Vesuvius was visible, it was still a considerable distance away, and it was already dusk. The gladiators didn’t want to travel at night, so when they saw a nearby farm, they rushed towards it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The farm had a moderately sized courtyard, surrounded by a dense arrangement of wooden slats and low shrubs, forming a crisscrossing fence. It was merely meant to mark the boundaries and prevent strangers from trespassing, but it couldn’t obstruct the fierce and menacing gladiators. They charged through the fence, pushed open the wooden gate, and frightened the seven or eight people huddled in the courtyard, causing them to tremble. However, instead of scattering and fleeing, they shielded a young man in their midst.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One daring old man mustered his courage and questioned, “W-Who are you?! How dare you… intrude on Lord Dionysius’ territory!” His words were greeted with even louder barking from the farm dogs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without hesitation, Crixus stepped forward and delivered a kick. The farm dog let out a cry, flew through the air, and crashed into the wall. When it landed on the ground, its legs twitched, further terrifying the people in the courtyard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus looked at them and asked with a hint of interest, “Who is Dionysius? Judging by the name, it sounds like a Greek.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The young man, as if humiliated, trembled as he spoke, “M-My father is a Roman citizen, an important senator from Naples. He has enough money to pay a ransom for me, but if… if you dare to harm me, he will make Naples send out its army—”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Can Naples’ army be stronger than Capua’s?” Crixus sneered, provoking laughter from the gladiators.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus, however, said seriously, “We are not bandits. We are a group of fighters declaring war on Rome and fighting for freedom!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Despite the young man’s desperate attempt to conceal it, his eyes looked at Spartacus as if he were a joke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus paid no attention and looked at the others. “Are you all slaves?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man, forgetting his fear, proudly said, “I am a Roman citizen!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I… I am a free man,” two people responded in unison.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The remaining four hesitated and nodded, admitting that they were slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Are you willing to join us?” Spartacus looked at them and spoke in a gentle tone, “This way, you will have your freedom and no longer have to worry about being oppressed.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The four slaves looked at each other, then lowered their heads, none of them responded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Don’t dream. They are all… my family,” the young man couldn’t help but speak, but Crixus punched him in the face, causing him to fall backwards with blood streaming from his nose.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Shut up, you little brat, or I’ll end your life!” Crixus threatened fiercely, then turned to the slaves, “If you don’t speak up, I’ll chop you up and feed you to the dogs!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The slaves trembled in fear, but still shook their heads in refusal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus, enraged, drew his short sword and made two threatening slashes in front of the slaves, “You ungrateful fools, what use is there in keeping you alive?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Terrified, the slaves immediately knelt down, begging for mercy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Crixus, that’s enough,” Spartacus’ face also turned grim, but he suppressed his anger and said in a deep voice, “Our brothers have worked hard all day, tired and hungry. Hamilcar and Maximus, take these people to prepare food. If anyone disobeys, you can deal with them as you see fit.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus then looked at the young man on the ground and continued, “Artorix, take this guy inside the house, we need to have a good talk with him.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Artorix approached and grabbed the terrified young man as if he were a little chicken.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Wh-what are you going to do?” The old man stepped forward, wanting to stop Artorix, but he was pushed aside and fell to the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He quickly got up and kowtowed repeatedly, “Please, spare my young master! I beg you——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Just come with me and work. If you do well, we will consider sparing your young master,” Hamilcar said coldly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man saw a glimmer of hope and quickly stood up, trying to please them. “Please, give me your orders. We will do our best!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “How many sheep do you have?” Hamilcar looked towards one side of the farm, despite the noise from the gladiators entering the yard, the sound of sheep bleating could still be heard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Forty-five,” the old man replied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Who among you is skilled at slaughtering sheep?” Hamilcar asked again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man pointed to two people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Go and slaughter twenty, then chop them up for stew.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Twenty?” the old man seemed reluctant, “These are valuable Attica sheep, known for their fine wool——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Do you want me to slaughter all your sheep?” Hamilcar glared at him, and the old man became too scared to say anything.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar ordered several gladiators to take the two slaves to the sheep pen behind the farm to slaughter sheep. Then he said to Maximus, “Normally, one fat sheep is barely enough for eight people to eat. We gladiators have big appetites, and today’s consumption is high. It seems that three or four people can eat one sheep. These 20 sheep won’t be enough for them, but they haven’t had meat in a long time. If we let them eat too much at once, it will make them uncomfortable. So, we need to be moderate. Stewing the meat into soup would be best.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus listened attentively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Who among you is the cook?” Hamilcar questioned again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “…The cook is inside,” the old man hesitated and pointed to the location of the kitchen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Haha, so there’s a woman hiding in there!” Some gladiators were delighted and rushed inside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus shouted, “Stop right there! Are you a bunch of donkeys who have never seen a woman before? If you ruin the cook, who will cook for you?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus usually treated other gladiators kindly, but when he got angry, he was quite intimidating. The gladiators not only stopped in their tracks but also dared not meet his gaze or argue with him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Endure for now,” Spartacus softened his tone and smiled, saying, “Once we settle down and open up the situation, we can find any kind of woman. Why bother with the cook, who looks tougher than a man!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Laughter erupted in the courtyard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar quickly led the others to the kitchen, asking as they walked, “Is there ready-made flour here?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Yes,” the old man replied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Is there enough for each of us to have two large round loaves of bread?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man surveyed the gladiators crowding the courtyard and nodded, “…It should be enough, but with so many of you, it will take quite some time to make.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “No rush, take your time. We have plenty of time.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar’s words made the old man uneasy:\n    <em>\n     It seems that these thieves won’t leave here tonight.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Inside the kitchen, two cooks, who didn’t look as terrible as Spartacus had described, were hiding. However, they weren’t attractive either. They were the wives of the two free men, who were promised by Hamilcar that their lives and the lives of their husbands would be spared if they prepared a good dinner. With trembling hearts, they began boiling water, making porridge, washing vegetables, and cooking fish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rest of the group, under the old man’s guidance, split their tasks. Some were responsible for chopping firewood and starting a fire, while others kneaded dough, let it ferment, and baked bread.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar walked back and forth in the small kitchen, solemnly supervising their work. It seemed that he had done the same thing in the kitchen of the Temple of Flora earlier in the morning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus stood at the kitchen door, silently watching Hamilcar’s well-organized arrangements.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 12": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 12 – About Sl*very\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    When the food was almost ready, Hamilcar did not immediately bring it out. Instead, he had Maximus call in some of the most respected gladiators, such as Artorix, Oenomaus, and Torquevado to have them carry the food out and distribute it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “If we bring the food out ourselves, our hungry brothers will surely rush in, and cause chaos. But if Oenomaus and the others do it, our brothers won’t dare to snatch. In the legion, it’s usually a centurion leading the slaves to distribute food to the soldiers. We’ve just escaped, and we haven’t established any rules yet. It will get better in the future,” Hamilcar patiently explained to Maximus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus couldn’t help but ask, “I’ve heard Spartacus say before that you were once in the Roman army?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar fell silent for a moment and said in a low voice, “That’s right. We were recruited because we coveted Roman wealth, but it ended up causing the destruction of our entire tribe.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing Hamilcar’s cold voice, Maximus felt a chill down his spine. He didn’t dare to ask further and instead inquired, “According to the standards of the Roman army, how many people would it take to prepare a meal for a group like ours?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar thought for a moment and said, “Each contubernium of ten men in a Roman legion includes two slave soldiers who usually handle miscellaneous tasks and are primarily responsible for food preparation. We have about 250 people, so according to their requirements, we would need 50 people to prepare a meal. But the Roman legion has a high standard, so for us, 20 people cooking would be enough.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He looked at Maximus with satisfaction and said, “I’m glad you asked such a question. It shows that you are seriously considering our food situation, unlike those guys this morning. I asked them to help, but they were all very reluctant. Besides killing, they don’t know anything else. You’re quite remarkable!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus modestly replied, “I just think that no matter how brave we are, if we can’t eat enough, we won’t have the strength to defeat the enemy.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “You’re right. An army’s food supply is very important! The Romans are indeed detestable, but their dedication to this aspect is unmatched by other forces.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar sighed. It was rare for someone to listen to him talk about these things, which piqued his interest. He immediately pulled Maximus to sit near the kitchen door. He had the slaves scoop two bowls of lamb soup and tore a large piece of hot bread. As they ate, he continued, “I just gave a rough estimate earlier. In reality, the number of people needed to cook for a legion depends on the actual situation. If there’s no danger around, and the kitchen and food are readily available, just like we are now, ten people can satisfy the needs of over 200 people because we have enough time to prepare slowly. But if we are on the march or in enemy territory, the situation would be very different…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus listened attentively to Hamilcar’s explanation and gained a better understanding of logistical supply. Hamilcar shared insights such as why transporting grain was preferred over ready-made flour for the army, as it was easier to preserve. This was also the reason why the slave soldiers of the Roman army often had to carry hand mills.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Though Hamilcar was usually reserved and spoke sparingly, Maximus’ inquiries struck a chord with him. Once he started talking, he couldn’t stop until a gladiator came to call him, “Spartacus wants to discuss something with you.” Reluctantly, he stood up and said to Maximus, “Maximus, I’ll leave things here to you. Is that alright?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “No problem,” Maximus responded readily. After Hamilcar left, Maximus turned to the people in the kitchen. They had been working continuously for over three hours, sweating profusely. Artorix and the others had stopped coming to the kitchen to demand food, indicating that the gladiators were almost full.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Take a break, have some food to regain your strength,” Maximus said. As soon as he finished speaking, the people in the kitchen dropped their cooking utensils and started eating bread.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After they had eaten, their hunger had subsided, and they were no longer wolfing down their food, Maximus approached one of the slaves. Based on his previous observations, this person had been working the hardest. “Why were you unwilling to join us?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The slave looked up, somewhat bewildered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “You’re a slave, ordered around by your master to work hard like an ox or a sheep every day. If you join us, not only will no one dare to order you around, but you’ll have lamb soup and bread to eat every day. It’s so much better to live freely. Why wouldn’t you want that?” Maximus asked, full of puzzlement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The slave lowered his head and mumbled after a while, “…I don’t want to be crucified by the Romans.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus didn’t get angry. He turned to another slave, who was the most glib at work and had been warned by Hamilcar a few times. “And what about you?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Well…” The slave’s eyes darted around, and he replied, “My master treats me well. I don’t feel like a slave. Why should I leave?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus was half skeptical of his words.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that moment, the old man looked at Maximus earnestly and said, “I was once a slave too. I was raised in the house of Dionysius since I was a child, and my master treated me like family. After the civil war decades ago, the Romans recognized the entire population of Italy as Roman citizens. Roman laws also applied to all Italian towns, including Naples. So, my master paid for my freedom out of his own pocket, and after a few more years when I met the requirements, he applied to the municipal office to make me a Roman citizen——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this point, the old man straightened his chest and said, “After that, my master also appointed me as the overseer of this farm, with a decent monthly salary. Since then I got married, had children, and even grandchildren. And those two over there——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man pointed to the two freedmen, “They were also slaves before, but with the master’s permission, they gained their freedom three years ago. And for the rest of you, don’t worry, work hard, and you will be like me in the future.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Upon hearing the old man’s words, the deepest memory of the original Maximus was also stirred up. He realized that Roman law indeed had provisions that allowed slaves to gain their freedom and become Roman citizens. However, without the master’s permission, it was impossible for a slave to accumulate enough money to buy their own freedom. Nevertheless, the Romans seemed more tolerant and generous in this regard, and an important reason behind this was the ancient tradition of patronage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Patrons provided political and life protection to their clients, while clients offered political support and military assistance to their patrons. It was not a relationship of complete dependence but rather mutual support and progress. The Romans adhered to this established tradition, and no one dared to disrupt it, ensuring relative stability in society. When a slave became a citizen, a deeper patronage relationship naturally formed with their former master. Since the Roman civil war several decades ago, all Italians became Roman citizens, and this special tradition of Rome spread throughout Italy, including Naples.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason why Maximus’ former master was willing to spend money and effort to cultivate him, a lowly household slave, stemmed from the same idea. Unfortunately, his former master’s entire family was killed, leading to Maximus’ current predicament. If all the slaves in Italy were treated like the slaves on this farm, with minimal abuse, social mobility, and hopeful prospects for the future, would they be willing to stay rather than rise up in rebellion?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking about this, Maximus felt uneasy. Would Spartacus still be able to lead a major slave uprising?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Countless thoughts churned in Maximus’ mind, and his expression changed constantly. The old man, seeing this, mistakenly believed that it was because Maximus was angered by his dissuasion of the slaves from joining their cause. He quickly added, “Actually, the reason our master takes care of us like this is because there’s a shortage of labor here. He even often asks the young master to come here and help with the work, so every person is important. But those large farming estates are different. They have vast cultivated lands and many slaves, many of whom are newcomers. The owners of those large farms employ multiple overseers and even guards. They use whips and clubs every day to coerce the slaves into working obediently. A few years ago, it even led to riots…”\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 13": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 13 – Settling in Vesuvius\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    Maximus was intrigued, “Are these large farms you mentioned in the Mount Vesuvius area?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “That’s right, right there!” The old man emphasized, speaking with certainty. “Those large farms occupy thousands of jugers\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#gem-novels-note-1\" id=\"gem-novels-note-link-1\">\n      [1]\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    of extremely fertile land, with hundreds or even thousands of slaves, countless grains and livestock, and even some beautiful female slaves——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Hey!” Maximus interrupted him, bluntly saying, “Old man, are you trying to incite us to rob those large farms?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “N-no, I just wanted to tell you the truth,” the old man denied, shaking his head.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus sneered. The old man’s words triggered a memory of the previous Maximus, “Facing competition from these large farms, can this farm sell its wheat and wool? How much money will it cost to sell them?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man fell silent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there were no large farms around Capua, the surrounding markets were mostly flooded with agricultural products produced by these large farming estates. According to the memory of the previous Maximus, most of the owners of these large farms were Roman patricians who took advantage of the fertile soil of Mount Vesuvius and the abundance of cheap slaves to cultivate better wheat, grapes, and olives….. They sold these agricultural products at the same or even lower prices, naturally attracting the masses. Even the owner of this smaller farm, who owned several hundred jugers of land, often lamented about not being able to sell their own produce. It seemed that the owner of this farm was probably not doing well, let alone the common people…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, Maximus regained his composure and said to the people in the kitchen, “Have you all eaten? Then continue working and bake another three hundred loaves of bread.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ………………………………………………\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next morning, after having porridge and bread, the gladiators released the people from the farm and prepared to continue their journey south.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After interrogating the young man and learning about the surrounding situation the previous night, Spartacus requested that the gladiators be fully armed as they moved forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar and Maximus exchanged the donkey cart for a farm wagon, increasing the number of wagons in the convoy to six, and providing ample space for carrying weapons, food, and wounded soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As an intermittently erupting active volcano, Mount Vesuvius had a vast coverage of volcanic ash, spanning over 150 square kilometers. Therefore, not long after leaving the farm, the gladiator’s group entered the Vesuvius area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Along the way, besides the thriving wheat fields, there were also many vineyards. The number of farmers working in the fields had noticeably increased. Occasionally, overseers wielding whips and wearing long robes could be seen shouting loudly, while shackled and battered slaves trembled in fear.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gladiators were eager to act, but Spartacus and Crixus did their best to restrain them. After all, their primary task now was to reach the foothills of Mount Vesuvius and find a place to settle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, trouble found them despite Spartacus’ intention to avoid it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The free-spirited gladiators walked through the fields, inevitably trampling on the wheat seedlings. When an overseer from a large farm noticed this, he immediately brought the farm guards and aggressively approached the group to confront them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It appeared that news of Spartacus leading the gladiators in a rebellion hadn’t spread to this area yet. These people mistook the gladiators as city guards and arrogantly claimed that the owner of this farm was a certain senator of Rome. They demanded compensation from the gladiators, threatening that their master would make them regret it otherwise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gladiators burst into laughter, they drew their short swords and cut them down one by one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other overseers and guards realized the danger and fled in fear. Many slaves also tried to escape, but with their shackles, they couldn’t run fast. Some slaves remained in place, observing curiously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We are gladiators rebelling against Roman oppression. Do you want to join us, fight against the Romans, and seek freedom together?!” Spartacus exclaimed loudly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After some hesitation, the observing slaves stumbled over, dragging their shackles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The leader among them spoke in broken Latin, saying loudly, “We… come from Iberia… the Celtic people in the mountains… the Romans captured our tribes… and took us captive here…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Welcome to join us! As long as we defeat the Romans, we will find a way to get everyone back home!” Spartacus smiled and made a promise. Compared to the few slaves in the previous farm who declined to join the group last night, he felt relieved by the smooth inclusion of these Celts today. It seemed that his decision to come to Vesuvius for recruitment was the right one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gladiators even caught up with the farm overseer, cut him down, and took the keys to help the slaves unlock their shackles. The slaves cheered with excitement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus, who was driving a wagon, also heard the slaves’ words. It sparked something in his mind: In his previous life, when he had researched the history of the Spartacus uprising, he vaguely remembered that at this time, Rome was engaged in two wars, one in Asia Minor and the other in Iberia. That “Pompey the Great” should be in Hispania!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The addition of the slaves did not change the gladiators’ route. As the group advanced, the terrain became uneven, gradually rising towards Mount Vesuvius. They had entered the foothills of Vesuvius, where wheat fields were replaced by vineyards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The volcanic ash soil, weathered over time, was particularly suitable for growing grapes. The Falernian, Statanian, and Calenian wines produced from these vineyards were considered the best in all of Italy. The Romans would undoubtedly make good use of every piece of land here. While there were no wheat fields, there were plenty of slaves, even more than before. Taking care of grapevines requires more precision than cultivating wheat seedlings. Besides tilling the soil, fertilizing, and watering, the main tasks involved pruning and training the vines and constructing trellises. Some female slaves could also be seen working in the vineyards.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Killing overseers and inviting slaves to join them became a routine for the gladiators as they marched. By the afternoon, when the group stopped moving, the number of joined slaves had reached 150. One-third of them were from Iberia, one-third from Asia Minor, and one-third from northern Greece. These were newly enslaved individuals who had been here for less than three years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus, Crixus, and the other leaders’ main task along the way was to observe the terrain and find a suitable place to settle. Eventually, they unanimously chose a large farm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was situated on a gentle mountainside, with the terrain behind it gradually steepened, forming a protective barrier for the estate, with only a small road leading up to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether it was Spartacus from Thrace or Crixus from Gaul, they were both mountain people. Given the constant threat of Roman military action, living in the mountains made them feel safer. Therefore, capturing this large farm and establishing their base here became the unanimous decision of the leaders.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The farm was surrounded by a wall over two meters high, and there were several guards inside. As soon as they sensed danger, they closed the wooden gate and assumed a defensive posture. The person in charge even climbed up the wall, warning the approaching gladiators to leave immediately, or else they would face the wrath of the Roman senator.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus ignored the warning and ordered an attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the farm had walls, there were fig trees planted outside the walls with grapevines climbing on them, forming what was called “grape trees.” This was another way of trellising grapes. The gladiators easily climbed the walls using the fig trees and entered the estate. They swiftly overpowered the guards and overseers who dared to resist, and soon the entire estate was under their control.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <div class=\"tl-notes mt-5\">\n     <b>\n      Translator's Notes:\n     </b>\n     <ol>\n     </ol>\n    </div>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <li id=\"gem-novels-note-1\">\n     A Roman unit of measurement of area.\n     <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugerum\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\n      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugerum\n     </a>\n     <a href=\"#gem-novels-note-link-1\">\n      ↩︎\n     </a>\n    </li>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 14": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 14 – Initial Establishment of Teams\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar, accompanied by Maximus, entered the farm, and the task given to them by Spartacus was to count the supplies in it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The farm was not small in size, but compared to the one they stayed in last night, it had fewer buildings. There were no manure piles near the farm, no granary in the yard, no pigsty, sheep pen, or even a stable, so there was no obvious smell.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the middle of the yard was a flat stone ground, not for threshing, but for drying raisins. In the middle of the ground was a pool used to collect rainwater. On one side of the yard were two wine-making rooms with presses and various sizes of barrels inside. On the other side were multiple wine cellars, some storing large wine barrels, and others storing wooden barrels… The entire farm had only one relatively small warehouse, storing flour and barley, as well as a small amount of smoked meat. It was evident that this was a farm specifically for producing wine.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally, the two entered the only residential building in the farm. The ground floor was for the slaves to live in, with small and cramped rooms, while the top floor was where the overseers and guards lived, spacious and comfortable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Walking into the largest room, Maximus noticed a piece of papyrus on the wooden table, with an opened envelope next to it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He walked over, picked it up, and read the Latin letters written on it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “What does it say?” Hamilcar, who couldn’t read, curiously asked\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After reading it, Maximus thought for a moment and said in a deep voice, “The man just now didn’t lie. This farm does indeed belong to a Roman senator. He wrote a letter to inform the steward here that the price of Roman wine had risen and demanded the immediate delivery of twenty barrels of wine to Rome. There’s his signature on the letter.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus pronounced each word slowly, “Marcus. Porcius. Cato.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar casually asked, “Who is this person?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I’m not entirely sure either, but I vaguely remember my former master mentioning him. This family called Cato has a lot of influence in Rome!” Maximus said solemnly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, he knew nothing about the person who wrote the letter. However, he was familiar with the Cato family, because in his previous life’s history, two members of this family left a deep impression on him:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Cato family was originally Roman plebeian, and the\n    <em>\n     Cato the Elder\n    </em>\n    rose to prominence during the war against Hannibal. He often shouted in the Senate, “Carthage must be destroyed,” which eventually led to the downfall of Carthage by Rome. There was also\n    <em>\n     Cato the Younger\n    </em>\n    who consistently opposed Caesar… This family seemed to have a trait that once they set their sights on a goal, not even a nine-headed cow could pull them back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We must tell Spartacus about this!” Hamilcar’s expression turned serious as he turned to leave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus was about to follow when he caught sight of a stack of papyrus on the bed. He immediately walked over and picked it up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “What’s this now?” Hamilcar stopped in his tracks and asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus glanced at the first page and said, “It seems to be a book teaching people how to cultivate crops and raise cattle and sheep.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Oh…” Hamilcar lost interest and left the room.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Maximus carefully searched the entire bed, picking up several scattered pages, neatly stacking them, and carefully putting them into his arm before leaving the room.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the gladiators eliminated the resistance, they gathered all the slaves from the farm together. Spartacus not only invited them to join their cause, but at the same time, he generously declared, “If anyone is unwilling to join, they are free to leave. We will not harm them.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a result, nearly 30 slaves chose to stay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While everyone was resting in the courtyard of the farm, Spartacus, Crixus, and a few other leaders were already sitting in the room where they found the letter, discussing the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing the situation described by Hamirlcar and Maximus, Spartacus spoke with a serious expression, “Brothers, although we have temporarily found a foothold and gained more slaves joining our ranks, the Romans will soon learn that we have taken over their farm and taken their slaves. They will likely send troops soon. Should we stay here and fight them or rest for a few days before continuing south?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Of course, we should stay here and fight the Romans!” Crixus decisively exclaimed, “We have only been here for half a day, and the number of people joining our ranks is close to 200! There are slaves everywhere here. If we launch a full-scale attack, killing the Roman overseers and inviting the slaves to join us, it won’t take long for our numbers to reach thousands! Moreover, there are many farms here, storing an ample amount of food. We don’t have to worry about going hungry! If we abandon such a good place and choose to run south, that would be a foolish decision!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Crixus is right. Since we have already decided to resist the Romans and will inevitably have to fight their army, the sooner we achieve victory, the sooner we can establish our reputation and attract more people to join us. That’s when we won’t fear the Romans anymore!” Artorix, who was usually cautious, now had a fiery gleam in his eyes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Us Germanic people have never feared battle with Rome!” Oenomaus expressed his determination concisely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus glanced at Hamilcar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar nodded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Good! Since we are all in agreement, then we shall face the Romans here!” Spartacus’ face was filled with enthusiasm. He looked around at everyone and spoke in a deep voice, “However, the Roman legion is not like the soldiers in Capua. They are well-organized and disciplined. I once served as an auxiliary for the Roman legion in Asia Minor, and I can attest to this. If we want to fight the Romans, we can no longer engage in random battles like before. We must organize our brothers well, strengthen our training, and maximize our strength. So, I have a suggestion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Our army now exceeds 400 people. Crixus, Artorix, Oenomaus, and I will each command a hundred men. Each hundred-man unit (centuria) will consist of half veteran brothers and half newly recruited slaves. This way, the new recruits will not perform poorly under the guidance of our veteran brothers. Additionally, we will elect one squad leader for every ten people, which will bring more order to the entire army and prevent chaos during battles. What do you think?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Spartacus’s suggestion is right. This way, we won’t be disorganized in battle,” Artorix was the first to express agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Let’s do it,” Oenomaus replied straightforwardly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only Crixus hesitated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus understood his thoughts and persuaded, “Crixus, our veteran brothers are limited, but the number of people joining the team will increase. In the future, our veteran brothers may become centurions or even commanders, leading troops to fight against the Romans. If you overly protect them and prevent them from gaining experience, they may blame you in the future.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus’ heart trembled slightly: Among the gladiators, there were more than a hundred Gauls, and he had always considered himself their leader, unwilling to let others interfere. But Spartacus was right. If these proud individuals saw gladiators inferior to them becoming captains, leading seven or eight slaves, while they themselves remained as subordinate soldiers, their dissatisfaction would quickly erupt…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Thinking of this, Crixus finally nodded, “I have no objections.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus smiled, “Good, we will proceed accordingly. You will be the first to select a hundred men.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus readily agreed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus continued, “We also need to establish a cavalry unit to scout the surrounding area, especially the movements of the Roman army. What do you think?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I agree.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “How many people should be in this cavalry unit?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Let’s start with five for now.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “But all the horses we have are used to pull wagons, and there are no extras,” reminded Hamilcar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “There are plenty of farms around here, so we won’t lack horses. If we capture more horses, we’ll allocate them to the cavalry unit first,” suggested Spartacus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone agreed.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 15": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 15 – Maximus’ New Position\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    “As for the captain of the cavalry unit…” Spartacus pondered for a moment, then looked at Artorix. “The gladiator who accompanied you on the reconnaissance mission and was the first to notice the movement of the Capuan army and promptly informed us… his name is…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “O… Omarkel,” Artorix interjected. “He’s quite clever and skilled in horsemanship.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I suggest he take command of the cavalry unit,” Spartacus said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus hesitated. Although Omarkel was a Gaul, he was one of the few who didn’t always obey him. But he didn’t want to appear envious, so he reluctantly said, “I… have no objections.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus continued, “We have acquired a considerable amount of supply already, and we will gain even more spoils in the future. To avoid conflicts and chaos caused by everyone scrambling for them, we must manage the spoils properly. Additionally, our numbers are increasing, and ensuring everyone is well-fed is no easy task. We need to establish a logistical unit responsible for managing supplies and providing ample food for everyone. I suggest that Hamilcar take on the role of the logistics team leader, with Maximus as his assistant, overseeing a temporary team of twenty people. What do you all think?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone unanimously agreed. The gladiators were enthusiastic about fighting and killing, but they had little knowledge of logistics and supply. They were eager for someone to handle these complicated matters. Therefore, Crixus only glanced at Maximus. Instead of humiliating him, he said seriously, “Spartacus, our biggest problem right now is the shortage of weapons and armor. Hamilcar mentioned earlier that after occupying this farming estate, aside from the ten sets of city guard equipment we obtained from the slain guards, we haven’t found any other weapons. At least half of the slaves who joined us are without weapons. Are we going to let them fight the Romans unarmed?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus was about to speak when Maximus cleared his throat. “May I speak a few words?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Feel free to speak,” Spartacus said, interested in hearing what Maximus had to say. This young man possessed knowledge about Italy that other gladiators lacked, which was why Spartacus tolerated and valued him. Of course, the half Thracian blood in his body also played a role.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I don’t have a solution, but I want to inform everyone,” Maximus began, combining his knowledge of ancient Rome from his previous life and the firsthand experiences of the original Maximus. He spoke earnestly, “A few decades ago, every citizen in Italian city-states who had some wealth in their homes would possess one or two sets of weapons, ready to answer the call of their city-state and fight alongside the Roman army. However, since Rome started recruiting unemployed vagrants using money and directly providing them with weapons to form their armies, these Italian civilians no longer needed to prepare their own weapons. Therefore, the households in the Campania region, including farms, are unlikely to possess many weapons. Only the towns, due to their obligation to establish city guard units according to Rome’s law, have armories to provide weapons for the city guards.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Are you suggesting… that we attack the towns and seize their armories?” Artorix frowned.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “No, I’m just informing you about the distribution of weapons in the Campania region to give you an idea,” Maximus quickly clarified.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “While the people of Campania may not be skilled in combat, we are also not adept at siege warfare. To minimize casualties, we should temporarily avoid attacking towns,” Spartacus said thoughtfully. “After raiding these farms, we can gather as many weapons as possible. Slaves who don’t have weapons for now can fight with sharpened sticks or wooden swords, just like during our training. Those things can still kill.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone nodded, understanding the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “However, Maximus, your words reminded me that the citizens of the entire Italy haven’t been equipped with weapons for decades. It’s likely they have little training in combat and are not capable of fighting us. As long as we can defeat the Roman army, we don’t have to worry about anything else!” Spartacus said passionately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His enthusiasm infected everyone, and they became excited.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus exclaimed, “No wonder those Capuans fight like women! That explains it. The Romans may be despicable, but they did a good job with this.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone burst into laughter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus joined in the laughter, but in his mind, he remembered the fate of Spartacus and the others in history.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus smiled and said, “Today, we have found a place to settle down, and many new brothers have joined us. We should celebrate properly! Hamilcar and Maximus, your first task as part of the logistics team is to prepare a sumptuous dinner for us and bring several dozen bottles of fine wine from the cellar. Let our brothers drink to their hearts’ content!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I wholeheartedly agree!” everyone exclaimed excitedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus was also happy because, through his efforts, he had gained the recognition of Spartacus and the others and had been given some authority, even if it was just assisting Hamilcar in the logistics team. It was still a significant progress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ………………………………………………………\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Gaius Claudius Glaber, born into Rome’s prominent Claudius family, was also the youngest of the eight praetors in the Roman Senate. Although he was serving as a praetor for a short time, he had no lack of war experience. In his youth, he had accompanied the Roman legions to Asia Minor to battle the king of Pontus. Later, he followed Sulla in his march on Rome. While he didn’t receive the same recognition as Lucullus and Pompey, he was still respected and had a relatively smooth political career in Rome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a praetor, he aimed to further advance his position—to become a consul. However, there were many competitors, and he lacked impressive military achievements and strong support. Even obtaining the opportunity for nomination would be difficult. He felt helpless in this regard. But in recent days, he discovered an opportunity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    A group of lowly gladiators initiated a rebellion at the Capua gladiator school and then fled to the Mount Vesuvius area. They occupied the hills, raided farms, killed civilians, and took slaves as hostages. Their actions grew increasingly disruptive, disturbing the peace in the entire Vesuvius region, and even threatening the safety of nearby towns and the Roman roads. But more importantly, it harmed the interests of the Roman senators and patricians in the area. Therefore, in the past two days, the senators had proposed sending troops to eliminate these rebels and swiftly passed a resolution.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the reports indicated that these thieves had already grown to several thousand in number, the senators only allowed half a legion to be deployed. It was evident that the senators did not consider these rebels a significant threat. However, if Glaber could quickly defeat them and restore peace to the Vesuvius region, he would surely gain some favor from the majority of the senators and recognition of his abilities.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was precisely because he saw this point that Glaber actively sought and petitioned to lead troops on this expedition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    According to regulations, praetors had the authority to lead troops, but the other praetors didn’t even bother with the small achievement of eliminating a handful of rebels. Thus, Glaber easily obtained this task. However, Rome didn’t have readily available troops, so he had to first issue a recruitment notice in the square. The news quickly spread throughout the city, and a large number of unemployed and poor citizens flocked to Campus Martius.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a first-time commander, Glaber was cautious. Based on the information he collected, although most of those rebels were a rabble of slaves, there was a group of gladiators leading them. Gladiators were not proficient in military strategy, but their individual combat abilities were astonishing. When the Germanic Cimbri invaded, the Roman army suffered consecutive defeats. The Senate urgently called upon Marius, who found the soldiers he recruited to be too inexperienced to resist the fierce barbarians. Following the advice of his colleague, Lucius Rufus, Marius recruited some gladiators and trained his soldiers using gladiatorial methods. The process was extremely rigorous, with soldiers being injured constantly. However, several months later, the new recruits’ individual combat abilities greatly improved, laying a solid foundation for the eventual defeat of the Cimbri.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 16": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 16 – Active Maximus\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    It was precisely considering these factors that Gaius Claudius Glaber instructed the recruiting officer to recruit soldiers with combat experience as much as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glaber’s idea was good, but the problem was that several years ago, one of Marius’ subordinates, Quintus Sertorius, initiated a rebellion in Iberia and achieved repeated victories. Later, he joined forces with the remnants of the populares faction and increased his military strength. In order to suppress the rebellion, Rome even violated centuries-old political traditions and allowed the 30-year-old Pompey, who was neither a praetor nor a former consul, to lead the troops into battle. They even reinforced him twice. As a result, there were very few excellent soldiers with combat experience left in Rome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glaber had to lower his requirements and recruit some veteran soldiers. These veterans were all former soldiers under Sulla and had marched on Rome with him. After Sulla became dictator, he fulfilled his promise by constructing colonial cities (such as Florence) within Italy and allocating land to his soldiers, ensuring their well-being. However, the problem was that these soldiers had been constantly fighting outside and had forgotten how to farm when their swords turned into plows. Year after year, many of them went bankrupt due to the mismanagement of their farmland. In their destitution, they had to return to Rome to seek a living. But now, ten years had passed since they had threatened Rome as soldiers, the veterans who were not recruited by Pompey were all over 40 years old.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glaber didn’t despise them; instead, he appointed these veterans as decanus and centurions to help him manage the new recruits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Within a few days, Glaber completed the recruitment of soldiers. After spending additional days organizing the army, Glaber led the troops into battle without conducting any training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The distance from Rome to Mount Vesuvius was about 200 kilometers. Even with the Via Latina and Via Annia, it would take four or five days to travel by land. Although traveling by sea would undoubtedly save time, Glaber chose to travel by land because it allowed the new recruits to march and set up camps, utilizing the time for training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ………………………………………………………\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I am Pullo, from Egypt, living by the banks of the lower Nile River. I used to own my own land, and it was very fertile! When the flood season was about to end, I would build embankments with mud and keep the remaining water in the fields. Then I would start sowing, and when the harvest season arrived, the fields would be filled with abundant wheat…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Later, there was turmoil in Egypt. The village chief, who had long coveted my land, falsely accused me of colluding with rebels. Without any investigation, the city lord arrested my entire family and threw us into prison. Later, we were sold to Roman slave traders and locked in the overcrowded and sweltering lower holds of the ship on the way to Italy… My wife… my children… all fell ill and died…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Standing in the center of the courtyard, wearing tattered clothes, a thin man resembling a skeleton spoke with tears streaming down his face. There were several people sitting around him, each with a solemn expression, listening attentively and empathizing with his words. Some even shed tears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, Maximus, who was sitting on the ground in the front row, stood up and passionately exclaimed, “Pullo is just like us, oppressed by the wealthy and powerful, losing our homes, losing our families, and forced to toil for the rich under the threat of punishment. Is this fair, brothers?!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Unfair!!!” the people around shouted angrily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Yes, it is very unfair,” Maximus spoke solemnly, pausing for a moment before raising his voice again. “Luckily, he has now joined us, joined our ranks composed of countless comrades who have suffered hardships. Here, there is no oppression, no tyranny, only mutual care and support. We stand united like brothers, all for the purpose of resisting the Romans, overthrowing the wealthy, and obtaining the freedom and happiness we desire. Brothers, am I right?!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “You’re right!!!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Welcome to our brotherhood, Pullo!” Maximus wore a sincere expression, giving him a tight embrace before leading him into the crowd, where everyone approached him for hugs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Pullo still had tears in his eyes, his emotions were evidently stirred.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The courtyard buzzed with noise for a while before gradually quieting down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus looked towards another new addition to the logistics team not too far away, an elderly slave. His face was weathered and estimated to be over 50 years old. So far, most of the recruits in the uprising were young slaves, making an elderly one like him somewhat rare. Naturally curious, Maximus spoke: “Next, please welcome our new brother to come forward and share his story.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The old man walked to the center of the courtyard. Compared to the previous nervousness of Pullo when he started speaking, the old man appeared calmer. “My name is Vorenus, a Samnite. I became a slave when I was very young. My master, Titus Longus, was a Roman equestrian. He treated me well, like family. Later, he even spent money to grant me freedom and sent me here to manage his farm…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Upon hearing these words, most of the slaves’ expressions turned sour. They came from various farms in the Vesuvius region, and the hardships they endured on those farms were mostly caused by overseers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “…I managed the farm well, and my master was pleased. He was even preparing to apply for my Roman citizenship… but Sulla… that damned Sulla!” The old man suddenly raised his voice, his face contorting in anger. “He led his army into Rome, massacring the populares. Someone falsely accused my master of colluding with Lepidus, when all he wanted was my master’s farm in Vesuvius. That tyrant didn’t bother to investigate the truth and executed my master. I was accused of frequently acting as my master’s messenger, passing information to the populares, and was stripped of my freedman status, becoming a slave again. My family… my family was sold off to different places, and I don’t know if they’re still alive or not… It’s been ten years! For these ten years, I have cursed Sulla and the Roman Senate every moment, yearning for revenge!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “When I first heard about you, I wanted to join, but the guards on the farm kept a close watch on me. Being old and feeble, I didn’t dare act recklessly. Today, when you broke into the farm where I was held, I was the first to respond to Commander Spartacus’ call. I swear to Jupiter that while I may not have the ability to fight the Romans, I am willing to do anything else that can help our cause in defeating them!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the old man spoke, the slaves’ opinion of him changed. When Maximus shouted, “Great!” they also applauded with enthusiasm (they learned that from Maximus), conveying their goodwill to Vorenus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “That’s enough for the self-introductions of our new brothers of the logistics team today. Starting tomorrow, a few of you will work with the rest of the group and get familiar with our tasks. Once you’re settled in, our leader, Hamilcar, will assign you specific duties. Understood?” Maximus asked with a friendly expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vorenus, Pullo, and a few others nodded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Reius.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Yes!” a thin man in his 40s responded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “You’ll be in charge of their accommodation arrangements.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Understood.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus surveyed the entire courtyard. It was filled with slaves sitting around, clearly more than there were at the beginning. They must have secretly come from other teams, and he was pleased to see it. He asked loudly, “Brothers, what should we do next?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Tell stories!!” the slaves cheered loudly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “No, before I tell stories, we need to learn!” Maximus said seriously. “Yesterday, we learned addition and subtraction within 10. Today, before we move on to new arithmetic, let’s review. Akgo, Cassius, bring the blackboard over.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Yes.” Two young slave boys immediately carried a wooden board to the center of the courtyard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    One side of the board was painted black. Maximus took a piece of chalk and said, “Let’s say there are five bags of wheat in the courtyard, and we bring in four more bags from another farm. How many bags of wheat are there in total now?” As he spoke, he wrote “5+4” on the blackboard and asked, “Who can solve this arithmetic problem?”\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 17": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 17 – Leader of the Logistics Team\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    “Me!” two young slave boys immediately shouted excitedly at the same time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “You two have answered the most questions in the past. Today, let others have this opportunity,” Maximus said as he looked around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “There are quite a few people who want to answer the questions!” Spartacus, who was peering at everything from outside the courtyard gate, whispered in surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “That’s because Maximus set a rule. As long as they study seriously and can correctly answer the questions he asks, they can have an extra piece of meat or an additional cup of wine for dinner on the next day. So these guys are more focused when learning what Maximus teaches,” Hamilcar explained quietly on the side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Your Logistics Team must not take advantage of the convenience to feed yourselves extra meals,” Spartacus reminded with a serious tone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We have no other choice,” Hamilcar immediately complained. “Now that we are acquiring more and more supplies, the people you assigned to us can handle physical work, but most of them are illiterate and don’t understand arithmetic. Maximus and I have to check the supplies until late at night. Maximus said to me, ‘Our group is still small, but we’re already so busy. If the number of people exceeds 10,000 in the future, won’t we be worked to death…’ So he suggested using the spare time every evening to teach everyone arithmetic and literacy. Once they all learn, we won’t be so overwhelmed.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar continued, “I agreed with his opinion, but the actual implementation is not that easy. Many people are unwilling to use their brains to study. That’s why Maximus came up with the method of using food as a stimulus. He also added storytelling and even came up with such simple symbols to represent numbers. That’s why our brothers are so actively gathering in the courtyard after dinner, lighting bonfires, and earnestly studying. Look, they even attracted people from other teams…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Why do you let the newly joined brothers speak publicly about their experiences?” Spartacus curiously asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “You know, these slaves who join our team come from all directions—Asia Minor, Northern Greece, Iberia, Greece, Egypt, Numidia, Gaul, Germania, Italy, Illyria…” Hamilcar counted on his fingers, listing them one by one. “Their customs and habits are different, their personalities are different, and their languages are different. When they gather together, conflicts are inevitable. It’s easier here since we have fewer people, but I’ve heard that fights often break out in other teams. I imagine you and Crixus must be troubled by this, right?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus nodded, signaling Hamilcar to continue.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Maximus found a solution to this problem! He told me: ‘Although our brothers come from different backgrounds, they all share the common experience of being oppressed by the rich and patricians, as lowly slaves under Roman oppression. They all have tragic experiences. If we let them publicly share their past experiences, it will easily evoke resonance among everyone and promote mutual acceptance, making them close comrades in the fight against a common enemy…’ I followed his advice and let him implement this method. So far, the results have been excellent. You can see that our Logistics Team is the most united team, and so far, there have been no fights or brawls.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “…This method seems good and can be implemented in other teams. After you take over the military affairs, you can be in charge of this,” Spartacus pondered and said, “As for the candidate to replace you and become the leader of the Logistics Team…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar said anxiously, “Spartacus, I’ve brought you here to observe for so long. Why are you still not confident? Although Maximus is young, he has the ability and insight. Moreover, he is eager to learn. After following me for so many days, he not only learned how to manage the Logistics Team and satisfy the team’s needs but also made many improvements. I can handle the military affairs for you these days because Maximus has taken sole responsibility for this team. Let me tell you the truth, Maximus’ prestige in the Logistics Team is higher than mine now. Everyone is willing to listen to him. If you let someone else take over as the leader of the Logistics Team, it might cause trouble!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Listening to Hamilcar’s reminder, Spartacus looked towards the center of the courtyard. Maximus was writing and drawing on a wooden board with limestone while explaining loudly. The eyes of the slaves around him were focused on him, listening attentively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing Spartacus remaining silent, Hamilcar couldn’t help but continue, “Spartacus, is it because you still don’t trust Maximus due to the incident where he was forced to betray?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus shook his head first, then nodded, “Maximus’ recent performance is enough to earn the trust of every one of us! However… his act of betrayal has left Crixus resentful, and some of our gladiator brothers have objections, including Oenomaus.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “So what? As long as you and I support him in the meeting, Artorix will also support him. Even if Crixus and Oenomaus oppose, the minority must obey the majority, and Maximus will become the new leader of the Logistics Team.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus was about to speak when he heard orderly shouts from the courtyard, “Maximus, tell a story! Tell a story! Tell a story!!!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Alright! Alright!” Maximus smiled and pressed his hands down, gesturing for everyone to quiet down. The shouting immediately subsided. “You have all studied diligently tonight, so shall I continue telling the story of Troy?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Yes!!!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus looked at the lively scene in the courtyard and finally made up his mind. He said to Hamilcar, “Alright, let’s go with your suggestion. Let’s discuss it tomorrow and let Maximus take over as the leader of the Logistics Team, while you will come to manage the military affairs. Although we have more people now, most of them lack training. You need to quickly focus on military training. Otherwise, we might have trouble when fighting against the Roman legions!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Okay, I will take care of it as soon as possible,” Hamilcar responded solemnly, understanding the urgency of the matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ………………………………………………\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Please come in, Maximus. We are all waiting for you.” After hearing Spartacus’ words, Maximus entered the room.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus straightforwardly said: “We just had a discussion, and we unanimously decided to make you the leader of the Logistics Team.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Upon hearing this, Maximus felt ecstatic inside. His efforts over the past month had not been in vain after all!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus surveyed the room: Spartacus looked expectant, Artorix showed enthusiasm, Crixus had a cold expression, and Oenomaus’ brows were slightly furrowed…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally, his gaze fell on Hamilcar:\n    <br/>\n    The gladiator who had the closest relationship with him was smiling and nodding towards him…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He suppressed his excitement and put on a concerned expression as he asked, “What about Hamilcar?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “He will be in charge of managing the military affairs and assist us in organizing our growing army. Tell me, do you have the confidence to handle the Logistics Team on your own?” Spartacus looked at him and asked seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Of course, no problem!” Maximus confidently replied in a loud voice. He knew he couldn’t show any weakness at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Humph, what’s the use of empty words? We’ll see if you can do it in due time,” Crixus interjected coldly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus pretended not to hear the sarcastic remark.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The supply of food and other resources is crucial for us. Therefore, in the future, when we discuss matters concerning our entire army, you will also participate and provide us with information about the reserves. Of course, you can also give us suggestions, and we will discuss them together, understood?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Understood!” Maximus could no longer suppress his joy and smiled:\n    <em>\n     Now, I have finally become one of the leaders of this uprising! Even though I have the fewest number of people under my command, I’m still one of the six key figures of this rebel army!\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During this time, under the proposals of Spartacus and Hamilcar, a Military Commanders Assembly was established to manage the growing team and handle various complicated matters. The military commanders in charge of the meeting were Spartacus, Crixus, Hamilcar, Oenomaus, and Artorix, the five gladiators who had initially led the revolt. Additionally, when encountering important matters that concerned the entire army’s life and death, a soldiers’ assembly had to be held to make decisions.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 18": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 18 – Military Commanders Assembly\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    While the majority of gladiators were still indulging in daily killings, looting, and excessive drinking, Maximus had already keenly realized that the Military Commanders Assembly had become the highest authority in the entire rebel army. He began finding ways to become a part of it as soon as possible, in order to gain greater influence over the rebel forces. Now that he had finally achieved his goal, how could he not be happy?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Don’t get too excited! Although you can participate in the Military Commanders Assembly, you’re just a participant. You can suggest ideas, but you have no decision-making power!” Crixus coldly said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus’ words poured cold water on Maximus’ excitement, his expression stiffened briefly before looking to Hamilcar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar nodded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Sit down, we have other matters to discuss,” Spartacus said without further explanation, urging them to proceed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus let out a sigh and expelled his frustration:\n    <em>\n     Well, being present is better than not. At least I’m in, and I’ll work harder to become an official member in the future.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus adjusted his mood and found an empty wooden stool to sit on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We’ve all agreed to start training the troops, but we need to come up with a plan on how to proceed with the training,” Spartacus looked at the others in the room and asked, “Do you have any suggestions?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Training the troops is simple,” Oenomaus interjected, “After dinner, before the sun sets, let our gladiator brothers in each unit serve as instructors and train our newly recruited brothers using the training methods from the gladiator school. I believe that within two or three months, the combat abilities of the new recruits will significantly improve.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The school’s training methods are too rigorous. Doing that might cause dissatisfaction among the new recruits. We’ve already had enough fights and brawls in the camp recently. If we provoke more conflicts and clashes, it could…” Artorix expressed his concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Let our gladiator brothers lower the requirements. There’s no need to be as strict as in the school. Moreover, after implementing that method Spartacus mentioned earlier, it will definitely foster a more friendly atmosphere among everyone, so you don’t have to worry about that,” Crixus mentioned “that method” which referred to the “airing of grievances” promoted by Maximus in the supply team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For some psychological reason, Crixus only briefly mentioned it and quickly shifted the topic: “However, the main problem is that even if we lower the requirements, the training will still be strenuous. Our brothers are already tired from daytime activities, and adding training at night might be too much to handle.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “During this period, our army has been expanding continuously, and we have obtained more and more resources. We have basically raided all the nearby farms,” Spartacus said earnestly. “I think there’s no urgent need to send all our teams down the mountain every day. We can let the different teams take turns attacking the more distant farms, while the teams staying here at the base can focus on training. This way, we will have sufficient time to organize our forces. You see, some of our brothers serving as centurions don’t even know how many soldiers they have under their command, let alone familiarize themselves with their names. How can they lead them into battle against the Romans? This won’t do. We need to make changes quickly!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others in the room could sense Spartacus’ anxiety. As leaders themselves, they shared the same sentiments and expressed their agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then, Hamilcar offered his suggestion, “I believe it’s not appropriate to focus solely on training the individual combat abilities of our brothers. In a battle involving thousands of soldiers, it’s often the side with better organization and discipline that triumphs over the courageous but chaotic opposition. Therefore, in addition to individual training, it’s necessary to conduct collective training for all teams, teaching them how to assemble, march, maneuver into formations, switch formations, and follow commands to engage in battle or retreat in a timely manner.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I agree,” Spartacus responded first, as it was a plan he had discussed with Hamilcar.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I agree too,” Artorix followed suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus didn’t respond immediately, but instead asked, “Hamilcar, what kind of collective training are you planning to conduct?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We will train our brothers using Roman tactics and formations. I have spent time in the Roman legion with Spartacus, so I have some understanding of their methods,” Hamilcar replied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Why should we use Roman tactics in our battles?!” Oenomaus expressed his dissatisfaction, “We should practice our Germanic wedge formation tactics instead. Once we master them, we can easily defeat the Romans!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The Romans may not be very strong or tall, but they have managed to conquer many races and establish dominance in the Mediterranean primarily because of their tactics,” Spartacus patiently explained. “Oenomaus, I have heard you talk about the tactics of your Germanic people before, and they are indeed excellent. However, in our army, most of our brothers, especially the new recruits, are not as strong and tall as us gladiators, and they lack combat experience. They have suffered from abuse, are physically weak, and don’t have enough strength to break through the Romans’ tight defense lines or penetrate their shield formations. That’s why Roman tactics are suitable for them. Just think about it, when our brothers learn the Roman tactics and combine them with their superior courage and hatred for the Romans, can the Roman army still defeat us?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Oenomaus scratched his head and remained silent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus pondered for a moment and said, “We need to train our brothers’ individual combat abilities and conduct collective training. After a whole day of training, their physical exertion will be significant. Can our brothers endure it?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I have considered your concern as well. We can provide them with an additional meal at noon. When our brothers are well-fed, they will naturally have the energy to continue training,” Hamilcar replied, looking at Maximus. “How much food do we have in stock?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We have 600 tons of wheat, 200 tons of barley, 1,000 kilograms of smoked pork, 750 kilograms of smoked fish, 240 sheep, and 23 cows…” Maximus answered quickly without much thought. “If we calculate based on our current army of 5,000 people, it’s enough to feed us for half a year. If we add an extra meal at lunchtime, ensuring that our brothers eat well and have the energy to continue training, it will last us for over three months. Moreover, we will also capture new farms to obtain more food, so there’s no need to worry about food shortages.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus looked at everyone, confidently suggesting, “We can even add more meat to the lunch and provide diluted wine. This way, our brothers will be more willing to train when they are well-fed and well-hydrated.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Well, that’s a good idea. As the new leader of the Logistics Team, you will be responsible for these matters,” Hamilcar said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Alright,” Maximus quickly nodded, showing respect for the former leader.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one else objected, and the decision to conduct military training was finalized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Since we have already looted all the nearby farms. We should discuss which direction to attack next,” Crixus reminded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “For now, let’s not go south. It’s close to the coast and has multiple towns. They may not dare attack us, but will still hinder our farm raids and supply transport. To go east, the journey is far and we have to bypass Mount Vesuvius. It’s better to go north first. When we become stronger, we can consider other options,” Spartacus had long considered this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Despite Crixus and Oenomaus often boasting to their respective subordinates about being able to easily defeat any enemy, deep down, they still had some fear of the Roman army. That’s why they unanimously agreed to establish their base on the mountainside. Now, with the possibility of Roman army attacking at any time, they were even less willing to lead their forces away from the main stronghold and approach hostile towns. Therefore, they naturally didn’t oppose Spartacus’ suggestion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Oenomaus added, “If we attack east, we can have Omarkel monitor Via Annia. In case there are more weapon-carrying wagons passing by, we can intercept them and distribute the weapons to our brothers. We have too few weapons at the moment!”\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 19": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 19 – The Shameless Maximus\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    Although Oenomaus’ idea was somewhat naive, given the chaotic situation in the northern region of Mount Vesuvius caused by the rebel army, the nearby Via Annia had become desolate. It was nearly impossible to encounter a fortunate situation like before. However, the issue he raised was indeed the primary concern for everyone: it had been a month since they escaped from Capua, and their forces had swelled to nearly 5,000 people. Yet, only less than 500 individuals had simple weapons (such as wooden shields, short swords, or spears).\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During this period, everyone had come up with many ideas but was unable to overcome the dilemma of the weapon shortage.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a moment of silence, Spartacus spoke in a deep voice, “Oenomaus’ suggestion is not bad. We can have Omarkel send his men to give it a try. However, our main focus should be on intensifying the training of our brothers starting tomorrow, to quickly enhance their combat abilities. Only then can we defeat and seize the weapons and equipment of the Roman army when they arrive! If they don’t come for the time being, we can’t foolishly wait for them to gather a large army to besiege us. We must take the initiative to attack small towns like Pompeii, seize their armories, and equip our brothers. This is the only way we can have a chance against the Roman army.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whether defeating the Roman army or capturing cities, both would be difficult. But everyone realized that the rebel army had no other choice. In the end, they all expressed their agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the meeting, Hamilcar gathered all the members of the Logistics Team in the courtyard and announced that Maximus would be their new leader.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as the announcement was made, cheers erupted from all around, and some even applauded vigorously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar turned to Maximus and said, “We made the right decision. It seems everyone is eager to have you as their leader.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “That’s because of your full support, Teacher, and selflessly teaching me many things these days!” Maximus said sincerely. After assisting Hamilcar in his work and frequently seeking his advice, Maximus began calling him “Teacher.” Initially, Hamilcar was uncomfortable with it, but Maximus persisted, and eventually, Hamilcar accepted it silently. As a result, he also grew to trust Maximus and often allowed him to take charge. It was one of the main reasons why he proactively recommended Maximus to Spartacus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “It’s all for the sake of our team. I entrust the Logistics Team to you. You must manage it well and avoid any mishaps!” Hamilcar earnestly advised. “If you encounter any difficulties that you can’t solve, feel free to come to me. We will discuss and find a solution together.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus immediately took the opportunity and said, “Teacher, I have a problem right now and I hope to have your support.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “You’re quite shameless, brat,” Hamilcar scolded, but he wasn’t truly angry. After spending time together in the team, he had grown accustomed to the young man’s thick skin. “Go ahead, what’s the difficult problem?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The Logistics Team is short-staffed!” Maximus hurriedly explained, afraid that Hamilcar would object. “Although the number of people in the team seems substantial now, with nearly 200 people, and it’s increasing every day, you should know what kind of people they are. There are over 50 women, more than 30 elderly individuals over 40 years old, and over 20 children. Although there are still over 80 adult men, they are either frail or sickly… In short, most of the additional manpower for the team is the old, weak, sick, or disabled——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “You should be aware that the Roman army may attack at any time, and our newly joined slave brothers will of course be incorporated into the major teams first. Now is not the time to prioritize the Logistics Team!” Hamilcar finally interrupted him, reminding him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I understand that, but when Spartacus and others are in battle, the Logistics Team needs to be there as well. It may not be apparent during the routine activities of seizing farms or collecting food, but during the entire battle, the Logistics Team members will struggle to adapt to the intense battle. They won’t be able to fulfill their roles and may become a burden instead!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus spoke earnestly, having considered this issue for a while. He even preemptively countered Hamilcar’s possible remedies: “Even if we assign combat troops to assist the Logistics Team during battles, they’re unfamiliar with the Logistics Team. It will only create confusion. They may not even follow commands, and if they abandon the team during critical moments to engage in combat, it will put the team in danger… Therefore, it’s best to allocate some of the strong slave brothers to the Logistics Team!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After hearing Maximus’s words, Hamilcar’s expression also turned serious. He pondered for a while before saying, “Alright, I will mention this to Spartacus first. You’re now the leader of the Logistics Team and can participate in the Military Commanders Assembly. When we all gather next time, you can bring up this matter for discussion. But even if it’s approved, the number of personnel assigned to the team won’t be significant.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Having some will do,” Maximus replied with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Are there any other difficult problems?” Hamilcar blinked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Not for now,” Maximus replied with a smile. In fact, he had other suggestions, but he knew he had to take it one step at a time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Looking at Hamilcar’s departing figure, Maximus clenched his fists with excitement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His diligent efforts during this past month had not been in vain. He had finally become the leader of the Logistics Team! Although it was partly due to his ability to read and do arithmetic, as well as the lack of competition from other gladiators involved in the rebellion within the Logistics Team, his demonstrated capabilities were also evident. Otherwise, even with Hamilcar’s recommendation, he wouldn’t have been approved during the assembly. In the eyes of those gladiators who only knew how to fight fiercely, the Logistics Team was where the weaklings belonged. However, when Spartacus appointed Hamilcar as the leader of the team and allowed him to participate in the Military Commanders Assembly to discuss military affairs, Maximus realized that joining the Logistics Team and becoming its leader was undoubtedly the best choice for a young man like him, who lacked prestige and a tainted reputation among the gladiators. It was just surprising how quickly he achieved his goal, even beyond his own expectations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as he was feeling excited, someone approached him with a smile on their face and said, “Captain Maximus, now that you have become the leader of our team, should we celebrate?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus looked at her.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This woman in her 30s was named Agnes, from Egypt. Her family had become slaves due to heavy debts and was sold to a large farm in the Vesuvius region. Her husband was assigned to work in the fields, while she became a cook. Two years ago, her eldest daughter was forcibly taken into the farm overseer’s house. After becoming pregnant, she was abandoned like worn-out shoes, eventually dying in childbirth. The grieving couple hastily buried her, but they didn’t dare show the slightest hint of resentment towards the farm overseer. Not long after, her husband passed away in sorrow. Agnes endured the pain and carefully guarding her underage younger daughter, fearing that she would be harmed too. These past two years had been filled with constant worry for her. Thanks to the rebel army breaking into the farm and killing the resisting overseer on the spot, she was the first among the farm slaves to actively join the rebels. She even took a butcher’s knife and hacked the overseer’s body to vent her anger…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the number of personnel in the Logistics Team grew, Hamilcar wanted to appoint a leader to manage the kitchen. He originally had another male slave in mind, but Maximus strongly recommended Agnes to him. Because of his frequent work with the Logistics Team members, Maximus had discovered that Agnes, despite being a woman, was bold and efficient in her work. She had a commanding influence among the group of people working in the kitchen. Maximus, coming from the modern society, didn’t hold the same discriminatory views towards women as the era he found himself in. Under his insistence, Agnes became the first female leader in the uprising team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus himself didn’t have the habit of doing good deeds anonymously. Instead, he made sure his contributions were known to others, and as a result, he earned Agnes’ gratitude.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a serious expression, Maximus said to Agnes, “Thank you for your kindness, but now is not the time for celebration. We must first do our tasks well and prove to our brothers fighting outside that Spartacus’ decision to make me the leader is the right one.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 20": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 20 – Suggestions from Subordinates (I)\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    Maximus had another consideration that he didn’t voice out: as a former gladiator who had escaped, he had once betrayed his comrades. Now, he had suddenly risen to a high position within the rebel army. Even though the Logistics Team was looked down upon by others, it was inevitable that some would feel jealous. Therefore, he decided it was best to keep a low profile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Agnes didn’t think too much about it. Out of respect for Maximus, she patted her chest and said loudly, “Captain Maximus, don’t worry, I will supervise them (the other kitchen personnel) to work diligently!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus nodded and looked around at the people in the courtyard. He spoke loudly, “From now on, I am the leader of the Logistics Team! Don’t worry, everything will remain the same as before. Continue to do your tasks well, and then gather in this courtyard at night. Follow me to learn and listen to my stories. How does that sound?!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Great!!!” The crowd shouted in unison.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …………………………………………………\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When Maximus said, “Everything in the logistics team will remain the same,” it was just a comforting phrase to stabilize the morale. After the Logistics Team members finished listening to the story and went to rest, Maximus called several leaders within the team for a meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The meeting took place in Maximus’s bedroom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus’s bedroom was a single room in the main building of the vineyard. Although Maximus was already familiar with the other people in the room, tonight, illuminated by candlelight, he took another look at them:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Agnes, the fierce woman in charge of the kitchen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cornelius, a thin and elderly male slave responsible for guarding the warehouse and managing supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    And Pigres, a relatively strong man in charge of the wagons for delivering goods. Unfortunately, he was lame in his left leg.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The higher-ups of the Logistics Team didn’t seem to have impressive backgrounds, but Agnes was skilled in kitchen affairs, Cornelius was one of the few slaves in the rebel army who could read and write, and Pigres had excellent carriage-driving skills. Each of them had their own expertise, and the three leaders shared a common characteristic—they all hated Romans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Agnes didn’t need further explanation. Cornelius was a Sabine, originally having a few acres of land to sustain himself, but he fell into debt and his family was destroyed due to the land consolidation by Roman nobles. Pigres, on the other hand, was a Greek from Asia Minor, forced to be involved in the war between Rome and Pontus. He was captured and enslaved by the Roman army due to his injuries…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    All three of them were older than Maximus, but they looked at the young Maximus with respect. It wasn’t just because Maximus had been working and teaching them for almost a month, but also because this group of gladiators who started the revolt were their benefactors and the backbone of the current army. From the commanders to the centurions and even some leader of ten (decanus), gladiators held positions of authority. In their eyes, Maximus, as one of them, was only fitting to hold an important position.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus was satisfied with their respectful attitude and asked directly, “You three have been leading the Logistics Team for a while now. What are your thoughts and suggestions regarding the matters you oversee?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three of them were taken aback when they heard this. They didn’t expect Maximus to call them for a meeting late at night to ask for their suggestions. The previous leader, Hamilcar, was known for giving direct orders and never consulted or listened to their suggestions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the silence from the three, Maximus realized their cautiousness and immediately smiled, speaking in a soothing tone, “As Commander Spartacus once said, ‘Once you join our ranks, we are brothers and sisters.’ We all belong to the Logistics Team, so the matters of this team are everyone’s concern. While you were working, you must have noticed some issues. Let’s discuss and solve them together to make our team better, right?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus’s words dispelled their concerns. Agnes spoke up first, “Captain Maximus, then…then I’ll say it…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Speak freely!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Agnes bit her lip and said, “The biggest problem in the kitchen… is that there are too many women. They work diligently, but they are constantly harassed by soldiers from other teams. Although Commander Spartacus has previously issued orders to ‘prohibit people from other teams from entering the farm,’ they still frequently sneak in! The Patrol Team responsible for guarding the farm are aware of it but don’t make a wholehearted effort to stop them. Especially the soldiers from the Second Team who often enter the kitchen and touch my subordinates. They are so scared that they can’t work properly! Captain, you must manage this properly; otherwise, the kitchen will be chaotic, and we won’t be able to carry out our tasks!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus frowned. He was aware of this issue and had brought it up to Hamilcar before. But Hamilcar didn’t take it seriously. He believed: The rebel army was mostly young men full of energy and curiosity about women. As long as they didn’t truly assault the women of the Logistics Team, allowing them to indulge in some verbal desires could help boost their desire to fight.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Additionally, the Second Team was under the command of Crixus. Due to Crixus’s indulgence, their discipline was indeed poor. However, Spartacus considered Crixus as one of the leaders of the rebel army, and with his stubborn and obstinate personality, he was hesitant to address or prevent this issue, fearing it would affect unity. If even Spartacus had reservations, then Hamilcar certainly had no intention to intervene either.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus knew this matter was difficult to handle, but he still earnestly noted it down on the wax tablet with an iron stylus. Then he asked, “Very well, are there any other issues?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Yes!” Agnes, feeling affirmed and no longer hesitant, spoke loudly, “Although there are over 100 people assigned to our kitchen, they have to cook porridge and stew twice a day, grind flour, knead dough, bake bread, and distribute food to the various teams’ camps… They are busy from morning till night without any rest.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Everyone is working so hard, but despite of that, we can barely meet the needs of the entire army. And every day, there are so many more people joining the army. If we don’t increase the manpower in our kitchen, I’m afraid some people will go hungry. Also, we need more stoves, ovens, grinding mills… Without these things, even if we have more manpower, we won’t be able to produce enough food.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus nodded solemnly and noted it down on the wax tablet. Then he asked, “Anything else?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “There’s also the issue of sleeping,” Agnes continued, “The Logistics Team lacks tents. We sleep in the yard when it’s sunny, and when it rains, we squeeze under the eaves of the warehouse and main building. We have so many women in the kitchen, so it’s very inconvenient, and it also makes us prone to illness.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus frowned again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since Spartacus and the other leaders chose this place as their base, but with the rapid expansion of the rebel army, the farm couldn’t accommodate so many people anymore. It later became a storage base, and the Logistics Team responsible for guarding the supplies naturally stayed in the farm. Apart from the leaders of the rebel army who still resided in the farm, more than 4,000 soldiers were stationed in the hills and plains surrounding the farm. They also lacked tents, and they believed that the Logistics Team had better accommodation conditions, so they wouldn’t agree to give any tents to the Logistics Team…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “This is indeed a problem.” Maximus knew that this matter was not easy to solve, but he still showed a serious attitude and noted it down on his wax tablet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I’ve said everything.” Agnes looked at Cornelius and urged, “Old man, if you have any difficulties in your area, hurry up and tell the captain!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the three leaders of the logistics team didn’t know each other before joining the uprising, they had formed a good bond in just over 20 days due to their similar tragic experiences and frequent interactions at work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cornelius nodded to Agnes and calmly said, “There are three problems that need to be solved in the warehouse area. First, people from other teams often come in and steal things, like smoked fish, smoked meat, wine, and such. We can’t stop them, and we even get beaten. The Patrol Team is not effective, and sometimes they even join in the stealing;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The second issue is that we are receiving more and more supplies now, and the few warehouses in the farm are already full. Storing them in the yard is not easy to manage, and they are prone to damage in windy or rainy weather. We also need to be careful about fire safety;\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The third problem is… I am old and have limited abilities. I can barely manage the supplies in one farm, but now we have accumulated supplies from over a dozen farms. My subordinates didn’t understand arithmetic before and only learned a little in the past few days under your leadership, Captain. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of these supplies. I need a few subordinates with strong arithmetic skills. Otherwise, the supply management of the Logistics Team will become more and more chaotic…”\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 21": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 21 – Suggestions from Subordinates (II)\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    Maximus listened attentively, his iron stylus continuously writing on the wax tablet. After finishing, he didn’t immediately respond but looked at Pigres and asked, “What difficulties do you have on your side?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Captain Maximus, like Uncle Cornelius, I also have three problems here,” Pigres replied, following Cornelius’ example. He raised three fingers and responded solemnly, “The first problem is that every day I lead the Wagon Team to follow the main force. Our task is to transport all the captured spoils back here. However, after the farm was taken over, the Wagon Team was the last to be allowed inside. As a result, many things inside were already taken by people from other major teams. They even said to my face that we only scavenge what they leave behind…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this point, Pigres appeared somewhat angry, but he quickly realized it was inappropriate and composed himself. He continued, “The second problem is that the Wagon Team lacks carpenters who can repair the wagons. Initially, we had a total of 20 wagons, but now we can only use 13. With daily heavy loads and the uneven road up this mountain, a wagon gets damaged every two or three days. Although we can continue to sustain the team by seizing wagons, it’s a pity to leave the broken wagons abandoned in the yard. If we can repair them, the Wagon Team can transport more goods in one trip, reducing the need for multiple round trips in a day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The third problem is related to those sheep that Commander Hamilcar initially assigned to me. At that time, there were only a dozen sheep, and I still had the energy to feed them together with the horses. But now, the number has increased to over 240, along with six cows. The farm doesn’t have sheep pen originally, and the surrounding areas are occupied by other teams. We could only build a makeshift large sheep pen about 1 kilometer north of the farm, where the sheep can rest and graze during the day. However, it’s difficult to manage because we lack enough personnel for sheep herding, and people from other teams often come to steal sheep. We lose sheep every day, and even Sextus has complained to me several times. But I can’t do anything about it. My focus is mainly on the Wagon Team, and the sheep pen is too far away for me to oversee…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening, Maximus didn’t immediately respond. He looked at the three of them and said, “Do you have any other issues?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “No, that’s all,” Agnes replied eagerly, and Pigres and Cornelius nodded in agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus looked at the wax tablet filled with Latin words and contemplated for a while before addressing them:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The problems you have raised can be summarized as a lack of manpower and resources. It’s not just a shortage of ordinary laborers. Agnes, you need more people who are skilled in kitchen work. Cornelius, you want people who are good at arithmetic to help you manage the stored supplies. Pigres, you need carpenters to repair the wagons and people knowledgeable in animal husbandry to take care of the cattle and sheep. But more importantly, all three of you have mentioned our Logistics Team’s lack of security and excessive reliance on external forces…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus looked at the three individuals and spoke with a more serious tone, “In other words, what we need in our Logistics Team is a patrol unit directly under our command, capable of ensuring our safety and preventing people from other teams from causing trouble!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “You’re absolutely right, Captain!” Agnes exclaimed loudly, no longer concealing her feelings of approval and disapproval. “We have brought up these issues to Commander Hamilcar before, but he simply doesn’t care. You, on the other hand, show us great concern and value. Right, old man Cornelius? Pigres?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pigres vigorously nodded in agreement, while Cornelius merely stroked his chin without responding.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus observed their reactions and cleared his throat loudly, saying, “Commander Hamilcar isn’t uncaring, he knows that providing enough manpower for you is not an easy task. It’s even more difficult for the Logistics Team to have its own patrol unit. Right now, all the major teams are busy expanding their forces to counter the potential attacks from the Roman army. Naturally, they won’t agree to allocate young men to join our team. But you don’t need to worry. I have taken note of all these concerns and will find ways to solve your problems. It will just take some time.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The sincere attitude displayed by Maximus made the three individuals feel that this newly appointed leader was not just going through the motions but genuinely wanted to address the problems. They didn’t feel discouraged but rather expressed their understanding, advising Maximus not to be too impatient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “As for the lack of kitchen equipment, warehouses, and tents that you mentioned, I think this problem is relatively easier to solve,” Maximus paused for a moment and said in a deep voice, “Since this farm no longer has enough space to store supplies, we can use other farms as additional bases for our Logistics Team. I remember there’s a large olive oil farm not far down the mountain.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “But… although our army has already taken that farm, there are no soldiers stationed near it now. If our Logistics Team sends people to occupy that farm, it could be dangerous if the Roman army suddenly attacks,” Cornelius voiced his concerns.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Of course, we can’t occupy that farm alone. We need other major teams to be stationed nearby to ensure safety,” Maximus had already considered this and replied, “Our army is currently large in number, but the concentration here up this mountain is too dense! It would be better to divide and occupy several farms to expand our territory… I will propose this matter to Spartacus and other leaders and try my best to persuade them..”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Captain, if what you said can be implemented, it would indeed solve the problem of the lack of kitchen equipment. However, we were already short on people, and this would only exacerbate the issue!” Agnes reminded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “You don’t need to worry about that. As long as Commander Spartacus agrees to designate other farms as supply bases for our Logistics Team, they will have to provide us with more manpower,” Maximus confidently replied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “But if the other farms also have kitchens, warehouses, and wagon teams, would we need new leaders for them too?” Agnes followed up with her question.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this, Maximus looked at the anxious Agnes, then at the calm but tightly clasped hands of Pigres, and finally at the nonchalant Cornelius. He nodded and said, “That’s certain, for the sake of better management. However, as the Logistics Team grows larger in the future, I will establish additional leaders such as the Chief of Kitchens, Chief of Warehouses, and Chief of Wagon Teams above these leaders to avoid any chaos.” As he spoke, Maximus smiled at the three individuals.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The meaning behind his words couldn’t be clearer, and it immediately excited Agnes, while Pigres straightened his posture. Only Cornelius maintained his nonchalant expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After dangling the carrot in front of these three people, Maximus continued, “Pigres, based on what you just said, it seems you no longer wish to oversee the sheep?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Captain, I spend my whole day leading the Wagon Team and have no time to take care of the sheep and cattle!” Pigres explained hastily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Since that’s the case…” Maximus pretended to ponder and said, “Let’s establish a separate team for herding and assign someone else to take charge. Do you have any recommended candidates?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Sextus.” Pigres blurted out, “He can handle it. He used to be a slave herding sheep and cattle for the Romans, and now he’s been taking care of them.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     Sextus…\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus tried hard to recall, and a vague face finally appeared in his mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus had been in the Logistics Team all along and was familiar with the majority of the people. However, he was somewhat unfamiliar with Sextus because the man spent his days herding the animals outside, leaving little opportunity for Maximus to interact with him. Therefore, he responded, “Call him over later. I’ll talk to him first before deciding.”\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 22": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 22 – A New Broom Sweeps Clean\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    Pigres looked hesitant and said, “Captain, it’s already late at night.

Shall I call him tomorrow morning?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Alright,” Maximus restrained his smile, looked at the three individuals, and solemnly said, “If we want Spartacus and other leaders to agree to my proposal and solve the problems of our Logistics Team, we must do better than before. We need to make the soldiers from other teams realize the importance of our team, and they will be happy to see our team grow stronger.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The three individuals exchanged glances upon hearing this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus continued, “The three of you are already working diligently and responsibly, but we can do even better. For example, Agnes, in the kitchen that you are in charge of, breakfast consists of a bowl of barley porridge, two pieces of bread, a piece of cheese, a bowl of meat soup, and a small portion of vegetables. Dinner is a small piece of smoked meat, two pieces of bread, and a bowl of meat soup… It has hardly changed in over 20 days. The soldiers eat just to fill their stomachs. Of course, it’s not easy for the kitchen to provide sufficient food for so many people, but if you could spare a little more effort and carefully consider how to make the food tastier, that would be even better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “For example, when stewing the soup, adding some dried seaweed and shellfish that we confiscated from a large farm four days ago, it will surely make the meat soup more flavorful. Or, brushing a layer of honey water on the freshly baked bread, or occasionally slaughtering two or three more sheep to make roast meat and distribute it to the soldiers, or occasionally slaughtering some chickens and ducks to make soup for them to drink——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “But Captain, if we do that, our daily expenses will be very high!” Agnes couldn’t help interrupting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Our supplies are all looted. There are plenty of farms around here. When we finish the good stuff, we will seize other good things,” Maximus smiled dismissively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Agnes and Hamilcar both came from humble backgrounds, and their inherent values emphasized frugality and thrift. Maximus understood this, but he couldn’t continue to do things the same way. As a newly appointed leader of the Logistics Team, he needed the team to undergo some obvious changes as soon as possible to win the soldiers’ approval. Of course, he didn’t express this thought openly but continued righteously, “The brothers who joined us have suffered a lot in the past. Now, they have to fight against the Roman army and may die on the battlefield at any time. Providing them with delicious food, and making their journey in this world worthwhile, is the only thing our Logistics Team can do for them! Let’s put more effort into making this food even tastier, so they can occasionally feel surprised and grateful. Then, when we make requests, we will receive their support…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus’ words deeply moved Agnes, and she immediately spoke up, “Captain, you’re right. I will do as you say and do my best to make the food even more delicious.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pigres quickly followed up with a question, “Do we need to make some changes to the Wagon Team as well, Captain?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus nodded approvingly and glanced at Cornelius before saying, “I do have some ideas for the Wagon and Warehouse Teams, but it’s not the right time yet. We’ll discuss it later.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Oh,” Pigres responded with a mix of anxiety and anticipation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Let’s end the discussion for tonight. Everyone, go back and rest quickly, so it doesn’t affect our work tomorrow,” Maximus said, but then he remembered something and called out to Agnes, who was about to leave the room.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Captain, rest assured, I’ll make sure everyone has breakfast ready tomorrow morning,” Agnes hurriedly said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus knew she had misunderstood and smiled as he said, “Go and call Akgo, Cassius, Gallus, Nasya… all the children. Although my room is small, we can squeeze in with the children. At least it’s much better than them sleeping outside in the courtyard.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nasya was Agnes’ youngest daughter, and she immediately responded with a smile, “Okay, I’ll go and call them.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the three left, Maximus fell into deep thought. Based on their performance just now, Agnes was enthusiastic and willing to obey his orders. Pigres was also proactive and had suggestions, perhaps because he used to be a merchant before becoming a slave, so he had a more meticulous mindset. Cornelius, on the other hand, seemed indifferent, maybe because of his old age and not wanting to bother anymore…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Therefore, Maximus was somewhat dissatisfied with Cornelius as a leader, but he didn’t have a better candidate at the moment, so he could only wait and see. It was also because of this that he decided to bring a group of children into his room to rest, not only to care for their physical well-being but also because the children had better learning abilities. He needed to provide them with intensive guidance so they could become useful as soon as possible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ……………………………………………………\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the early morning, Maximus woke up and didn’t disturb the still sleeping children. He then went alone to the kitchen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The kitchen was filled with smoke, and dozens of people were busy. Some were tending to the fire, others were cooking porridge, kneading dough, or baking… Although the Logistics Team had renovated the kitchen and opened up a few adjacent rooms, it still felt crowded. The room was unbearably hot, and sweat soaked through the thin clothes. Some people even worked shirtless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Amidst all the noise, Agnes’ voice rose above the rest as she stood in the center of the kitchen, waving her hands and loudly directing her subordinates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus stood at the door for a while, then turned and returned to the main building, climbing up to the rooftop on the third floor to look around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When the Rebel Army first arrived here, the area around the farm was lush and green. Orderly rows of trees were covered with grapevines, adorned with clusters of small grapes like green pearls. However, now, the trees and grapevines had already been cut down by the soldiers. The messy and haphazardly placed tents of various sizes and shapes, as well as rudimentary huts made of wood, scattered across the dark brown soil, extending from the vicinity of the farm to the distance. There were no earth walls or fences around the tents. In the open spaces between the tents, many people were lying fast asleep. It didn’t resemble a military camp at all, but rather a refugee camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was precisely because of the disorder in the military camp that Spartacus recently abandoned resting in the farm and instead lived directly in the camp, enduring hardships with the soldiers. Many gladiators, such as Crixus and Artorix, followed suit and learned from him, so the relationship between the gladiators and the slaves who joined the Rebel Army later was harmonious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, discipline within the army remained an issue. Just like now, the members of the Logistics Team placed some prepared breakfast on wooden carts and as soon as they passed the farm’s gate, people in the camp rushed over, frantically grabbing the food like greedy pigs. Even though the officers shouted loudly to stop them, it was of little use. Only when the patrol teams arrived and used sticks to strike them did they barely manage to maintain order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus looked at the chaotic scene at the farm’s gate and sighed inwardly:\n    <em>\n     I hope that the upcoming military training can train these ignorant and unruly slaves into a competent army!\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing breakfast, Maximus took the children to the warehouse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cornelius, who was taking a stroll after breakfast to aid digestion, saw them and asked in surprise, “Captain, what are you doing here?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Don’t you need more people here? I brought them to help,” Maximus said, pointing to the children behind him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Them?! What do a bunch of children know? They’ll only cause trouble. No, no, no!” Cornelius shook his head repeatedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “No one is born with knowledge. Although they are young, their arithmetic skills are better than others. As long as you teach them a bit more, once they learn, it will make your job easier in the future,” Maximus’s words made Cornelius somewhat intrigued.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking the opportunity given by Maximus, Akgo spoke up, “Grandpa Cornelius, we will listen to you attentively and work earnestly!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Let me make it clear beforehand, if anyone doesn’t listen or follow orders, I will send them back, and they won’t be allowed to come again. Understand?!” Cornelius’ words didn’t frighten the children. They excitedly nodded their heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the children being led into the warehouse by Cornelius, Maximus turned around and left with relief.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 23": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 23 – Discussing Agriculture\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    Even though these children ranged from the eldest at 14 years old to the youngest at only 10 years old, Maximus didn’t feel like he was exploiting child labor by making them work at such a young age. After all, this wasn’t the developed modern society, but the ancient Western world dominated by Romans. Here, they didn’t have carefree childhoods, but only suffering and oppression. If they didn’t want to become mere beasts earning money for their slave owners, they had to grow up quickly and bravely fight for survival.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Returning to the front yard, Maximus saw Pigres leading the wagon drivers, guiding the horses as they were about to leave through the gate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Be careful out there and come back safely!” Maximus reminded them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Captain, only the members of the First Team are going out today. The other three teams are said to be staying here,” Pigres whispered, sounding somewhat puzzled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     We have just discussed this yesterday and today they already started implementing it. Spartacus really moves fast…\n    </em>\n    Maximus thought to himself, comfortingly saying, “It’s fine. This will be the norm from now on. One team goes out, and the other teams will train in the camp.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After Pigres left, Maximus climbed up to the rooftop of the main building once again. From there, he observed the gladiators who were serving as squad leaders in the camp surrounding the farm. They were shouting, cursing, beating, and kicking while directing their new recruits. The squad leaders then handed each of them a wooden stick and instructed them to diligently strike the tree stumps that had already been felled…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The practice of striking the wooden stumps was the basic training for gladiators, and now it was being applied to the new recruits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus really wanted to go to the camp and observe the training of the new recruits, but he had other matters to attend to at the moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vorenus entered the room and saw Maximus sitting at the edge of the bed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vorenus had only joined the rebellion two days ago, and the only high-ranking member he knew was this young man. When he recounted his own experiences in the courtyard the other night, the comforting words from this young man had left a favorable impression on him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Vorenus could even greet him, Maximus stood up and approached him. “Vo…Vorenus, you’re here. Please, have a seat.” He guided Vorenus to sit on the edge of the bed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Um… Captain, is there something you want to discuss with me?” Vorenus asked, surprised and honored by the attention.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “You served as overseer of a farm for many years, so I assume you have a good understanding of farm affairs,” Maximus said, looking at him expectantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I wouldn’t dare say I know everything, but I’m quite familiar with anything I’ve been in charge of,” Vorenus answered cautiously, unsure why Maximus was asking these questions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “That’s great. I have some questions I’d like to consult with you.” Maximus picked up a stack of papyrus from the nearby wooden table, flipped through a few pages, and then focused his gaze on it. He asked, “When you normally cultivate the land, do you use fertilizers? And where do these fertilizers come from?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vorenus didn’t expect the young man to ask about this, so he paused for a moment and then replied, “Of course, we use fertilizers. Even the most fertile land will experience reduced yields after several crops, so we must replenish the nutrients in the soil.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “There are several types of fertilizers. The best one is bird droppings, but they are scarce and insufficient. I’ve heard that in the Latium region, there are farms specifically dedicated to raising thrushes and bullfinches for collecting and selling bird droppings, and the prices are not low… Next is human manure, followed by sheep manure and donkey manure. Horse manure is the least preferred, but it is suitable for pastures…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “After collecting the manure, it cannot be immediately used in the fields, or else the wheat seedlings will die. It needs to be made into a manure heap and protected from excessive exposure to the sun. After a period of time, it can be spread in the fields, which will result in bountiful crops. Many farms have manure heaps nearby. I don’t know if you have noticed them, Captain…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vorenus spoke confidently, while Maximus was deeply shocked:\n    <em>\n     It seems that the contents in this book are true. The method of using manure to fertilize crops is not unique to our Chinese ancestors but was also practiced by the Romans. Although they may not have understood the underlying principles, they have discovered this method through practical experience to promote abundant harvests.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus regained his composure, turned a few more pages, and continued to ask, “This book mentions that the highest value produced by planting crops on 100 jugers (around 62 acres) of land is from grapes for making wine, followed by irrigated vegetable gardens, then willow groves, fruit orchards, and pastures, with grains being the least profitable… Why is the profit from cultivating grains so low?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without hesitation, Vorenus replied, “Captain, the reason is simple. Nowadays, there is a large quantity of grain flowing into Italy from provinces such as Sicily, Africa, Asia Minor, and even Egypt… The grain merchants from these provinces, under the pressure of Rome, have set very low grain prices. As a result, the grains grown by the Italian population, apart from their own consumption, are sold at a loss in the market. Therefore, most wealthy individuals do not grow grains but instead cultivate grapes, fruit trees, and olives, and engage in animal husbandry… That’s how they can make money. The reason there are still some wheat fields in Campania is that the land here is fertile, resulting in high grain yields, and the neighboring Samnites in the mountains are in great need of food, providing some profit.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “So you’re saying that the influx of grain from various Roman provinces into Italy is the main reason for the widespread bankruptcy of farmers in Italian towns?” Maximus continued to inquire.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The farmers throughout Italy? This… I’m not too sure about that, but I do know that in Capua, some farmers have accumulated debts and lost their land because of this. Farming not only requires seeds but also a lot of tools, such as oxen, horses, plows, hoes, sickles… Farmers cannot make these things themselves; they need to buy them from the market. However, if their grains cannot be sold, they cannot earn money to purchase these tools and can only borrow money from others. If there is a drought and the grain harvest is bad, they even need to borrow money to buy seeds for the next year.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “However, the money they borrowed is all from usurers! It accumulates more and more, and in the end, they can only sell their land to repay the debt. Some people sell their land, but it’s still not enough, so they have to sell themselves… Sigh, it’s not easy for farmers nowadays!” Vorenus sighed heavily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although Maximus had already pondered over this issue, there was still a sense of joy in his heart because the author of this book was Cato, as mentioned in the self-introduction on the front page. He was certain that it was the same Cato who constantly cursed the Carthage. Even though this book was written in Cato’s later years, around 30 to 40 years ago, it meant that the plight of Italian farmers had already emerged back then.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus let out a gentle sigh, glanced at the papyrus in his hand, and asked in a deep voice, “This book also mentions the practice of continuously mating male and female slaves like livestock, and then training their children from a young age to be sold… Is there really someone engaged in such a slave industry?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vorenus fell silent for a moment and replied, “I have heard my former master talk about it. There are indeed nobles in Rome involved in this kind of slave trade because captured slaves are often disobedient. Homebred slaves with skills are more desirable, and naturally, they command higher prices… In fact, I am a homebred slave myself because my parents were originally slaves of my master’s household.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although in these past few days, Maximus had witnessed and heard about various cruel exploitations and oppressions carried out by slave owners during this era, he had grown somewhat accustomed to it. Yet, at this moment, he still felt a heavy discomfort in his chest. In his previous life, he had learned about this Roman senator, Cato, who had been consistently shouting “Carthage must be destroyed.” Although he was known for his stubbornness, he was a follower of\n    <em>\n     Stoicism\n    </em>\n    , leading a simple and modest life, and emphasizing reason and equality for all. However, looking at what he wrote in this book:\n    <em>\n     “…the tools used on the farm are divided into two types: those who can speak and those who cannot, and slaves belong to the speaking ones…”\n    </em>\n    and so on, even Cato had such views, let alone other Roman patricians.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     This evil slave society!\n    </em>\n    Maximus couldn’t help but curse in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Cap…Captain, what book is that in your hand?” Vorenus cautiously asked out of curiosity.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “This is\n    <em>\n     De Agri Cultura\n    </em>\n    written by Marcus Porcius Cato. I found it in one of the rooms after we captured this farm,” Maximus replied, handing over the papyrus in his hand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The Cato family from Rome? I’ve heard my former master talk about them. This Roman family is known for their expertise in agricultural management!” Vorenus said with a look of joy as he eagerly started reading the papyrus.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 24": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 24 – The Roman Legion Is Coming\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    Maximus blinked his eyes. “Can you read?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I can read a little.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Do you know arithmetic?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I know a little.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     To be able to manage a farm, it’s not just about knowing how to read and do arithmetic!\n    </em>\n    Maximus looked at the hardworking Vorenus and realized that he was a rare talent in the Logistics Team. If he were to replace Cornelius and manage the warehouse, it would be a waste of talent. After thinking for a moment, Maximus said, “Vorenus, starting today, you don’t need to go to the kitchen anymore. Stay by my side and help me handle the affairs of the entire Logistics Team.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Huh?” Vorenus raised his head in surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as Maximus was about to speak, someone barged into the room. “C-Captain, Commander Spartacus has asked for you to attend a meeting!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus saw that it was Pigres who came in and asked in astonishment, “Why did you come back so early?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The… the Roman army is coming!” Pigres gasped for breath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus was taken aback.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vorenus’ hand trembled, and the papyrus he was holding fell to the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ………………………………………………………\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Omarkel’s men have discovered the Roman army and saw them entering Naples. There is no doubt that they are coming for us. So, as soon as I received the news, I immediately returned with the First Team.” Spartacus explained the situation to everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “How many Roman soldiers are there?” Crixus asked anxiously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “There are about 2,000 to 3,000 men. They are fully armed, holding the eagle standard high, and they also have hundreds of cavalry.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Is it 2,000 or 3,000 soldiers? Can you be more specific?!” Hamilcar asked impatiently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Hamilcar, not everyone has a talent for arithmetic like you. Omarkel’s men were loyal to their duty and dared to extend their reconnaissance beyond the Vesuvius region. They discovered the trace of the Roman army in a timely manner and made a rough estimate of their numbers. That’s already quite good!” Spartacus defended the cavalry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I understand that, but the difference between 2,000 and 3,000 is a thousand men, and that can significantly affect our tactical planning.” Hamilcar was getting anxious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Regardless of how many of them come, as long as the Romans dare to show up here, we’ll charge at them and crush them all, just like we did at the Temple of Flora!” Oenomaus fiercely said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “According to what Spartacus said, this army that has come should be a Roman legion, far superior to the Capuan city guards. They are well-equipped and even have cavalry. As for us, we have less than five hundred people with actual weapons, while the rest either have sticks or farming tools. How can we face off against a Roman legion?” Artorix’s face revealed concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Sticks can kill people just like any weapon. Furthermore, we have many more people than them. When the time comes, we’ll charge together and surround the Romans. Even if they have powerful weapons, they won’t be able to unleash their full force. In the end, they will only be killed by us, just like when we escaped from the gladiator school!” Crixus said confidently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “For gladiators like you and me who have undergone long-term training, using sticks to kill people is indeed easy. However, most of our men are used to handling hoes and farming tools. They haven’t received training, and they would hesitate even to kill a person. How can they have the courage to fight against the Roman army?!” Artorix reminded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “If that’s what you’re saying, then why don’t we just surrender when the Romans arrive!” Crixus mocked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “My men are not afraid of the Romans. When they arrive, I will lead the charge and show them the might of my Third Team!” Oenomaus said with a proud expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Enough arguing!” Spartacus looked at everyone sternly, signaling for them to quiet down. He spoke in a deep voice, “Don’t forget that our motto is ‘Resist Rome and fight for freedom’. The slaves who have joined us believe in us, and that’s why they joined our ranks. So, this battle is unavoidable, and we have prepared for it, haven’t we? However, what Artorix said does need our attention. The Roman army is coming too quickly, and our troops lack training and don’t have enough weapons. If we engage them head-on, we will certainly be at a disadvantage. My suggestion is——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus paused for a moment, pondering before continuing, “…we will first wait quietly for the Romans to attack, then position our entire army with our back against the camp and the mountain. The camp is now the home of our brothers, and they will surely fight bravely to defend it. This way, we can also prevent the Roman cavalry from flanking us and undermining the morale of our brothers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We will defend from a high position while the Romans have to attack from below. Even if the slope is not very steep, they are wearing heavy armor and have to climb, prevent themselves from falling, and engage in battle. They won’t be able to fully utilize their attacking capabilities, and they will easily tire. As long as we withstand their initial attack, we will gain the advantage!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus’ words rejuvenated everyone’s spirits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “But the Romans are not fools. If they see us adopting this formation, they probably won’t rashly attack,” Artorix objected.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “You don’t have to worry about that. Even if they see us forming up with our backs against the mountain, the Romans will definitely attack,” Hamilcar explained. “I’ve served in the Roman army before and have some understanding of them. The Romans are currently the rulers of the Mediterranean, and to them, we are nothing more than lowly slaves. If this Roman army faces us, who have no armor and lack weapons, and they still don’t dare to attack, they will only be ridiculed by other Romans.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “What Spartacus said makes sense. Let’s do it!” Crixus expressed his agreement loudly, and no one raised any objections.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So Spartacus continued, “Before the Roman army attacks, our forces must not descend from the mountain to prevent being ambushed by the Romans. We need to use our time wisely to train our brothers, at least to teach them how to form formations and understand the commands for attack. Omarkel’s reconnaissance team should constantly monitor the movements of the Roman army and report back to the camp.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Maximus,” Hamilcar then said, “starting from today until we fight against the Romans, I want you to increase the amount of meat in the rations for the soldiers, so they can eat their fill at every meal. That way, they will have enough energy for training and battle.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Understood, I will make sure Agnes and the others work hard on it,” Maximus immediately responded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “That’s it then. Everyone, go back and train your troops as soon as possible,” Spartacus concluded the meeting decisively.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the people left the hall, Maximus was the last to leave. Throughout the entire meeting, he had not voiced any opinions, but he had been pondering one question: What should he do in the first battle between Spartacus’ rebel army and the Roman army?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In his past life, there were only a few sparse historical records about the Spartacus rebellion, but it had inspired numerous novels and movies, each with different plots. However, there were a few key moments that remained consistent…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Subconsciously, Maximus looked through the window of the hall and gazed at the mountain behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ……………………………………………………\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For two consecutive days, the rebel army intensified their training in preparation for the upcoming battle. However, the Roman army remained unseen, and Omarkel’s reconnaissance team had not received any information. Once they entered the vicinity of Naples, they would be intercepted by Roman cavalry. Some Roman cavalry even roamed near the vineyard at the foot of the mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the morning of the third day, while Maximus was in the bedroom asking Vorenus how to herd sheep and grow fodder, he suddenly heard the long blaring sound of a horn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Wooo!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     The Romans are here?!\n    </em>\n    Maximus immediately stood up and rushed out of the bedroom and out of the farm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The camp outside was already in a frenzy, and under the shouting of the squad leaders, the soldiers noisily began to gather…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus sprinted through the camp and saw Hamilcar standing on a large boulder on the hillside, looking westward.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 25": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 25 – Before the Battle\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    Maximus hurriedly approached Hamilcar’s side. Hamilcar glanced at him, then looked ahead and said, “The Romans are here.” Despite Hamilcar’s efforts to appear calm, Maximus could still hear the tension in his voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus looked into the distance and saw Roman cavalry in groups of ten, advancing in a fan-shaped formation towards the vineyard. In the far distance, a long line of soldiers was approaching. Two standard-bearers led the way, draped in wolf skins and holding eagle emblems and flags. Behind them were several trumpeters carrying long horns, followed by Roman legionnaires. They marched in five parallel columns, each wearing a red waistcoat, a Gallic-style helmet, and segmented armor, and carrying a large red shield in their left hand and a heavy javelin in their right. They had a short Roman sword on their left side and a short dagger on their right… They walked with their heads held high, exuding an imposing aura. This was not just a simple march, but a force ready for battle. At the end of the long line, there were several auxiliary soldiers wearing leather helmets and chainmail, armed with long spears and large shields. Even the equipment of these less valued Roman auxiliaries far surpassed that of the majority of rebel soldiers. The whole formation was followed by a dozen or so wagons and some army slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Roman army, with their shining helmets and bright armor, sparkled in the sunlight, emitting a dazzling light…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar and Maximus squinted their eyes, holding their breath, and stood still, observing for quite a while.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar exclaimed angrily, “There are more than just 2,000 or 3,000 men. It has already exceeded 4,000!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “About 4,300,” Maximus said with certainty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I must quickly inform Spartacus!” Hamilcar turned and ran towards the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus remained standing, continuing to observe the advancing Roman army. They were not moving at a fast pace. It took about half an hour for them to approach the olive oil farm, which was about 1.5 kilometers away. By this time, the rebel forces had roughly completed their formation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus, Crixus, and several other leaders also arrived near Maximus to observe the enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar pulled Maximus aside and whispered in his ear, “As the leader of the Logistics Team, you should stay with your subordinates at a time like this instead of wandering around here!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus was alert, realizing that he had been too curious about the Roman legion and had momentarily forgotten his duty. He quickly apologized and humbly asked for advice, “Teacher, I was wrong! What should I do now?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar looked serious and said, “The Logistics Team consists mainly of women, elderly, and children. You should gather them together and comfort them! And…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He lowered his voice and said, “You need to prepare the wagons and load them with some food, just in case——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar didn’t continue, but Maximus understood his meaning. He nodded solemnly and turned around to run back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rebel formation was right behind him, with the majority of the front row consisting of gladiators, all fully armed. Maximus heard several people calling his name, but he didn’t have time to respond.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As Maximus hurried back to the farm, the Roman army, passing by the olive oil farm, had already stopped their advance. They faced the rebel forces and began to prepare for formation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From the hill, Spartacus looked down at the scene and said with a serious expression, “The Romans are preparing to attack!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Our brothers are ready and waiting for them to come and die!” Oenomaus enthusiastically declared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gladiators behind him took the opportunity to roar, rallying the other rebel soldiers. “HRAAAH!! HRAAAH!!” The morale of the rebel forces soared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Roman army remained unfazed, calmly forming their ranks. They had been marching in an organized formation, with their entire force moving horizontally. Each large unit gradually gathered, forming the traditional Roman checkerboard formation. Their formation speed was much faster than that of the rebel army. However, strangely enough, the auxiliary soldiers at the rear of their formation broke away and dropped their weapons. They walked toward the wagons parked behind the formation and took out shovels, hoes, and other digging tools stored inside. They surrounded the olive oil farm and started digging.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This peculiar action puzzled Spartacus and the others: The auxiliary soldiers in this Roman army numbered over a thousand, accounting for more than a quarter of the entire force. Instead of participating in the battle, they were digging. What were they up to?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a while, the Roman legion completed its formation but remained stationary. Meanwhile, the sweating auxiliary soldiers had already dug a shallow trench, encircling the olive oil farm. The soil they excavated was used to build earthworks inside the trench.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar suddenly realized, “The Romans are constructing a camp!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Will they still attack us?” Artorix immediately asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The Roman army has a habit of building temporary camps on the battlefield. This way, if they are defeated, they can take refuge inside and defend themselves to ensure their safety. I never expected them to be so cautious even when facing us. Perhaps once they finish building, they will launch an attack against us.” Spartacus said, recalling his experience fighting with the Roman army in Asia Minor and having some understanding of their tactics.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “So, how long do we have to wait? Why not take the initiative and attack them now while the Romans have fewer troops?” Oenomaus impatiently suggested.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Since we have already formulated a battle plan in advance, we should execute it according to the plan!” Spartacus said in a deep voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Crixus, who usually boasted of his bravery, agreed with Spartacus’ opinion at this moment. Seeing the well-organized Roman army below the hill, he felt a bit intimidated.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a result, the rebel army continued to wait silently on the slope, while the Roman legion remained motionless below, with only the Roman auxiliary soldiers toiling away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As time passed, the clamor within the rebel army grew louder. The once dense formation gradually became sparse. The soldiers chatted and joked to alleviate the tension. Some even sat down on the ground due to the scorching sun and prolonged standing. Spartacus and his comrades had to hurry to their respective units, doing their best to inspire the soldiers and maintain their dwindling morale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Similar circumstances occurred within the Roman army, but the veteran officers performed more efficiently, resulting in the soldiers displaying better discipline.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both sides stood facing each other, several miles apart, until noon. By then, the trench behind the Roman army had been mostly dug, and the earthen wall had been erected, complete with designated entrances and exits. Roman commander Glaber gave the order, and the Roman soldiers began withdrawing one by one into the earthen wall and the olive oil farm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Roman army didn’t launch the attack Spartacus had anticipated, which disappointed him. However, when he saw the rebel soldiers lying and resting on the ground behind him, he couldn’t help but feel relieved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although no battle took place that day, the Roman army had come dangerously close. This made the rebel forces nervous, prompting Spartacus and his comrades to hold another urgent meeting. After discussing, they decided to temporarily continue with their original plan and wait for the Romans to attack. But at the same time, they would strengthen the camp’s defenses to prevent enemy sneak attacks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the Roman side, Glaber also feared a sneak attack from the rebels. He ordered the auxiliary soldiers to continue setting traps and constructing palisades outside the trench. He also arranged multiple patrols within the camp to keep watch throughout the night.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although it was an uneventful day, many people didn’t sleep well, including Maximus. After all, whether in his past life or the present one, it was his first experience of war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But as the rooster crowed at dawn, Maximus immediately got up and headed to the kitchen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without any need for his urging, Agnes had already led her team to busy themselves because they were well aware that if the rebel army suffered a defeat, they could face dire consequences. The only thing they could do was to quickly prepare delicious food, ensuring the soldiers ate their fill and had abundant strength to fight the enemy.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 26": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 26 – Battle Begins\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    The kitchen was filled with a tense atmosphere. Maximus stayed inside for a while but had to step out to avoid getting in the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, he suddenly felt a little lost: He had come to this time period and decided to change the fate of his and Spartacus’ rebel army being ultimately destroyed. However, when it came time to fight the Roman army, he could only watch from the sidelines, waiting quietly for the outcome of the battle, unable to contribute in any way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     If only I could command an army into battle!\n    </em>\n    This thought suddenly arose in Maximus’ mind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Lost in his thoughts, Maximus saw a few figures passing by in front of him. He immediately snapped back to reality and shouted, “Akgo, Cassius, what are you doing?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “T-Teacher, we wanted to help in the kitchen,” Akgo stammered in response.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The title “teacher” was what Maximus had them call him, and considering his efforts in teaching the children, he indeed deserved the title.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Didn’t I tell you that you can’t wander around during this critical time? You must stay with Uncle Vorenus! This way, if something happens, I can find you at any time. Understand?” Maximus said sternly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We also wanted to contribute…” Cassius explained softly, but Maximus gave him a stern gaze, causing him to lower his head immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Teacher, we were wrong. We’ll go back now. Please don’t be angry!” Nasya quickly apologized, and the other children quickly agreed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus’ expression softened, and he nodded. “Since it’s your first offense, I’ll forgive you this time.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The children held great respect for Maximus, and they didn’t want to make him angry, so they obediently turned and headed back to the main building. Maximus followed behind and arrived at the front courtyard, where he coincidentally met Pigres.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Captain, should we still move everything into the wagons like we did yesterday?” Pigris asked eagerly upon seeing him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Of course,” Maximus replied without hesitation. Seeing Pigres’ slight confusion, he added, “We must prepare for the worst and hope for the best.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With Maximus’ words, Pigres’ emotions settled a bit, and he led his subordinates to carry the supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus then went up to the rooftop of the main building. After a while, he saw the kitchen staff pushing a cart loaded with steaming food, leaving through the main gate of the farm. In the past, soldiers would rush to grab the food, causing a chaotic scene at the entrance. However, this time, they were nowhere to be seen, and the food cart smoothly made its way towards the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the surface, this seemed like a good thing, but Maximus felt uneasy. He had actually hoped that today would be like any other day, indicating that the rebel soldiers were not affected by the arrival of the Roman army yesterday. However, he realized that he also hadn’t given his usual lectures to the Logistics Team last night. It seemed that everyone, himself included, was a novice to the anxiety and tension of the real war.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Realizing this, Maximus struggled to calm himself down because, as the leader of the Logistics Team, his every move would affect the morale of his subordinates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After having breakfast, Maximus ordered Saxippus to herd the cattle and sheep to the back of the farm, and then gathered the rest of the Logistics Team inside the farm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By this time, the sky was already bright, and the sun hung low in the clear sky.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Woo! Woo! Woo!” The sound of trumpets urgently rang out in the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     Are the Romans finally attacking?!\n    </em>\n    Maximus went up to the rooftop again and looked ahead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the distance, fully armed Roman soldiers were orderly marching out of the newly constructed camp from yesterday, directly lining up in the fields…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After about half an hour, the Roman legion had formed the traditional three-line formation, and behind this formation were auxiliary troops in a more dense formation. Following the auxiliary troops were ten wagons, with 50 cavalry on each flank.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The brass horn whistled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Roman army slowly began to advance towards the rebel camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     It seems that this time the Romans are really going to attack!\n    </em>\n    Maximus felt nervous, and he shifted his gaze to the nearby area.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the Roman soldiers marched out of the camp, the rebel army also began to move. In fact, after finishing breakfast, the rebel soldiers had already been on standby in the camp. Though the formation still seemed noisy and chaotic, having experienced it once yesterday made the process faster. Just as the Roman army approached the foot of the mountain, the rebel army had already completed their formation… This relieved Maximus slightly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then he saw Spartacus, who was in the front row of the formation, walking to the front and speaking loudly. Then, the gladiators in the front row of the formation brandished their swords and spears, roaring in unison. The new recruits were also influenced and began to join in the shouting. Eventually, the entire rebel army’s formation resounded with roars…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although most of the slaves who joined the rebel army were still dressed in simple clothes, holding hoes, pitchforks, and wooden sticks… their hatred for the Romans had been stirred, causing them to no longer tremble and fear when facing the well-equipped Roman army. Instead, their eyes were filled with anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even Maximus, who was in the rear, felt the change in morale and couldn’t help but have a little more hope for victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, at this moment, the Roman army stopped its advance. They began to adjust their somewhat disorderly formation at the foot of the mountain, and from each wagon, three or four soldiers jumped out. They each carried a wooden frame and placed them in the gaps of the formation, then started to busy themselves around the frames.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “What are those things they placed in front of their formation?!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Why aren’t these Roman bastards attacking?!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldiers behind Spartacus whispered among themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “That’s the Roman ballista!” Spartacus spoke loudly to clarify for the soldiers, dispelling their suspicions: “It’s like a slingshot children play with, but instead of small stones, it launches projectiles. However, its accuracy is not great, so hitting the target is difficult…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both in expression and tone, Spartacus appeared relaxed, but deep down, he started to feel uneasy:\n    <em>\n     How could I forget that the Romans would use this tactic in a pitched battle?\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Report to the legatus, all ballistae are installed and awaiting your orders!” Vettinius saluted and reported to Glaber.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I understand.” Glaber looked at the camp commander before him, a man in his 50s. He was a veteran he appointed against all objections. He was once a centurion under Sulla, with an outstanding record in the wars in Asia Minor. Since Vettinius’ appointment, everything from marching, training, camping, and military discipline had been meticulously arranged by him, rewarding Glaber’s trust in him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “According to the previous plan, let these ignorant slaves witness the horrors of war!” Glaber disdainfully pointed towards the rebel army on the mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Roman ballistae operators, following the orders, began to turn the handles. The double-layered spring arms were pulled backward with the string and then secured onto the metal hook, then a lead ball was placed on the track.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This was a small lead ball that weighed only half a talent (a standard ballista projectile weighs about one Attic talent, approximately 26 kilograms). This was done to increase its flight distance. Unlike usual projectiles, it was wrapped in oiled cloth. Once ignited, the ballista operators quickly pulled the trigger. The sound of “whoosh, whoosh!” filled the air as ten fireball projectiles shot out, flying over 500 meters and soaring above the rebel army’s formation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Most of the rebel soldiers breathed a sigh of relief, but Spartacus was suddenly startled. He hadn’t expected the ballistae to fire fireballs instead of lead projectiles. And these fireballs were landing not far from the rebel camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rebel camp was not well-planned, with no clear spacing between the tents and no fire prevention measures. Moreover, it was early summer, hot weather, and the items were dry. As the fireballs fell into the camp, the tents immediately ignited…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus saw five or six fires erupting around the farm and was momentarily stunned. He realized the danger and hurriedly rushed downstairs, shouting at Agnes, Pigres, and others in the front yard, “Quick! Take people to the camp and extinguish the fire! Go put out the fire!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus led the members of the Logistics Team hurriedly towards the camp but forgot to inform Spartacus.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 27": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 27 – Engaging in Battle\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    The soldiers of the rebel army became alarmed when they saw the camp behind them catch fire. Even Hamilcar felt a sense of tension. He anxiously asked Spartacus beside him, “The Romans are very cunning. They are attempting to burn our camp and undermine our morale. If this continues, I’m afraid… Should we change our plan and launch an attack in advance?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Don’t panic. The original plan remains unchanged. We will continue to wait,” Spartacus replied calmly. He then said in a deep voice, “Immediately send someone to inform Maximus to lead his team and extinguish the fire.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Understood!” Hamilcar’s heart settled a bit. He knew that although he had experienced some battles, he found it difficult to remain as calm and composed as Spartacus during critical moments. That was also the main reason why he was willing to assist Spartacus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Continue the bombardment! Don’t stop!” Glaber looked up at the flames on the mountain ahead and gave a loud order. Although he was only permitted to bring half a legion, due to his cautious nature, he stubbornly insisted on obtaining more ballistae and cavalry. Originally, it was to intimidate the enemy, who were mostly slaves, during confrontations. However, after the cavalry discovered the enemy camp’s layout, he formulated this battle plan, which seemed to be effective now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Overhead, fireballs flew sporadically and shouts from the Logistics Team behind the rebel army continued to be heard. The rebel soldiers kept turning their heads to look back, their emotions fluctuating like a roller coaster. The initial high morale had vanished, and the once dense formation gradually became loose, with the noise growing louder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus remained standing motionless, fully focused on overlooking the Roman ballistae position below the mountain. Suddenly, he spoke up, “One of the ballistae hasn’t launched a fireball for two rounds! Oh, it looks like the one next to it has also stopped!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar followed his gaze and indeed confirmed it. He felt a surge of joy and said, “It seems they’re malfunctioning!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Ballistae being damaged by fire is to be expected!” Spartacus relaxed his furrowed brow and shouted, “Brothers, hold on a little longer! The Roman ballistae will soon all be rendered useless, and then they will have no choice but to come up the mountain and fight us!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As he shouted, Hamilcar echoed him, and the nearby gladiators joined in as well. The soldiers in the center gradually regained their composure. However, it was at this moment that a roar erupted from the left flank. The rebel soldiers there rushed down towards the Roman army below like a roaring torrent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar was taken aback by this situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus angrily exclaimed, “What is happening?! What is Oenomaus doing?!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he finished speaking, a similar roar erupted from the right flank, and then the soldiers followed suit and charged down the mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Damn it! Crixus——” Spartacus’ cursing abruptly stopped as he raised his short sword and shouted with all his might, “Brothers, take revenge against the Romans, charge with me!” After speaking, he wielded his sword and shield, leading the way as he rushed down the mountain. In this situation, Spartacus couldn’t possibly watch the left and right flanks fight the Roman army themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldiers shouted, “REVENGE!! REVENGE!!!” as they eagerly charged down. Another thousand-man unit led by Artorix followed closely behind in the center.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The successive descent of the rebel army caught the attention of Maximus, who was uneasy about this sudden change in the battle plan. He looked around and saw the Logistics Team personnel scattered throughout the camp, extinguishing fires.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He hesitated briefly before making a decision: “Hurry up and gather here, everyone! Quick!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ………………………………………………..\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glaber couldn’t help but feel nervous when he saw the fierce rebel army charging down from the mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the other hand, the camp commander, Vettinius, remained calm. He commanded the officers to shout loudly, quickly merging the small formations of hundred-man squads (centuria) into a large formation, approximately 300 meters long and ten columns wide. Behind the formation were around 1,000 auxiliary troops (with another 300 auxiliary troops guarding the camp). Glaber had not deployed these auxiliary troops to obstruct the rebel army’s charge because he lacked confidence in these hastily conscripted city guards from Naples and surrounding towns. He was worried that these poorly trained Campanians would not provide assistance in the face of a direct confrontation and might even become a burden.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as the Roman legion finished merging their formations, the rebel army’s left and right flanks were already closing in on the front of their formation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Javelin! Javelin!” The Roman officers’ shouts prompted the soldiers to quickly assume throwing positions. Following the officers, they threw heavy javelins at the enemy with their right hands. Although they were pressed for time and their actions were not precise, the concentrated volley of thousands of heavy javelins was disastrous for the inexperienced and poorly protected rebel soldiers. Amidst a chorus of screams, countless rebel soldiers were pierced by the heavy javelins and fell to the ground. The once dense formation suddenly became sparse. Some rebel soldiers who narrowly avoided the javelin attack turned and fled, while others, though still advancing, noticeably slowed down. Only the gladiators in the front line continued their relentless charge.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If it were a seasoned Roman legion achieved such a great result with the javelin attack, they would undoubtedly take advantage of the situation and launch a full assault, completely disrupting the enemy’s formation. However, the Roman army before them clearly had no such intention. Instead, under the leadership of the officers, they raised their shields, drew their short swords, and assumed a defensive posture. Although they had dealt a heavy blow to the enemy, they couldn’t help but feel nervous when facing the fierce charging gladiators.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The onslaught of javelins and the significant reduction in the number of comrades did not make the gladiators on the left and right flanks hesitate. On the contrary, the worsening situation on the battlefield made their blood boil. They roared loudly, their faces were ferocious like wild beasts. Battle and death were their destiny, just as in the arena.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Oenomaus and Crixus were the kings of these beasts. They charged at the forefront, effortlessly holding their large shields impaled with heavy javelins as easy as holding a piece of cloth. With the momentum, they forcefully rammed their shields against the shield defense of the Roman soldiers, the powerful impact caused their opponents to stagger. Then, with lightning speed, their right-hand short swords penetrated the gaps exposed by the shields, injuring their foes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soon after, the central units of the rebel army, led by Spartacus and Artorix, also reached the front of the Roman formation, inflicting casualties on the first line of Roman soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Roman formation became somewhat disordered, causing Glaber, who was in the rear, to feel anxious. He couldn’t help but shout, “Quickly, let the Campanian soldiers——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Don’t worry, Legatus,” Vettinius reassured loudly, “our soldiers can hold their ground!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Is… is that so?” Vettinius’ words calmed Glaber’s emotions slightly. He remained mounted on his horse, observing the situation ahead. Amidst the shouts of the officers, some of the panicked soldiers instinctively followed the orders and pressed closer to each other. Some of the front-line soldiers even abandoned their short swords and held their shields with both hands, focusing on full defense. As a result, the entire formation contracted inward, becoming denser.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gladiators’ charge was halted; their numbers were still too few. Once engaged in close combat, their attacking power diminished significantly due to the lack of overall coordination. The Roman soldiers began to catch their breath.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was only now that Glaber breathed a sigh of relief and asked in an inquiring tone, “When can we send in the Campanians?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Wait a little longer, let these ignorant slaves exhaust their stamina. By then, they won’t have the energy to run,” Vettinius replied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Alright, let’s do that,” Glaber agreed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus gathered his strength and fiercely rammed into the Roman soldiers in front of him many times. However, the opponents defended with full force, using long shields to guard their bodies without launching a counterattack. This made it difficult for Spartacus to find an opening to strike and injure them. Moreover, due to the loose formation of the rebel army and the forced retreat of the Romans, Spartacus found himself embedded among the enemy, with enemies on both sides. This made him hesitant to launch another all-out attack, and frustration rose within him:\n    <em>\n     These damned Romans are like turtles, we can’t break through their formation quickly, what do we do?! Our brothers on both left and right wings have been attacked by javelins earlier and their strength is weakened. How much longer can they hold on?!\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 28": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 28 – Rout\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    After seeing all the rebel soldiers charge down the mountain, Maximus stopped putting out the fire and intently observed the situation unfolding below: the Romans’ javelin attack made his heart race, the gladiators’ charge filled him with excitement, the deadlock between the two sides made him anxious… And then he saw the troops at the back of the Roman formation split into two groups, starting to flank the rebels’ wings. The inexperienced recruits, who wielded farming tools and had never experienced combat, almost instantly collapsed upon seeing enemies attacking from the rear…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     It’s over!\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though Maximus had some expectations based on his memories from his previous life, witnessing the rebel soldiers crying out and fleeing up the mountain in disarray made his scalp tingle and his hands and feet turn cold. It took him a while to regain his composure before urgently shouting, “Agnes! Cornelius! Take your subordinates and quickly retreat up the mountain!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Pigres! The members of your wagon team…get on the wagons and follow them up the mountain!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Vorenus! Children! Follow me!” Maximus ran back while continuously shouting with all his might.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He heard the responses from Agnes, Pigres, and Cornelius coming from the camp. However, at the same time, accompanied by the panicked cries of other members of the Logistics Team, some people rushed toward Maximus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The situation was urgent, and Maximus couldn’t spare a moment to look closely. He hurriedly led them in a hasty retreat towards the rear, up the mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ……………………………………………\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glaber was overjoyed when he saw the enemy in full retreat and immediately gave the order, “Send out the cavalry to pursue the enemy!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Yes!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Legionnaires…” Glaber hesitated for a moment and said, “Maintain formation and advance towards the enemy’s camp at a normal pace. Leave the task of pursuing the fleeing soldiers to the cavalry and auxiliary troops.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glaber’s cautious approach stemmed from his lack of confidence in the combat ability of these newly conscripted Roman soldiers. The gladiators’ charge earlier had left him frightened. He was worried that the Roman soldiers would scatter during the pursuit, and if the gladiators counterattacked, an unexpected situation could arise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vettinius had no objections to this plan.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Roman cavalry and Campanian auxiliary troops pursued from both flanks, forcing the retreating soldiers to flee up the mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the Logistics Team had abandoned their firefighting efforts, several fires reignited in the camp, causing even more panic and confusion among the retreating soldiers. Thus, when many of them looked up and saw hundreds of people from the Logistics Team gathering together and climbing up towards the rear of the mountain, they aimlessly fled toward the rear of the mountain as well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As more and more people followed, the rear of the mountain became the main direction of escape for the fleeing rebel soldiers, including the gladiators. Since they were at the forefront when the battle started, they were left behind when the retreat began. However, they were not like the frightened slaves. As soon as the pursuers approached, they turned around and launched counterattacks. The Roman cavalry and auxiliary troops suffered losses from this encounter and didn’t dare to continue to fight them head-on and chose to bypass them and pursue other fleeing soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By the time the gladiators made their way around the vineyard farm and reached the rear of the mountain, the routed soldiers in front had already been dispersed. The Roman cavalry and auxiliary troops vaguely formed an encirclement around the gladiators.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During the chaotic retreat, the gladiators gradually regrouped, facing the impending encirclement. Although they were tense, they were not panicking. After all, most of them had experienced being surrounded by enemies in group competitions in the arena. Therefore, spurred on by Spartacus’ and Crixus’ loud shouts, they quickly formed a circular formation of hundreds of people and advanced slowly towards the upper part of the rear of the mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The weak Roman cavalry and Campanian auxiliary troops were unable to stop them and had to release the blockade, becoming a trailing force on three sides.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Initially, the slope of the back of the vineyard farm was gentle, but it became steeper and narrower as they ascended. Moreover, the width gradually narrowed. When the gladiators reached a certain height, the slope was no longer wide enough to accommodate their formation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus immediately ordered the circular formation to be transformed into four vertical columns and continued to retreat upward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The trailing Campanian auxiliary troops faced the vigilant gladiators but didn’t dare to launch an attack. It wasn’t until a signal from the rear sounded that they hastily withdrew.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It turned out that Glaber had followed the Roman army to the rebel camp, and when he saw the auxiliary troops confronting the gladiators on the rear of the mountain, in order to avoid losses, he gave the order to withdraw the troops.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At the same time, he summoned a guide who used to be a guard at the vineyard. He had avoided the rebels on the day of the raid by chance when the farm overseer ordered him to go to Naples to buy farm supplies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Besides this side, are there any other paths down the mountain?” Glaber looked up at the mountain and asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “My lord,” the guide respectfully replied, “this mountain, except for this side that has a gentle slope and can barely reach the mountaintop, other areas are exceptionally steep and impossible to climb. Moreover, as you go higher up the mountain, the narrower and steeper the paths become. Only near the mountaintop, there is a plateau that can accommodate a few hundred people. My overseer once opened up a small vineyard there…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Listening, Glaber suddenly asked, “Is there a water source on this mountain?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “No, there is no water source,” the guide understood Glaber’s implication and shook his head. “We built a reservoir in the vineyard up the mountain, but it’s not large enough. Even if it’s filled with water, it wouldn’t be enough for so many people to drink for a day…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glaber was feeling relieved, but he was not completely at ease. He pointed to the mountain and ordered Vettinius, “Immediately recall the auxiliary troops from Campania and have them build a new camp on the mountainside to block the enemy’s path down the mountain and let the legion soldiers maintain vigilance. Additionally, send the cavalry to circle around this mountain and thoroughly examine the terrain, checking if there are any other possible routes down.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We’re not pursuing the fleeing troops?” Vettinius asked reluctantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glaber sneered, “I saw it clearly just now. Those damn gladiators have mostly escaped up the mountain. Once we annihilate them, the other fleeing slaves are not worth mentioning.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “What about the surrendered slaves?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Kill them all to save us from wasting manpower on guarding them.” Glaber sighed lightly, “It’s a pity though, this is just a small slave rebellion. We can’t parade them triumphantly down the streets of Rome after victory!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vettinius, who had participated in the triumphal procession with Sulla in the past, didn’t find it regrettable. He replied, “Legatus, I will proceed with the orders.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ……………………………………………….\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the enemy withdrew, Spartacus did not let his guard down. He and Hamilcar, along with more than 20 gladiators, held the rear and stationed themselves at a narrow section of the mountain road.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not long after, he saw Roman soldiers forming up at the foot of the mountain. While the auxiliary troops once again discarded their shields, spears, and armor, and picked up shovels and other digging tools, a sense of unease crept into Spartacus’ heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Not good, the Romans want to trap us on this mountain!” Hamilcar voiced his concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The gladiators beside them had their faces filled with alarm, all looking at Spartacus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With a stern face, Spartacus withdrew his gaze from below and said to everyone, “Let’s go back up the mountain, there’s no need to defend this place.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “What if the Romans attack us up here?” a worried gladiator asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I actually hope they continue to advance,” Spartacus replied with a remark before turning around and heading up the mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar understood his meaning, while the other gladiators were somewhat puzzled, but they also followed suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mountain road wound its way upward, and as Spartacus walked, he suddenly stopped. He saw a row of wagons parked near up ahead, with no horses hitched to them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus approached and examined each one closely. Inside the wagons, there were either bags of flour or smoked meat, along with some sealed wine jars and plenty of dry bread…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus felt slightly relieved and muttered to Hamilcar, “Maximus is quite well-prepared. But why leave everything here? In case the Romans attack us up here, won’t it all fall into their hands?”\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 29": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 29 – Maximus’ Suggestion\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    “The road ahead is narrow, and the wagons cannot pass,” Hamilcar thought for a moment and explained. “Besides, the people in the logistics team are mostly elderly, women, and children. They won’t be able to protect these wagons. It’s already their utmost effort to bring them up the mountain.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “That’s true. Maximus was able to organize the logistics team and safely bring these provisions up the mountain despite our defeat in battle and being pursued by the Roman army. It was not an easy task. It’s indeed the right decision to let him take charge of the logistics team,” Spartacus praised Maximus, then turned to the other gladiators and said, “Vasilis, you stay here with our brothers and guard our food.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vasilis, a Thracian gladiator who had always trusted Spartacus, immediately obeyed the order.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While the other gladiators stayed behind, Spartacus and Hamilcar continued their ascent. After a while, they saw a group of over ten people coming down from above.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus recognized the leader as gladiator Phaselus at first glance. He had injured his leg while escaping from the gladiator school but recovered after twenty days of rest. He served as a leader of ten in Artorix’s team. When he saw Spartacus, his tired eyes suddenly lit up, and he respectfully called out, “Commander Spartacus!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Behind him were all newly recruited slave soldiers. Their heads were hanging low, with lifeless expressions, and they didn’t even bother to look up at Spartacus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus noticed this and asked, “Where are you all going?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Maximus requested someone to guard the food in the wagons below, but no one was willing. Only I——” Phaselus said somewhat helplessly, “Well, since I have a good relationship with Maximus, I couldn’t refuse.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     It seems that Maximus hasn’t considered everything…\n    </em>\n    Spartacus subconsciously glanced at Hamilcar, then said, “You don’t need to go down. I’ve already asked Vasilis and others to guard it.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Upon hearing this, Phaselus immediately became spirited and turned to the others, saying, “Brothers, we don’t need to go down. Let’s go up and rest.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The others turned around, relieved, but couldn’t be bothered to respond.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus furrowed his brow even tighter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At a bend in the mountain path, Phaselus shouted ahead, “Commander, the road ahead is steeper. Be careful. We were too panicked when we came up earlier and…some of our brothers fell…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the rebel army established their base in the small vineyard, Spartacus personally surveyed the surrounding terrain. He had also walked on this mountain and did not feel it was particularly difficult to traverse, but Phaselus’ words shocked him. He then felt a pain in his heart as he silently followed Phaselus and his group along the “steepest” section of the mountain path, arriving at the refuge for the routed rebel soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This was a plateau at the mountaintop, surrounded by rough and uneven rocks. In the center, there was a deposit of thick, dark brown soil. With ample sunlight, it was no wonder it was developed into a vineyard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the wooden sheds that were blocking the mountain wind had been torn down, and the grape trellises were nowhere to be seen. There were no lush green leaves or heavy clusters of grapes, only densely packed rebel soldiers. They sat crowded on the ground, some leaning on each other and falling asleep from exhaustion, others clutching their wounds and groaning incessantly, and some with a dejected expression, silently shedding tears… Each of them was dispirited and demoralized. When Spartacus entered this place, more than half of the people remained motionless like wooden sculptures, as if the leader of the rebel army did not exist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only the three leaders, Crixus, Oenomaus, and Artorix, who were sitting at the edge of the plateau, stood up. And from the dense crowd, Maximus, who was in the innermost part of the plateau, squeezed his way through.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “How many of us are left?” Spartacus first asked the question he was most concerned about.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Maximus did a rough count for me just now. There are about 1,400 people here, including 170 people from the logistics team,” even Crixus, who was usually full of fighting spirit, couldn’t help but feel dejected. “Among these people, more than 200 are injured, and it may be impossible for them to fight again in the short term…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus felt a sense of sorrow in his heart. Before the battle started, the rebel army had over 4,000 people, but after the battle, three-quarters of them were gone. Those who were not on the mountain either died in battle, were captured, or fled elsewhere…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus shook his head, temporarily pushing aside his grief, and asked with a serious expression, “How many gladiators have been injured or killed?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Including Vasilis and the others who stayed halfway up the mountain, there are still 163…” Crixus, the strong-willed Gaul, also showed a sense of sadness. “Boudoville, Nigel, Vibert… they died in the battle against the Romans… I saw it with my own eyes…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The names Crixus mentioned were all Gaulish gladiators and close friends of his.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus patted his shoulder firmly to offer comfort.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Spartacus, the Romans are building a camp at the foot of the mountain, attempting to trap us here. What should we do now?!” Artorix interjected anxiously. They could see the situation below from the plateau.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Let’s take advantage of the fact that the Romans haven’t finished digging their trenches yet. We should charge down together and launch a surprise attack on them. We can definitely break through their encirclement!” Oenomaus said loudly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We have some food, but we don’t have enough water. If we’re surrounded by the Romans for three or four days, we’ll all die of thirst. It’s better to do as Oenomaus suggests. After everyone have rested enough, we’ll go down the mountain and fight the Romans!” Crixus said through clenched teeth.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Artorix, although he didn’t speak, clearly expressed his agreement through his expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     It seems these three have reached a consensus in advance…\n    </em>\n    Spartacus hesitated for a moment. The Romans building a camp at the foot of the mountain were not without precautions, their regular troops were standing guard nearby. The previous charge of over 4,000 men had failed to break through the enemy line. Now, to lead these 1,000 plus demoralized soldiers to attack down the mountain, this was simply gambling with their lives! …However, if they didn’t do this, and let themselves be surrounded and trapped on the mountain by the Romans, would they just wait for death with their eyes wide open?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus was in a dilemma. Just as he was about to say, “Let me think again,” he suddenly heard Maximus who had rushed over: “The Romans can’t block us if we can quietly descend the mountain.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Quietly descend? How?” Crixus, upon hearing this, became furious. “This mountain is surrounded by cliffs on all sides except this one. There is no place to set foot. Dreaming is the only way you can quietly climb down this mountain! If it weren’t for you leading the logistics team up this mountain, causing the soldiers to follow, we wouldn’t be trapped on this mountain in the first place!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Crixus, if Maximus didn’t lead the panicked soldiers up the mountain, we might still be on the run right now. It would be impossible for us to be here discussing how to break through,” Hamilcar immediately defended Maximus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “At least that way, we would still have a chance to escape. We wouldn’t be waiting here to die like we are now!” Crixus retorted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Enough arguing!” Spartacus shouted impatiently, then looked at Maximus with a voice filled with anticipation and tension. He asked, “What do you mean by ‘quietly descending the mountain’? Is there another way down?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Of course, there is!” Maximus looked at everyone confidently, and finally, his gaze fell on Crixus. He said in a deep voice, “You were right just now. Except for this side, the mountain is surrounded by cliffs. The distance to the ground is too high, making it indeed difficult to descend. But it’s not impossible! I brought several sturdy ropes. Although they’re not long enough to reach the bottom when combined, there are plenty of grapevines here. Some of the old vines are very strong. By connecting them with the ropes, we can lower ourselves from here to the ground. Moreover——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus pointed to the eastern cliff and emphasized, “I examined the terrain over there. There are two ridges that reach the ground vertically. Some of the cliffs between the ridges can be used as footholds. We can slide down on the ropes while using the cliffs for support. We should be able to reach the bottom smoothly. And that side is separated by a mountain from the camp the Romans are building. It’s unlikely they would notice our actions.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus’s words made Spartacus skeptical, but the newfound hope revitalized him. He turned his head and said loudly to the other leaders, “Let’s go, let’s all go and take a look!”\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 30": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 30 – Commander-in-Chief\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    Under Maximus’ lead, the group squeezed through the crowd with a sense of anxiety. They carefully examined the eastern cliff, inspected the bundles of ropes Maximus had brought up the mountain in a wagon, and personally tested the grapevines the women of the logistics team were twisting to make ropes…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The worries on the faces of the rebel forces’ leaders finally disappeared, and their confidence was restored.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus gave Maximus a powerful hug. “Maximus, thank you! You saved us all!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar stepped forward and lightly punched Maximus in the chest. “Well done, boy!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Artorix smiled at him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Oenomaus scratched his head awkwardly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus coughed twice. “Maximus’ idea is indeed good, but we won’t know if it can really be executed until we try. Even if it is possible, not everyone has the courage and ability to climb down this mountain. Our injured brothers can’t do it, and neither can the people from the logistics team!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The leaders were taken aback and their expressions became serious once again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus couldn’t help but speak again, but Spartacus interrupted in a solemn tone, “Don’t worry about them. We can quietly descend the mountain using this method and launch a surprise attack on the Romans! The Romans must have studied the terrain beforehand, which is why they built their camp at the foot of the mountain, thinking they could trap us here. They will definitely lack precautions——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus’ eyes lit up, and he excitedly interjected, “Spartacus is right! Let’s do it this way! Let the brothers rest for a day, recover their strength, and then quietly climb down the mountain tomorrow night. The Romans will definitely be asleep by then, and we can launch a surprise attack. We will definitely defeat them!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Not tomorrow night, but tonight. We will launch the attack tonight!” Spartacus emphasized.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Tonight? Isn’t it too rushed?!” Hamilcar exclaimed in surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The Romans have just fought against us, but they haven’t rested. The auxiliaries are building the camp, the legionnaires are on guard, and the cavalry is patrolling around…” Spartacus pointed down the mountain and analyzed seriously, “Look! Their personnel are concentrated on that side. They probably intend to dig trenches, build earthen walls, and set traps under this slope before nightfall to completely block our descent. That means they won’t have enough time and manpower to fortify the other directions of their camp. Besides, they have been fighting all day and will surely be fast asleep at night, relaxing their patrols and vigilance. We can easily break into their camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “However, if we wait until tomorrow night… This Roman army only stayed at the olive farm for one night yesterday, but they still built a camp. It shows that their commander is very cautious. Tomorrow, he will certainly demand his soldiers to fortify the entire camp’s defenses. By then, it will be more difficult for us to launch a surprise attack…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone was convinced, but Artorix reminded, “Spartacus, what you said is undoubtedly correct, but after our defeat, most of our brothers have lost their desire to fight. They may not dare to follow us and climb down the mountain, risking great danger to ambush the Romans.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Leave that to me,” Spartacus responded without hesitation, then walked briskly to the center of the plateau.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Brothers, the reason we failed in the battle against the Romans this time is entirely my fault!” Spartacus began, shocking many soldiers who looked up in confusion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I had fear in my heart towards the Romans, so I always wanted to gain more advantages before the battle, thinking that only then could we ultimately win. Therefore, I waited for the Romans to attack first instead of leading you to initiate the attack. But I clearly forgot that the Romans possessed unimaginable wealth and exceptionally superior equipment. The more we waited, the more advantages the Romans could gather, and the less likely we could defeat them!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus’ voice was loud and earnest, attracting the attention of almost everyone on the plateau.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “So, compared to the Roman army, do we, the poor ones, have any strengths that surpass the Romans?!” Spartacus asked loudly before lowering his voice. “I used to live in a Thracian tribe near the Black Sea. I had a wife, children, and a peaceful and fulfilling life… But then the Romans came. They forcibly conscripted people from our tribe as auxiliaries, and I was forced to follow the Roman army to Asia Minor…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Little did I know that not long after, another Roman army arrived near my hometown. While forcibly collecting food from the various tribes of Thrace, two Roman soldiers attempted to violate… the women of our tribe. In their anger, my fellow tribesmen killed them, which angered the Romans. They killed all the tribesmen in our tribe and burned down the entire village as a warning to other Thracian tribes. My wife and children died as a result…” Spartacus’s voice trembled, and his eyes were filled with tears.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone listened attentively, their expressions solemn.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Although our fellow Thracians from other Thracian tribes rushed into Asia Minor and secretly told us this shocking news while we were still fighting for the Romans, we failed to escape the Romans’ pursuit and eventually became their slaves. We were forced to fight in the arena to entertain those despicable Romans…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Brothers, just like me, all of you have once enjoyed a life of freedom but became slaves of the Romans for various reasons. Day and night, we endured their whippings and toiled for them tirelessly, like cattle and sheep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The reason you joined our ranks is because you refuse to be slaves any longer. You want your freedom back. For this, you are not afraid to face the mighty Roman army. Because you’ve suffered hell already, death does not scare you anymore!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus’ voice grew louder, “The Romans are indeed powerful, but the more wealth they possess, the more they fear death. That is where we surpass them, for only those who fearlessly face death are true warriors who can create great miracles!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “In the previous battle, we failed, but it also made the Romans underestimate us even more. They have set up their camp at the foot of the mountain, thinking that we will obediently stay on the mountain and starve like docile cattle and sheep. But they will never expect that tonight, we will descend from the cliffs like agile apes and launch a surprise attack on the unprepared Roman camp like ferocious mountain eagles, utterly defeating them! Brothers, are you willing to join me in this assault?!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldiers were filled with renewed spirit, but some remained puzzled. One person asked loudly, “Commander Spartacus, this mountain has Romans guarding it on one side, and the rest are impassable cliffs. How can we possibly climb down?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Archidas, I remember you. You were a slave herding cattle for the Romans in a nearby farm. You are familiar with the terrain here. Indeed, what you said is true. There are no other paths down the mountain except for this side. But…” Spartacus took a deep breath, passionately proclaiming, “As long as we do not fear death, we can create miracles! I will be the first to climb down, and if you see me safely reach the ground, will you follow me?!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus surveyed the crowd, raising his voice, “Will you follow me?! With the hatred in your hearts, will you follow me in attacking the Roman camp and striking down those high and mighty Romans?! Will you follow me and show them that we are not lowly cattle and sheep but heroes who can create miracles, and are gods of death who can make them kneel down in fear and beg for mercy?! Will you follow me to regain our freedom?!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “FOR FREEDOM! FOR OUR FREEDOM!!!” The soldiers were finally fired up, shouting eagerly. The previously silent and gloomy atmosphere was swept away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     Amazing!\n    </em>\n    Maximus watched Spartacus standing in the center of the crowd and couldn’t help but be amazed. He understood why Spartacus had always been the commander of the uprising in history, with his soldiers swearing unwavering loyalty.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     A leader with such inspiring charisma is worth learning from\n    </em>\n    , Maximus thought to himself.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 31": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 31 – Night Raid\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    As the dark night arrived and the full moon hung in the sky, everything fell silent. The soldiers of the uprising, who had been resting on the ground since the afternoon, awakened from their sleep. After eating the carefully prepared food by the logistics team, they were full of energy and high morale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, when they arrived at the eastern cliff under Spartacus’ lead and looked down, their hearts began to tremble. The steep cliff resembled a sharp blade, with an unfathomable depth below. The strong mountain wind howled, rustling the trees below like demons dancing, ready to devour human flesh at any moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mountain wind pressed against the cliff and blew against the bodies of the rebel soldiers at the edge, making it almost impossible for them to stand firm…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just as they felt fearful, Spartacus’ deep voice rang in their ears, “I’ll go first.” Without hesitation, he fulfilled his promise. His strong hands gripped a thick rope tied securely to a large rock. His sturdy legs stepped on the rocky crevices between the mountain ridges, slowly descending along the hanging rope…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone on the cliff held their breath, nervously watching his diminishing figure. Every swing of the rope and every groan he made tightened their nerves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the moonlight was bright tonight, the darkness below the cliff eventually engulfed Spartacus’ figure. They couldn’t see him anymore, which made them even more nervous. It wasn’t until the rope shook forcefully three times, followed by three more shakes, signaling the agreed-upon signal…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldiers breathed a sigh of relief, their faces showing joy. Spartacus succeeded! He safely reached the ground!!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “It’s my turn.” Crixus stepped forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “And me too.” Oenomaus also stepped forward. This was because two ropes were hanging down from the plateau to ensure that the soldiers could descend the mountain as quickly as possible. Otherwise, with Spartacus’ slow pace, it would take a long time for all five hundred warriors to reach the foot of the mountain one by one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus, Oenomaus, and other gladiators successfully descended the mountain, greatly inspiring the remaining warriors on the mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, things were not without difficulties. Occasionally, a warrior would accidentally bump into a mountain ridge or fall off while descending. Their screams were drowned out by the howling mountain wind…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But these accidents were not enough to instill fear in the warriors. On the contrary, they were eager to descend the mountain and follow Spartacus to strike a blow against the Romans.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The reason they chose only five hundred warriors to launch a surprise attack on the Roman camp was that the rebel army currently had only around 500 short swords and spears. The ones with courage and combat capability were also around 500. Apart from the gladiators, most of them were Celtic people from the Iberian Peninsula, who had been enslaved for a short time and retained their wild nature.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It’s unclear how much time had passed, but the warriors had all climbed down the mountain. Those who remained on the mountain continued to gaze down at the cliff’s edge. They were reluctant to leave, even though it was pitch black and they couldn’t see any trace of the approaching army about to head to the battlefield. However, that was their only hope of survival!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “It’s time to go! We should also do our part!” Hamilcar reminded everyone, leading the way down the mountain path. The other soldiers followed him one by one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following closely behind was Maximus. Unlike the others, he was not anxious or uneasy. Memories from his past life convinced him that Spartacus leading a surprise attack on the Roman camp would succeed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Agnes, Cornelius, and Vorenus, take care of the others and don’t let them wander off!” Maximus reminded his subordinates loudly, to avoid making the same mistakes as before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Be careful, Teacher Maximus!” The children said their farewells reluctantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Don’t worry, tomorrow you can come down the mountain and continue your studies in the farm!” Maximus waved confidently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Behind him were the members of the wagon team led by Pigres, each leading a packhorse. There were a total of ten horses, blindfolded and obediently following their handlers. When they had initially driven the wagons up the mountain, the handlers couldn’t bear to leave the horses behind on the mountainside due to the narrow road. As a result, they brought the horses to the plateau, which drew complaints from some soldiers as they took up a lot of space. But now, they might play an important role in the upcoming operation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Behind the wagon team were over 500 rebel soldiers, marching in a long line, carefully treading the rough and uneven mountain path. Without torches, they could only rely on the moonlight to see the way ahead. Therefore, no one was distracted or joking around, focusing all their attention on their footsteps.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The mountain path gradually widened. When they were about to reach a curved path, Hamilcar and Maximus, who were leading, stopped and crouched down, peering down below. Ahead was a wide gentle slope, and a few dozen meters further down was the foot of the mountain. There, a long trench and earth wall could be seen, with a few watchtowers in front of the trench. Several torches were mounted on the earth wall, illuminating that area. Shadows of people could be seen moving behind the earth wall… It seemed that the Romans had a tight defense on the mountain path, so they had no choice but to wait.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Waiting was an excruciating ordeal, especially when they didn’t know if the other team could successfully raid the enemy’s camp. Even Hamilcar eventually became restless and impatient, let alone the others. Only Maximus remained calm and composed, occasionally comforting others in a low voice, “Don’t worry, Spartacus and the others must have already safely reached the flank of the Roman camp. They just need some time to assess the camp’s situation and plan the attack, aiming to bring down the entire camp in one fell swoop…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The younger generation is really formidable, huh!” Hamilcar sighed in his heart, just as he was about to praise his apprentice. Suddenly, he faintly heard the sounds of fighting coming from below the mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He quickly turned his ear to listen, and the sounds grew louder and louder… Due to the obstruction of the vineyard buildings, Hamilcar and his group couldn’t see the situation of the Roman camp, but they were certain that Spartacus and his group were already attacking the Roman camp. As a result, everyone’s faces lit up with excitement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soon, they could clearly see the Roman soldiers on guard behind the earth wall retreating.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Brothers, it’s our turn!” Hamilcar turned around and said.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Commander Hamilcar, please give the order. We can’t wait any longer!” Everyone urged eagerly in hushed voices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar instructed Pigres and the others from the wagon team to lead the horses out of the mountain path and line up on the gentle slope.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Taking off their blindfolds and bridles, the handlers hesitated but ultimately drew their short daggers and ruthlessly stabbed the horses’ hindquarters a few times.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The horses let out pained neighs and fled forward in terror. They crashed through the palisade, some falling into the trench, and others colliding with the earth wall. The force of their charge was so great that it directly toppled the two-meter-high earth wall.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “It worked!” Maximus couldn’t help but raise his fist in triumph, after all, it was his idea to use the horses to clear the way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Brothers, follow me and kill the Romans!” Hamilcar shouted loudly, leading the charge downhill.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “KILL THOSE DAMN ROMANS! KILL THEM!” Everyone shouted with extreme excitement. Although most of them were unarmed and poorly dressed (many new recruits had discarded their weapons during the daytime escape), their fighting spirit was high. They followed the path trampled by the horses, crossed the trenches, and rushed through the breaches in the earth wall. The firelight from the vineyard in front illuminated their way, and they could clearly see the fierce battle taking place in front of the farm’s entrance. They roared in anger and charged forward.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the influence of such high morale, Maximus’ blood boiled, and he had forgotten about his fear. Charging ahead, the meat cleaver in his right hand struck a Roman soldier’s head, who let out a scream. In the next moment, Maximus’ left hand, wielding another cleaver, swiftly swung towards the neck of another enemy beside him…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus’ body, which had undergone years of hellish training as a gladiator, displayed astonishing lethality at this moment. Maximus wielded dual blades, charging through the enemy forces, as if nothing could stand in his way.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In reality, the majority of the enemies were still waking up from their sleep, unable to don their armor or pick up their weapons in time. They began to flee, attempting to seek refuge inside the farm, only to be intercepted by a group of rebel soldiers.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 32": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 32 – Victory and Sorrow\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     Content Warning:\n    </strong>\n    This chapter contains graphic violence and mature themes.

However, just as the Romans were about to recover the routing troops, to their surprise, Hamilcar and a few hundred men arrived just in time. Although they lacked weapons, these rebel soldiers, mostly former slaves with frail bodies, carried a deep hatred for the Romans. They used their bodies to collide, their fists to strike, and even their teeth to bite, exhibiting a ferocious and frenzied appearance.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Roman soldiers completely collapsed amidst the screams.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Charge in! Follow me into the farm!” Hamilcar shouted, brandishing his sword high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It was too late for the Roman soldiers inside the farm to close the gates. First, the routing troops rushed in, and the defenders hesitated to stab out with their swords at their comrades. In an instant, the thin defensive line was thrown into disarray by the fleeing soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rebel soldiers then poured in and launched a frenzied attack on the disorganized Roman soldiers in the courtyard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If these Roman recruits had fought in formation, they might have been able to withstand the rebel soldiers’ assault due to their excellent equipment. However, they were surrounded by chaos, and the rebel soldiers’ furious roars sounded like a death knell to them. Already terrified, they completely lost their fighting spirit and knelt down, surrendering one after another.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glaber, standing on the balcony of the main building, immediately shifted his gaze. Outside the farm was the Roman camp engulfed in flames. Those damn slaves, like wild beasts, were crazily hunting down the scattered fleeing Roman soldiers, their screams echoing throughout the camp…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Glaber closed his eyes in anguish, then let out a long sigh. He straightened his military attire, picked up his short sword, and turned to descend the stairs. “I am a Roman magistrate, the commander of this army, Gaius Claudius Glaber. I am willing to surrender with my troops and hope that——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he could finish his words, someone rushed forward and delivered a powerful punch, knocking him to the ground. “F*ck off! You’ve all become prisoners, yet you still have so much nonsense to say!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus recognized this brutal guy; it was none other than Torquevado.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ……………………………………………………\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus led his troops quietly to the Roman army camp. As he had anticipated, there were no defenses around the camp, and even the guards were deep in slumber. Instead of launching an immediate assault, Spartacus took the time to assess the situation of the entire camp. He then instructed Crixus, Oenomaus, and Artorix to lead their respective troops in a surprise attack from three different directions. They set the tents on fire, and slaughtered the sleeping Roman soldiers, while Spartacus and his small group infiltrated the center of the camp. When the chaos ensued and the camp fell into disarray, they made a direct assault on the commander’s tent, killing the guards on their way. Spartacus then beheaded Vettinius, the camp commander. With no leadership left in the camp, the resistance was completely shattered.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rebel soldiers successfully raided the Roman camp, completely defeating the Roman army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the matter was not over yet. Spartacus learned from the captives that there were still 200 auxiliary soldiers stationed at an olive farm one and a half kilometers away from the camp, and some supplies were stored there as well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Ignoring fatigue, Spartacus immediately led 300 men to attack.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Campanian auxiliaries stationed there had already noticed the flames and heard the sounds of battle coming from the vineyard farm. They were unsure of what was happening but were too fearful to send anyone to investigate in the darkness. They were also afraid of Roman punishment, and dared not escape on their own. It wasn’t until some fleeing soldiers arrived and informed them of the news of the enemy’s surprise attack and the disastrous defeat of the Roman army that they hurriedly gathered their belongings to prepare to leave. However, Spartacus and his army intercepted them just in time…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As Spartacus led the prisoners and the wagons filled with supplies back to the vineyard farm, the eastern sky was already showing a pale light.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Laughter and cheers filled the hillside as the exhausted rebel soldiers, who had been fighting all night, continued their tireless work. Some soldiers were boasting about their achievements from the previous night’s battle, others were donning armor stripped from the bodies of Roman soldiers, some were organizing the tents in the camp, and others were testing the captured warhorses…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When they saw Spartacus returning with his army, they waved their arms and cheered:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Spartacus! Spartacus!! Spartacus!!!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Other rebel leaders heard the news and came out of the farm to greet them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Spartacus, it seems like you’ve had a fruitful journey!” Hamilcar looked at the troops behind Spartacus and said with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “It has been fruitful indeed!” Spartacus beamed. “We captured over 100 Campanian auxiliaries, seized a good amount of food, and obtained a batch of weapons and equipment, all loaded in the wagons. Additionally, we also captured a group of slaves from the Roman army.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “That’s excellent news! Now we don’t have to worry about a shortage of weapons for a while!” Crixus exclaimed with joy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “How are things over here? What about our casualties?” Spartacus asked with concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hammilcar replied, “We lost 86 men in battle, and 42 were wounded, but all of them have minor wounds. We killed and wounded over 1,200 enemies (in fact, more than half of them were trampled and killed in the chaos and panic of the night). We captured nearly a thousand prisoners, including their legatus, Glaber… We haven’t had a chance to tally the captured weapons and armor yet. Last night, the Romans were caught off guard while they were sleeping, and most of them left their weapons and armor in their tents. We should have made a significant gain, however, many of our brothers have already put on Roman armor…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Let them wear it if they want. After all, it was meant for them. If we had enough weapons and armor from the beginning, we wouldn’t have had so many casualties,” Spartacus lamented, and the others fell silent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus quickly changed the subject, “Maximus, is breakfast ready? We’re all hungry.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Our logistics team just came down from the hill and they’re busy in the kitchen. Breakfast may take a while,” Maximus truthfully replied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus jokingly rubbed his stomach, “Oh, we’re all hungry…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Spartacus! Crixus! Oenomaus Artorix! Hamilcar!” A rider galloped towards them, shouting non-stop, “Something terrible happened!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Omarkel, calm down. What happened?” Spartacus asked calmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Just now, I was riding with a few comrades on the captured warhorses, chasing after the fleeing enemy to the west… and not far from there…” Omarkel pointed behind him, his expression filled with grief and anger, “We found so many bodies! The Roman prisoners we captured told me that yesterday evening, under the order of their legion commander, they killed all… our brothers… that were captured there. There were over 900 of them! Over 900!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus and the others’ faces instantly turned pale.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ………………………………………………\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This was a large elliptical pond, surrounded by stone embankments made of Roman cement. It was used as water storage and irrigation for the large farm. However, the pool was now filled with bodies, strewn haphazardly: Their eyes were vacant, their faces were contorted, with multiple sword wounds on their chests, and dark red scabs covering their bodies. It was evident that they had endured painful struggles before their deaths…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus stood in silence by the edge of the pond, and one of the nearby bodies caught his attention: she had gray hair, a frail body, and a wrinkled face…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus recognized her because she was a member of the logistics team named Saria. When she was assigned to his team initially, Maximus had noticed her weak physique and out of sympathy, he had suggested to Hamilcar to assign her light tasks in the kitchen. Saria had always been grateful, and every time she saw Maximus, she would warmly greet him and sometimes offer him a cup of goat’s milk to quench his thirst. Normally, goat’s milk had a strong odor, but the goat’s milk she prepared was not only light in smell but also had a slightly sweet and sour taste. Maximus hadn’t expected this elderly woman to have such a skill. After becoming the leader of the logistics team, he had planned to have Saria exclusively responsible for preparing goat’s milk in a few days…\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 33": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 33 – Post-War Discussions\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    Even though Maximus had only been in this world for a month, he hadn’t fully integrated himself into it. He still had an observer’s mentality in his daily activities. Seeing the kind and amiable old woman turn into a cold corpse in the blink of an eye made him feel extremely uncomfortable. He also felt a sense of self-blame because he didn’t gather the scattered members of the logistics team who were fighting the fire at the camp yesterday and led them to the plateau as soon as possible. The chaotic retreat resulted in the loss of over 30 members of the logistics team, and now Saria’s lifeless body lay here. Maximus feared that others might also be among the corpses in this pond.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The thought made Maximus’ breathing quicken, and he became hesitant to look further, afraid of seeing more familiar corpses.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beside Maximus, Crixus suddenly roared, startling him. The Gaul warrior gritted his teeth and said through clenched jaws, “The Romans massacred our captured brothers. This blood must be repaid with blood!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus and the other leaders did not oppose him. They were equally consumed by anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “After breakfast, gather our brothers and offer a blood sacrifice with those Roman captives!” Spartacus made a cold decision.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …………………………………………………………\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “KILL HIM!!! KILL HIM!!! KILL HIM!!!” The rebel soldiers who had witnessed the mass grave of their comrades shouted in anger when they saw Glaber being brought into the center of the camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this scene, Glaber knew he wouldn’t be able to escape his fate today. He raised his head proudly, glancing at the crowd with a scornful gaze and a cold smile. “Ignorant slaves, even though you’re acting rampant today, tomorrow the mighty Roman army will break through your camp, hang you on crosses until your filthy blood runs dry——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before he could finish his cursed words, he felt immense pain in his body as the sharp tip of a sword emerged from his chest…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus repeatedly stabbed his chest from behind several times, completely shattering his heart, and only when Glaber stopped struggling did he decapitate him with a single strike, raising his head high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldiers cheered louder.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Next were the Roman officers, followed by the ordinary soldiers. They were executed by the rebel execution squad one by one, totaling more than 400 people. This wasn’t the total number of captives; the others were either Campanian auxiliary soldiers or slaves from the Roman legion, so they were spared.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus suggested to quickly cremate all the bodies in the camp and the farm to prevent the outbreak of a plague.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Even though Maximus explained, Spartacus, Crixus, and other leaders still didn’t understand why “too many corpses would lead to a plague.” However, just the word “plague” was enough to make them nervous. Moreover, the weather was hot, and the piles of bodies would easily emit a foul smell and breed mosquitoes, making everyone uneasy. Therefore, no one opposed Maximus’ suggestion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The entire rebel army sprang into action, collecting firewood and burning the corpses, creating roaring flames and billowing smoke throughout the camp. They were busy the entire day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During this process, soldiers who had scattered and fled during yesterday’s battle gradually returned to the camp. After escaping the pursuit of the Roman army, they hadn’t gone far and had been hiding in the nearby mountains. When they heard the tumultuous sounds of battle coming from the vineyard farm last night, they sensed something was happening. Therefore, they sent people to secretly investigate and were pleasantly surprised to find the Roman camp was filled with rebel soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By midnight, over 400 formerly missing rebel soldiers had returned, including 15 gladiators who were believed to have died in battle. The entire rebel army rejoiced in their victory.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this atmosphere of triumph, the leaders of the rebellion held Military Commanders Assembly in the guest room of the vineyard farm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Now that we have defeated a Roman legion and seized a large number of weapons and equipment, our strength has been greatly enhanced. But the Romans will not give up. They will undoubtedly send a stronger army to wipe us out. Therefore, we must quickly grow our forces before the next Roman legion arrives!” Spartacus warned everyone at the beginning of the meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Spartacus, you don’t need to worry. Previously, we were only engaged in minor skirmishes, but in less than a month, we expanded our original force of over 200 people to more than 4,000. Now that we have defeated the Roman army and demonstrated our power, more slaves will join us, and we have enough weapons to equip them. When the Roman army comes again, we have the capability to defeat them head-on!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When Crixus said these words, he felt ashamed inside. Previously, when fighting against the Roman legion, he had also felt fear deep down. That’s why, when facing the Roman battle formations, he couldn’t withstand the pressure and charged alongside Oenomaus on the left flank. But the last night’s surprise attack had bolstered his confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I agree with Crixus. Our forces will soon become vast, and new recruits won’t be wielding hoes and clubs anymore; they will have real swords and spears. However, we need to strengthen their training. Otherwise, even if they have weapons, they will still be scared and run away when facing the Roman attacks!” Oenomaus said loudly, recalling the yesterday’s battle. He had fought bravely at the forefront, yet the new recruits behind him were the first to flee. This impression was truly too deep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “It seems that everyone is aware that no matter how many people we have, if they lack training, they will only run away on the battlefield,” Spartacus looked at Hamilcar and said seriously, “Regarding the training of soldiers, Hamilcar, you not only need to start implementing it more intensively but also impose stricter discipline on our brothers. We will fully cooperate so that we can be confident of victory when we encounter the Roman legion again in the future.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I will do my best to help the new recruits improve their combat abilities!” Hamilcar made a commitment and continued, “I also have a proposal. Currently, we have nearly 500 Campanian prisoners, most of whom are from Naples. Instead of releasing them like we did at the Temple of Flora last time, we should escort them to the outskirts of Naples and negotiate with the people inside the city. We can exchange these prisoners for slaves and gladiators.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “And there’s another benefit to doing this. I heard that Naples is a city of trade with many merchants. They will spread the news of our victory faster and wider, attracting more slaves to join our ranks.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “That’s a great idea!” Spartacus exclaimed, slapping his thigh.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I also think it’s a good plan. We shouldn’t just let these Campanian prisoners go for nothing. However, we don’t know much about the slaves and gladiators inside Naples. What if the Neapolitans include some people loyal to them in the exchange and then instruct them to cause trouble in our ranks?” Artorix expressed his concern.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I hate traitors the most, and it’s troublesome to deal with them!” Crixus chimed in, glancing intentionally or unintentionally at Maximus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus pondered for a moment and said, “We won’t lack warriors, and those who willingly join us are the most reliable. There’s no need to ask Naples for people. What we lack most now is weapons. How about we let the Neapolitans exchange these prisoners for weapons instead?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one opposed this idea this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus looked at everyone and continued, “We are not familiar with the gladiators in Naples, but we are familiar with the gladiators in Capua. There are many gladiator schools there, mostly outside the city, and we have fought against them in the arena. After our strength has recovered in a few days, let’s send a team to launch a surprise attack on the outskirts of Capua, rescue the gladiators there, and have them join us to strengthen our forces!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I agree! Send me there when the time comes. The gladiator school there is full of Germanic warriors, and I’ve been wanting to rescue them!” Oenomaus said excitedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others also agreed because training new recruits was a long-term process, while the addition of gladiators meant immediate combat strength. Moreover, they shared a common background.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “There’s one more thing I’d like to discuss with you,” Spartacus said cautiously. “I want to abandon our current camp and lead the army to establish a new camp at a farm not far to the north.”\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 34": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 34 – Maximus’ Request\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    “Why?” Artorix was puzzled. “This place is so good. It’s easy for us to defend, and when we can’t hold on anymore, we can retreat to the plateau behind. It was this unique terrain that helped us defeat the Romans! This place is blessed by the war god Ares! Why should we give it up? Besides, if we move to the farm in the north, the terrain there is flat and vulnerable to sudden attacks from the Roman army. Once we’re defeated, it won’t be easy to retreat. Our legs can’t outrun the Roman cavalry.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus immediately spoke out loudly, “I agree with Spartacus’ suggestion. We shouldn’t stay on this mountain anymore! Yesterday’s battle has already shown us that relying solely on defense and waiting won’t win against the Romans. And the method we used to defeat the Romans this time cannot be repeated. The Romans will learn about the entire battle from the mouths of the fleeing soldiers, and the next time they attack us, they won’t make the same mistakes again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Defense requires skill, which the new recruits cannot learn in a short time. On the other hand, courage is crucial for an attack, and our brothers do not lack hatred for the Romans. Hatred will fill them with strength, so taking the initiative to attack is our best choice. Establishing a camp on flat ground leaves us vulnerable without natural defenses. We can only ensure our safety by defeating the enemy, while on this mountain, our fighting spirit can easily be weakened!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I also agree with Spartacus’ plan.” Hamilcar nodded towards Artorix, speaking in a gentle tone. “Aside from other factors, the farm in the north is surrounded by Roman ditches and earthworks, which actually provide better defense than our camp here. Moreover, training our soldiers on flat ground would be more advantageous. Once our forces expand, it will be easier for us to expand the camp outward. Additionally, on flat ground, the logistics team can transport supplies more easily…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Let’s move the camp quickly. There’s nothing good about staying here!” Oenomaus complained. “The camp surrounds us with a burnt smell, and there’s that pool of bodies. Even though they’ve been cremated, it’s still unpleasant to think about. We better find a new place quickly.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The suggestion to move the camp was approved, and it was decided to take action the next day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After making this decision, the leaders had little else to say. As usual, Spartacus asked the final question, “Does anyone have any other suggestions?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I do.” Maximus, who had been quiet in the corner, spoke up. “From yesterday to today, over 240 of our people have been injured to varying degrees. Based on the recovery of previous wounded soldiers, I’m afraid that more than half of them will die due to infected wounds and high fever. When I was young, I learned some medical skills. I believe that as long as we regularly change the bandages on their wounds, keep the wounds clean, provide them with sufficient rest, and give them enough good food… as long as it’s not a severely critical injury, the majority of them will eventually recover.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “But we haven’t taken care of them enough!” Maximus said with great sorrow. “Many of our brothers who fought alongside us before (referring to the gladiators injured during the escape from the school) died due to lack of proper treatment. We can’t continue like this! I suggest that we entrust all these wounded soldiers to our logistics team. I will personally ensure that they are well taken care of and do everything in my power to help them recover and return to duty.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “You know medicine, why didn’t you say so earlier?!” Crixus glared at him, complaining loudly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus immediately retorted, “I have some knowledge of medicine, but I have never actually treated anyone before. Taking care of wounded soldiers is a troublesome task. If it weren’t for the fact that I noticed too many of our wounded soldiers dying recently and that I just became the captain of the logistics team, giving me the opportunity to do something about it, I wouldn’t have bothered to intervene.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “You——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Alright, alright, treating wounded soldiers is indeed a troublesome task. We all experienced it back at the gladiator school. Maximus is willing to let the logistics team take care of the wounded, which is a great thing for us. We should all express our gratitude to him! Right?” Spartacus immediately affirmed Maximus’ suggestion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Maximus, I truly thank you. You’ve helped me tremendously this time!” Artorix sincerely expressed his gratitude. It was worth noting that the current rule in the rebel army was that if a soldier in a particular team was injured, it was the obligation of their own team to take care of their own. In Artorix’s team, there was a Thracian gladiator who had a chest injury that turned into an abscess. He had recurrent high fevers and would often howl uncontrollably, tormenting the entire team mentally. In the end, they strongly demanded to end his suffering.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    That wounded soldier happened to be Artorix’s fellow countryman, and they had a close relationship. In the end, Artorix had to make the difficult decision to end his life. So, without hesitation, he loudly said, “I raise both hands in agreement. Let the logistics team take care of the wounded!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus and Oenomaus had similar experiences, and they also expressed their agreement without delay.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, Hamilcar spoke up, “I remember when we were at the school, there was a doctor named Valerius who had excellent medical skills. He was able to treat many injured brothers and heal them. Perhaps this is due to his extensive experience in treating wounded gladiators. This time, when we go to Capua, it would be best to invite a doctor from the gladiator school and let him join to the logistics team to treat the wounded.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus’ eyes lit up, “That’s a good idea! However, these doctors receive decent compensation, and I’m afraid they won’t join us willingly.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “They have to join even if they don’t want to!” Crixus said coldly, and surprisingly, no one opposed, including Spartacus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     I thought you all upheld the principle of voluntary participation for everyone as you were with those farm slaves. It turns out, that when it comes to truly needed talents, you don’t hesitate to use any means!\n    </em>\n    Maximus glanced at the four of them and felt like he had learned a new trick.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I also agree with the idea of the logistics team taking care of the wounded. However, the logistics team is responsible for providing food, transporting supplies, and managing warehouses, so manpower is already stretched thin. Now you have to take care of the wounded as well. Do you have enough people?” Hamilcar raised his question with a serious expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus inwardly rejoiced, thinking, “Teacher is giving me a timely help!” He immediately spoke up, “Indeed, we are a bit short on manpower! There are currently over 240 wounded soldiers, and we need at least thirty to forty people to take care of them around the clock. And as you all should know, most of the logistics team members are physically weak. They can’t even carry the injured, so how can they take care of them properly? So, we not only need people, but we need strong and robust men!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus looked troubled and said, “But the major teams are also short on manpower… How about this, once we have new recruits, we’ll try to allocate more to the logistics team.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus, with a hint of complaint, suggested, “That’s all well and good, but it should have been done a long time ago. However, right now, we can’t delay any longer. The wounded soldiers urgently need care. I suggest we allocate the batch of slaves captured from the prisoners to our logistics team.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “That won’t work! These slaves are different from the new recruits who only know how to farm. They have already undergone military training and have some combat experience. It would be a waste to assign them to the logistics team!” Crixus immediately expressed his opposition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The batch of slaves they mentioned came from the recently defeated Roman army. According to the current Roman military system, the smallest unit of a Roman legion was a contubernium, consisting of ten individuals, two of whom were slaves. They did not participate in combat but were responsible for miscellaneous tasks such as carrying items for the other eight soldiers, cooking, setting up tents, repairing weapons, and taking care of the wounded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Roman army that came to Mount Vesuvius this time had a total of 560 such slaves. The rebel army launched a surprise attack on the Roman camp and captured over 200 of them. They are all publicly owned slaves of Rome, many of whom are war prisoners. After years of hard labor for Rome, they have the chance to be freed and become free citizens. Therefore, not all slaves were willing to join the rebellion, but the act of the rebel army slaughtering all Roman prisoners frightened them, so they all reluctantly expressed their agreement.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 35": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 35 – The Need for a Guard Unit\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    “It is precisely because these newly joined slaves are familiar with military affairs that they should not be treated as ordinary soldiers,” Maximus said confidently. “They can cook, which the kitchen of the logistics team needs; they can transport supplies, which the logistics team’s convoy requires; they can take care of the wounded, which the medical camp the logistics team is about to establish needs; and they can also maintain and repair weapons, which our troops urgently need…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “They also understand military training and how to construct a camp… We need them even more to teach our ignorant recruits!” Crixus reminded, unwilling to back down.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “It seems that this batch of new recruits is highly sought after,” Spartacus said seriously, looking at the two of them. “Each major team needs them to improve combat effectiveness, and the logistics team also needs them to provide better support for us. I suggest allocating thirty people to the logistics team for now, and when more people join, we can give the logistics team more personnel. What do you think?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    No one opposed this, but Maximus looked somewhat aggrieved. “Over 200 people, and we’re only getting 30 for the supply team. That’s too few! Well, for the sake of our entire team, I accept.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He paused for a moment and then continued with a serious expression, “I have another suggestion. I hope the logistics team can have its own guard unit!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In response, Crixus immediately objected, “Absolutely not! The logistics team is not responsible for combat, and your safety is protected by us. It is completely unnecessary to assign a guard unit to you.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We used to think the same way. With your protection, we didn’t have to worry about our safety,” Maximus said with a regretful tone. “But precisely because of that, when you were fighting at the foot of the mountain, our logistics team was busy extinguishing fires in the camp. The result: you lost the battle, discarded your weapons and armor, and fled for your lives, only thinking of saving yourselves. But did anyone think about stopping the pursuers for our logistics team?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “While we were in panic, we were still thinking of rushing the wagon up the mountain, so that when you defend the mountain in the future, you wouldn’t starve. As a result, we wasted time. Our logistics team consists of either elderly, women, or children. How could they possibly outrun you? In the end, over thirty people were caught up by enemy soldiers and died in that mass grave…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus sniffed, his expression filled with sorrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus was at a loss for words, unsure of how to refute.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus emphasized his words and continued, “We worked hard to bring the wagons up the mountain. Because the mountain road was narrow, we stopped halfway up, hoping that you would send troops to guard them and prevent them from being looted by the enemy. But what did you say? ‘No, our brothers just escaped from the pursuers, where do we have the energy to guard your wagons?’…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus sneered and said angrily, “Now that we have won the battle, everyone is celebrating our victory, but don’t forget that it was our logistics team who came up with the idea of descending from the cliff when you were in despair! It was our logistics team that worked hard to make the long rope that allowed you to descend safely! And it was our logistics team that made enough food for you to have the strength to fight the enemy! For the logistics team that played an important role in this war, I believe it is only right for it to have its own guard unit to protect itself!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus’ face turned pale, and Oenomaus and Artorix looked ashamed… The living room fell into silence for a moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus looked around at everyone and sincerely said, “The logistics team is indeed important to us, and it has made great contributions in the battle against the Romans. We must fight with all our might, and sometimes we truly have no spare energy to take care of the logistics team. That was my mistake! Now it seems that the logistics team does need a dedicated guard unit to ensure its safety. Let’s allocate 100 personnel to this guard unit for now, and when the logistics team expands, we can increase the number of personnel in the guard unit. What do you think?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I agree!” Maximus immediately responded loudly. Although he was a bit disappointed with the small number of personnel in the guard unit, having the logistics team armed would make certain things easier to handle.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After Maximus made his statement, Crixus, Oenomaus, and Artorix felt too embarrassed to object, and the matter was settled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I hope this guard unit of a hundred soldiers will be commanded by Phaselus,” Maximus looked at Spartacus and made a further request, as Phaselus currently served under Spartacus as the captain of the first squad.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus believed that Maximus made this request because he had a good relationship with Phaselus, and yesterday on the plateau, only Phaselus responded to Maximus’ request to help him guard the wagons. Therefore, appointing Phaselus as the leader of the guard unit should ensure that he would follow Maximus’ orders. Spartacus was pleased with this and readily agreed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the meeting ended, Maximus caught up with Hamilcar and whispered, “Teacher, thanks for your help earlier!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar turned to look at him and said with concern, “Now that the logistics team has added a guard unit and needs to take care of the wounded, there will be more tasks and more people to manage than before. Can you handle it alone? And be careful to not let any problems arise, giving other people an opportunity to use it against you.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus understood who Hamilcar was referring to and immediately reassured him, “Teacher, rest assured, I will do my best to manage the logistics team and provide better assistance to our entire team!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar nodded. “Let’s go. Come with me now to select those 30 new recruits.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    More than 200 Roman legion slaves had just joined the rebel army and had not yet been assigned to different teams. For the time being, they were under the jurisdiction of Hamilcar, who had recently taken charge of military affairs. The majority of them were young men in their 20s and 30s, with only a few middle-aged and elderly individuals over the age of 40. They were all in good health, with a healthy complexion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As public slaves of Rome, it was evident that they were treated fairly well within the Roman army. However, compared to other slaves who joined the rebel army, many of them seemed overly cautious. When Hamilcar gathered them together, most of them kept their heads down, appearing lethargic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Observing this, Maximus spoke loudly, “I am going to select 30 people from among you to join the logistics team. Those who join the logistics team will not have to fight the Romans directly and can enjoy good food. You’ll even get to spend time with women every day. Who among you is willing to go?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Upon hearing this, the slaves became spirited and eagerly shouted, “Me! Me! I am willing to go!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Though a few remained silent, they all raised their heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frowning, Maximus said, “We only need 30 people for the logistics team, and there are too many of you who want to join. So, I have to carefully choose among you… Who among you is skilled in carpentry? It would be best if you can construct siege weapons.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Me! Me!” Over 20 slaves simultaneously exclaimed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “So many of you?!” Maximus exclaimed in surprise, pointing to his right side and saying, “Then all of you come over here.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After these slaves stepped forward, Maximus stared at them with a fierce gaze and said, “Later, I will test your carpentry skills. If anyone is lying and I find out, the next time we fight the Romans, they will be placed at the forefront of the battle formation!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar hesitated because he noticed that many of the slaves who stepped forward looked uneasy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus took the opportunity to say, “Now, I will give you another chance to change your choice. If you feel that your carpentry skills are not sufficient, you can return your teams.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Immediately, more than half of the slaves lowered their heads and hurriedly stepped back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Among you, who knows the most about constructing camps? It would be even better if you know how to build roads.” Maximus continued, then looked at the slaves standing on his right side. “If any of you feel that you are proficient in this area, you can also step forward. The more you know, the more likely I will choose you.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Having learned from the previous lesson, this time over a dozen people spoke up, and some of those who had previously stepped back responded as well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Among you, who knows more about maintaining and repairing weapons and armor? It would be best if you are also skilled in using the Scorpio\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#gem-novels-note-1\" id=\"gem-novels-note-link-1\">\n      [1]\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    ….

He had to act quickly to prevent other leaders from realizing what he was doing and attempting to claim the slaves for themselves. Due to the limited number of spots, he chose slaves who had responded to multiple questions, resulting in most of the 30 individuals he selected being older in age.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar, observing the situation, felt something was amiss and asked softly, “These people you’ve chosen seem capable, but they are quite old. Can they properly care for so many wounded soldiers?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Confidently, Maximus replied, “Teacher, rest assured. Since I’ve promised, I will find a way to handle the treatment of wounded soldiers. However, in the future, you should allocate more young and strong individuals to our logistics team.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hesitating for a moment, Hamilcar said, “Alright, you can choose five more younger individuals to join the logistics team.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus reminded, “Teacher, thank you for your help, but if we do that, Crixus and the others might…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Interrupting, Hamilcar waved his hand dismissively, “Those you’ve taken are the elderly ones that no other unit wants. They are happy to be chosen, and you have suffered a loss because of it. Naturally, you should receive some compensation, and Crixus and the others shouldn’t have any objections to it.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing Hamilcar’s words, Maximus didn’t hold back any longer. He immediately selected five more slaves he deemed suitable, all in their 30s, and with the chosen 35 individuals, he left the camp and returned to the vineyard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First, he went directly to the kitchen, where he found Agnes busy inside.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Agnes saw him, she complained, “Captain, you informed me earlier that the leaders wanted the soldiers to celebrate the victory tonight and asked us to prepare a more elaborate dinner. You even wanted it ready before sunset. The time is tight, and we are short-staffed. Everyone is working hard, but I’m afraid it’s difficult to finish everything before dusk!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I understand your difficulties, so I’ve brought you some help,” Maximus said, leading Agnes out of the kitchen and pointing to the 35 individuals he had just brought back. He smiled and said, “They were once slaves in the Roman army, and now they are our new brothers in the logistics team. Since the kitchen is short-staffed, I’ve asked them to help. However, they are new here, so there might be some——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus pointed to his own chest and discreetly gave Agnes a signal.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After spending these days together, Agnes immediately understood Maximus’ intention. She looked at the newcomers, smiled, and exclaimed, “Oh, that’s wonderful! Finally, some decent-looking men have joined our logistics team! Welcome to join us! Let me tell you, being in our logistics team is much better than being in other teams. You will eat well, and sleep well, and there are plenty of young ladies around. As long as you work diligently, they will surely notice you! Come, come, come. Hurry and help them in the kitchen!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Agnes” words stirred the hearts of some of the younger slaves, and they immediately followed her into the kitchen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The others, however, did not move and instead looked at the oldest slave among them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After glancing at Maximus, the old slave calmly said to others, “Since we’re all here, let’s do whatever needs to be done. It’s better to be here than out there killing people.” With that, he walked straight into the kitchen, and the rest of the slaves followed closely behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus didn’t leave; he quietly stood at the doorway and observed the performance of the new slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Maximus!” A voice sounded next to him. He turned around and smiled, “Phaselus, welcome, welcome. I’ve been looking forward to your arrival!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I didn’t want to come, but Spartacus gave the order, saying you specifically requested me to be the captain of this guard unit for the logistics team,” Phaselus said, somewhat discontentedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus whispered, “Don’t worry, I didn’t bring you here just to be a babysitter for our logistics team. In the future, there will definitely be battles for the guard unit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Phaselus’ eyes lit up, and he quickly asked, “Are you saying——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We’ll talk about these matters later. At the very least, you should thank me now. I’ve promoted you from a decanus to a centurion, and as the captain of the guard, you no longer have to obey that… Anatos—”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “It’s Anatosian. When he heard that we are leaving because of you, he cursed and said he would make you regret it,” Phaselus chuckled with a hint of schadenfreude, then sighed, “Now I don’t have to listen to his orders anymore, but in the future, I’ll have to follow yours.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Don’t worry, I won’t be as domineering as Anatosian. We can discuss and decide things together in the future,” Maximus reassured him. After a few comforting words, he changed the subject and joked, “By the way, how many people did you bring?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Phaselus felt relieved by Maximus’ promise and answered seriously, “50 people. They were personally selected by Commander Spartacus from the First Team. They are all former slaves who joined the rebellion earlier, and none of them are gladiators. However, they all participated in the two battles yesterday, so they won’t fear the Romans like they used to. Commander Spartacus also wanted me to tell you that the First Team now has just over 600 soldiers, that he can’t spare any more people, and that the shortfall will be filled up later as soon as possible.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I understand,” Maximus said, but he felt surprised in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was aware of the current situation of the rebellion, but he didn’t expect Spartacus to send him so many people so quickly. The efficiency and generosity of his actions were truly admirable, making him think it was worth learning from.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Where are the members of our guard unit now?” Maximus looked around and asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “They are in the front courtyard.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus quickly met the members of the guard unit, and facing them, he changed his rhetoric, saying, “Brothers, welcome! Our logistics team has been hoping for a guard of our own! Are you willing to stay with our logistics team, alongside the elderly, children, and so many\n    <em>\n     women\n    </em>\n    , and protect them with all your might?!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “YES! PROTECT THEM!!” the soldiers of the guard unit shouted excitedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Very well, from today onwards, you are all part of the logistics team!” Maximus looked at them, his expression becoming serious. “The logistics team has its own rules, and you must strictly adhere to them. If you violate them, you will be punished! Those who execute orders diligently and perform exceptionally will receive my rewards, while those who show poor performance and refuse to follow orders will face my strict punishment! Do you all understand?!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “W-We understand,” the soldiers’ voices lowered considerably, and their gaze towards Maximus carried a hint of fear. They were different from the slaves in the Roman army and the gladiators. When they were defeated and felt hopeless on the mountain, they heard Maximus miraculous idea of “descending from the cliff” to the leaders. Later, most of them followed Hamilcar and Maximus to launch a surprise attack on the Roman camp, witnessing his remarkable prowess firsthand. Thus, they couldn’t help but hold a sense of awe when they saw him again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus noticed their expressions and continued, “Brothers, the young women are currently busy in the kitchen. Phaselus will take you there to help them.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldiers became excited once again. They were all born as slaves, and working was a common occurrence for them. Even if they didn’t know how to bake bread, they could still carry water, chop wood, slaughter sheep, skin animals, and so on.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The best way to familiarize and integrate the slaves of the Roman army and the soldiers of the guard unit into the logistics team as quickly as possible was to work together. That was why Maximus had stuffed them all into the kitchen.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the soldiers of the guard unit being led by Phaselus towards the kitchen, Maximus felt secretly excited. As the leader of the logistics team, he could attend the Military Commanders Assembly of the rebel army, but unlike Hamilcar, he only had the power to make suggestions and lacked voting rights. The gladiators only recognized Spartacus, Crixus, Artorix, Oenomaus, and Hamilcar as the leaders of the rebel army. This recognition originated from the five being the initial organizers of the uprising. However, this also showed that Maximus had little prestige among the military officers of the entire rebel army. Now, he finally had a 100-man unit under his command. Perhaps he could do more to elevate his position within the rebel army!\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 37": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 37 – Roman Veterans\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    The celebratory feast for the victory was successfully held at dusk. The setback faced by the rebels also had its advantages. The soldiers, numbering less than 2,000, were able to gather in a camp next to the farm. Dozens of people sat around a bonfire with a roasted lamb on top (after the Roman army defeated the rebels and entered the camp, they captured all the cattle and sheep that the logistics team had been herding, originally intended as food reserves, but unexpectedly, with the surprise attack of the rebel army that night, these livestock fell back into the hands of the logistics team.). Each person held a small jar of diluted wine in their hands, with freshly baked bread beneath them, and steaming chicken soup…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone drank wine, ate meat, lamented their miserable state during yesterday’s retreat, and boasted about their bravery during the surprise attack at night. Some people excitedly started singing, while others danced around the bonfire. Laughter and chatter filled the air, creating a lively and bustling atmosphere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus, Crixus, and a few other leaders walked around the camp, frequently clinking jars with the soldiers and sharing their joy. Wherever they went, there was always thunderous applause. The battle of the previous night had made the soldiers admire these leaders even more, and they hoped to achieve more victories under their command.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus and the logistics team were also invited, but Maximus declined, citing the presence of too many women in the logistics team and the fear that the soldiers’ revelry might lead to unexpected incidents and disrupt the festive atmosphere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus, considering the special circumstances of the logistics team, did not insist.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So, the logistics team held their own feast within the farm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Over 200 people were seated around ten bonfires in the courtyard. They also drank wine, ate meat, sang, and danced, but because there were both men and women present, it wasn’t as noisy as the camp. However, the joy in their hearts was even greater.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus also wandered around the bonfires, toasting with his subordinates.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    First, he toasted to Agnes, Pigres, and Cornelius, thanking them for their unwavering support in the past two days.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then, he proceeded to toast with the others from the logistics team, expressing gratitude for their hard work over the past month.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the ups and downs of the previous day, the members of the logistics team were extremely grateful and respectful towards Maximus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They appreciated Maximus for saving their lives. Unlike Maximus, who blamed himself, they believed that it was thanks to this young leader’s early preparations and arrangements that most of them, including the elderly, women, and children, managed to escape the pursuit of the Romans and avoided the same fate as other captured soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    They held great admiration for Maximus’ wisdom. While the soldiers cheered for Spartacus and the other leaders for leading them to victory, they believed that it was this young man who first found a way down the mountain and even had them prepare long ropes in advance. Maximus was truly the savior of the rebel army!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It is precisely because of this kind of conviction that several women boldly expressed to Maximus: “I am willing to sleep with you.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus was overwhelmed by the excessive enthusiasm of the veteran members of the logistics team, so he quickly ran over to the guard unit and toasted with the newly joined soldiers, hoping that they would become a strong support for the logistics team in the days to come.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Finally, he approached the Roman slave soldiers, who were mostly gathered around a bonfire on the edge of the courtyard.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “New members of the logistics team, come, let’s drink!” Maximus raised his wine jar high and shouted with a smile.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Drink!” Some people immediately responded, while others first turned to look at the slave who had taken the lead. When they saw him raising his wine jar, they followed suit.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus took a sip of the sweet and sour grape wine and said loudly, “Someone told me that this is Falernian wine, one of the best wines in Italy. The patrician elders of Rome often drink it. Do you think it tastes good?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The slaves were surprised and carefully took a sip. Then someone said, “It tastes good!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We don’t have cruel and vicious nobles here, no overseers who whip you with a lash. We are all suffering people, working happily together, and even eating good food that the Roman elites used to eat. Doesn’t it feel good?” Maximus asked with a smile, then looked towards the center of the courtyard. Someone was beating a simple rhythm on a drum, and several women were singing and dancing, attracting many men to joyfully dance around them, including the newly joined slaves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Compared to before, this place is like a paradise!” Someone excitedly replied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Yes, exactly!” Someone else happily agreed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “But how long can these happy days last?” Suddenly, someone in the crowd spoke up. It was the elderly that was acting as the leader of the Roman slave soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Fearlessly meeting Maximus’ gaze, he calmly said, “I’m sorry for saying something that might spoil the festive atmosphere, but I used to be a Roman citizen and a soldier in the Roman legion. I have served in the army for many years, and they,” the leader pointed to the other slaves around him, “were also Roman legion soldiers.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     No wonder these people understand construction, carpentry, weapon maintenance, and military training… They turned out to be veteran soldiers of the Roman legion. This is a real treasure!\n    </em>\n    Maximus felt delighted in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We used to be Roman citizens, but we now hate Rome!” the elderly leader emphasized, and those around him nodded in agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We were once soldiers under General Marius. We faithfully followed him because he protected the rights of us ordinary soldiers! But after his death, the dictator Sulla led his army to attack Rome, and the populares wanted to reorganize us retired soldiers to resist Sulla.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Many of my comrades recognized the precarious situation and refused to join. Only those of us without families to worry about thought that we absolutely could not let General Marius’s hard-won rights for us go to waste. So we responded to the call of the Senate and decided to risk it all in battle. But the result, tens of thousands of troops were defeated at the gates of Rome…” The leader spoke with a pained expression, and the people around him sighed, each wearing a look of regret.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We were captured by Sulla. He didn’t execute us like those Samnites, but he stripped us of our Roman citizenship and made us slaves, attempting to subject us to even more humiliation! These years, we have lived a life worse than death. Many of our brothers silently passed away, their bodies thrown into a pit outside the Porta Esquilina (Rome’s easternmost gate) where wild dogs gnawed on them… This time we are able to regain our freedom, we are truly grateful to you!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the leader should also thank the deceased Glaber. If not for his strong insistence on conscripting some old soldiers, both citizens and slaves, the recruiting officer wouldn’t have included these “Roman rebels” who had spent eight or nine years in slave camps. They were considered too old to be a threat, but they unexpectedly gained the opportunity for freedom.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Because we spent many years in the Roman legion, we know the strength of the Roman army. With just a small force of two or three thousand people like you, lacking weapons and equipment, even if you win one battle, once you attract Rome’s attention, you will likely face annihilation…” The elderly leader’s voice solemnly reminded them, his eyes filled with pain and sadness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The people around fell silent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus, however, remained unfazed. He looked intently at the old man, whose face showed some signs of age but still carried a robust physique. The long scar on his face added a touch of fierceness. Maximus asked, “May I know your name?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Cassius Frontinus.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     Just by hearing the name, one can tell that this person came from the Roman plebeians. No wonder he obeyed the call of the populares…\n    </em>\n    Maximus continued to inquire, “Frontinus, were you not just an ordinary soldier before?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I was a centurion in the legion for a while.” Frontinus hesitated for a moment, then answered. There was no hint of pride on his face, but rather a trace of melancholy.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 38": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 38 – The Sins of Rome\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     A centurion of a Roman legion who had been a soldier for many years!\n    </em>\n    Maximus’s eyes lit up, and a surge of excitement rose in his heart. He wiped the remnants of wine from his mouth with his hand and confidently said, “I can answer your concerns right now!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With that, he turned and walked towards the center of the courtyard, shouting, “Everyone, please calm down for a moment. I have something to say to all of you!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The courtyard gradually regained its quietness as the people who were singing and dancing stepped aside. Everyone’s gaze focused on Maximus standing in the center, which showed his current prestige in the logistics team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “My brothers and sisters!” Maximus scanned the surroundings and spoke loudly, “Someone just told me, ‘The Roman army is incredibly powerful. They have defeated many city-states and kingdoms in the Mediterranean. Our small and weak force composed of slaves, even if we achieve one or two victories, will ultimately be annihilated by them.’ Many of you also have such thoughts, right?!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some people immediately exclaimed, “No, no, we are not afraid of the Romans!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Captain, tell us who said such pessimistic words?!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some people remained silent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some nervous slave soldiers looked at Maximus, wondering in hushed voices, “What does he want to do?!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Don’t worry, let’s see what happens first,” Frontinus calmly reassured them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus waved his right hand forcefully and said resoundingly: “I can tell you very confidently that although we are weak now, we will soon become powerful. Although Rome is powerful now, they will gradually march towards destruction!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Why?” He softened his tone slightly and continued: “Many of you are from Illyria, Iberia, Greece, Asia Minor, Egypt, Gaul… and most of you became slaves because of Rome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “To obtain huge wealth from its provinces and client states, Rome sends tax collectors who impose very high taxes. The local officials then pass most of these taxes onto the ordinary civilians. These ordinary civilians cannot afford the taxes, so they have to borrow. It is said that these Roman tax collectors are the ultimate beneficiaries of provincial debts, so the interest is very high. Ordinary civilians who cannot repay their debts end up with destroyed families and enslaved…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some people led by Agnes showed sadness and began sobbing softly…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Rome also wants more land and slaves, so they frequently deploy armies and invade other territories. Gaul, Iberia, Asia Minor, Thrace… Many tribes and city-states have been conquered by Rome, and the people who once lived there freely have become slaves of Rome…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Some people around, led by Pigres, clenched their fists, their faces filled with resentment…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Rome continuously loots wealth, land, and population from various parts of the Mediterranean and brings it back to Italy. But tell me, did the lives of the Italian people become prosperous because of this? Are they living happily?!” Maximus asked loudly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The slave soldiers looked at each other, remaining silent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Cornelius and others unconsciously shook their heads, while Vorenus and others responded loudly, “No! No!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Why not?!” Maximus asked, raising his voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Vorenus stammered, unsure of how to answer, and the others remained silent.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I will tell you why!” Maximus looked at the crowd with a serious expression. “Indeed, in recent years, Rome extended citizenship to the entire Italy. All Italians no longer have to pay direct taxes. The soldiers who go to war and win can receive some spoils, and even when they retire, they can receive a small land…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “But in Italy, the number of bankrupted, landless civilians without a home is increasing every year. They either become vagrants, surviving on free bread, or they become slaves, working for the elites like cattle and sheep. I believe some of you have experienced such tragic situations.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Why is this the result?! That’s because the senators and patricians of Rome have the power, they possess the majority of the looted wealth, but they are still not satisfied with it. They have vast lands and countless cheap slaves, allowing their farms to produce agricultural products at very low costs, making it impossible for ordinary civilians to sell the food they have worked hard to cultivate for a year. Without money from selling the crops, they cannot live better lives, so they have no choice but to borrow money!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “And the lenders are often the elites of Rome. They have enormous wealth, but the interest rates they charge on loans are shockingly high. In the end, the ordinary civilians of Italy suffer the same fate as the ordinary civilians in other parts of the Mediterranean: they take away your land, making you their slaves, forcing you to continue working for them. How tragic it is!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus sighed deeply, and everyone around listened attentively, their expressions filled with sorrow and anger.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “These senators and patricians of Rome are so greedy, like a huge and ugly mosquito sucking blood from all of us. For the lowly Italian commoners, besides rising up in rebellion like we are doing, is there any normal way for them to change their own miserable fate?!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus asked again, but this time, his gaze turned to the group of slave soldiers led by Frontinus: “Perhaps there are other ways, but they are incredibly difficult! Several decades ago, some Roman elites, led by the Gracchi brothers, sympathized with ordinary civilians and proposed some beneficial suggestions. However, they were vehemently obstructed by the Roman senators. They even dispatched thugs to kill them!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Centuries ago, Roman plebeians, through prolonged struggles, forced the Roman Senate to establish the position of tribune of the plebs. A few elite plebeians could assume this position, which prevented any proposals detrimental to ordinary civilians from being passed. But now, the Roman Senate not only severely limits the power of the tribunes, but the dictator Sulla has made the position almost dispensable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The patricians have completely blocked the path for the plebeians to improve their status. Oh, and someone might say, ‘We can join the legion and rise to prominence like General Marius.’ But you must understand, that no matter how brave or talented you are, the highest you can reach is to become a centurion of a legion. But who gets appointed as the high-ranking commanders? The sons of elites of Rome! They don’t need to risk their lives rising up through the ranks like you do. Just by virtue of being born to privileged families, they can easily take the coveted high-ranking positions that are so difficult for you to attain. Then they reap the political capital from the victories you fight and bleed for, preparing them to become senior Roman officials or run for the consulship in the future.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “General Marius is just an exception. Despite so many common people serving in the Roman legions over the past few decades, he is the only one who has achieved such a high position. And don’t forget, he married a woman from the prestigious Julius family of Rome. He was already accepted as a Roman patrician, or else it wouldn’t have been so easy for him to become a Roman consul.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “As Roman plebeians serving as soldiers, not only do you have to shed blood and fight for these patricians to seize land and wealth, but you are also driven by their ambitions to kill each other. Even if you eventually obtain some land, in the end, it will be plundered back by them through various means. You will become homeless vagrants, losing your honor and dignity. How tragic it is!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus combined his knowledge of Roman history from his previous life with what he had seen and heard during this time, speaking passionately and eloquently.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Not only did the veterans of the logistics team listen and gain clarity, but even the slave soldiers led by Frontinus were deeply moved.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After all, even the Roman cultural elites of this era could not comprehensively analyze the current situation in Rome from political, military, economic, and other perspectives like Maximus. Although his words were simple, they were enough to enlighten these people who lived at the bottom of society, struggling daily for their livelihoods and having limited knowledge:\n    <em>\n     So, this is the source of our suffering!\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ***\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I used some terms interchangeably here.

The only way to free ourselves from their oppression and live a life of freedom is to take up arms and resist. Only by overthrowing them can we achieve true freedom!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “They may be powerful now, but in this world, there are ultimately fewer patricians and more plebeians. You have all seen how slaves and landless plebeians are everywhere in Italy, living aimlessly…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Now, we bravely rise up and declare war against them, just like lighting a torch in the darkness, showing them hope. That’s why we have rapidly grown from over 200 people to 5,000 in just a month! As news of our rebellion spreads, more people who harbor resentment towards the Roman elites will join us. When all the slaves and poor people of Italy are mobilized by us, can the Roman army withstand this massive force?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus raised his fist and spoke passionately, “So, in the end, we will surely defeat the Romans and successfully escape Italy to create a homeland of our own elsewhere! In this new homeland, we will not be discriminated based on race or social status. As long as you have talent, you can hold official positions and be promoted! In this new homeland, we will all have our own land, and with hard work, we can live fulfilling lives! In this new homeland, we commoners can also participate in political affairs. We can oppose proposals that would harm our interests, propose laws that would benefit us, and find ways to get them passed! Our elderly will be cared for, our children can receive education, and when we fall ill, we can receive affordable treatment. When we face disaster, our homeland will provide assistance…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone listened with fascination and yearning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “That’s incredible! It’s like a paradise!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “If we can really establish such a beautiful homeland, it would be worth dying for!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Captain Maximus, can we really build such a wonderful new home of our own?!” someone asked excitedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “As long as we work together and relentlessly strive for this goal, we will ultimately succeed!” Maximus said with unwavering confidence, infecting those around him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As they rejoiced and were filled with enthusiasm, Maximus, already a bit intoxicated and fueled by his own words, continued, “I want to tell you a story. Would you like to hear it?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We like to hear it!!” The veteran members of the logistics team responded in unison. The “Maximus’ Night Storytelling” had become a rare form of entertainment for them before going to sleep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The newly joined guards were also excited because they had heard that Maximus was a great storyteller, and tonight they would finally get to hear him firsthand.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Roman slave soldiers, however, were a bit bewildered. They didn’t understand why telling a story would excite others so much.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus took a sip of wine, looked up at the night sky, and slowly began, “…This story takes place in a distant, distant land in the East. There, vast fertile lands are inhabited by tens of millions of people, with dozens of kingdoms constantly warring and annexing each other. The wars lasted for centuries until one kingdom annihilated all the other forces, unifying the distant East.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “In theory, the king should have given a peaceful and secure life to the people who had endured the long years of war, allowing them to rebuild their homes. However, he imposed heavy labor on them, making the people tirelessly build city walls, construct tombs, and dig canals. He also implemented harsh laws, where even a minor offense would result in gouged eyes, severed hands, or chopped feet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The suffering of the common people became unbearable, and they finally rose up in rebellion against the king’s tyrannical rule, fighting against the powerful and numerous kingdom army. There were over a dozen rebel groups, most of which were led by the remnants of the nobility from the destroyed kingdoms. But only one group was led by a vagrant, and his subordinates included farmers, butchers, shepherds, bandits, and thugs… all composed of low-status commoners. The story I mainly want to tell is about him…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ……………………………………………………\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Night fell, the banquet had ended, and the bonfire was extinguished. Tranquility returned to the farm, and people began to fall asleep.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In Maximus’ bedroom, the internal meeting of the logistics team had just begun.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In addition to Maximus, those present included Agnes, who was in charge of kitchen affairs; Pigres, responsible for the wagon team; Cornelius responsible for managing the storage warehouse; Phaselus, in charge of the guard unit, as well as Sextus, who was recommended by Pigres and specifically responsible for livestock such as cattle and sheep. There was also Cassius Frontinus, whom Maximus specifically called for, and lastly, Vorenus, whom Maximus appointed to take notes.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As a freelancer and a bit of a homebody in his previous life, nighttime was when Maximus had the most energy. Even in this era, his habits hadn’t changed much. Without computers, internet, and other modern forms of entertainment, he expended his energy on teaching, storytelling, and holding meetings to avoid idleness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He scanned the people in the room: a cook, a destitute merchant, a farmer, a household slave, a gladiator, a retired veteran… He had all sorts of people under his command, and they were all of low status, but fortunately, each had some skills.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Everyone’s gaze was focused on Maximus. Previously, Maximus had often worked together with Agnes, Pigres, and the others, and their relationships were good. So they were happy to see Maximus take over the logistics team. After experiencing yesterday’s battle and tonight’s public speech, their respect for Maximus had grown, including Frontinus, because his wisdom had dispelled confusion and illuminated the way for them, something not anyone could achieve.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We’re short on time, so I won’t ramble on,” Maximus said directly. “We need to establish a medical team in our logistics team, and all the wounded will be under our care——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Agnes immediately exclaimed in surprise, “Ah, that’s hundreds of wounded men! Our team doesn’t have enough hands to care for them all, not to mention we don’t know how to provide that care!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The leaders have already decided, and we must follow through!” Maximus pretended to be helpless. He would never mention the fact that he had volunteered for this task himself. “Don’t worry, taking care of the wounded is not a complicated matter, and it doesn’t require too many people. Moreover, the leaders have promised to allocate more personnel to our logistics team in the future.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus did not plan to give them more opportunity for discussion, and said immediately: “Frontinus, who among your people is more skilled at caring for the wounded?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frontinus hesitated for a moment and replied, “Putrius Horatius, he’s a good person and patient. After our battles in the past, he always took the initiative to care for injured comrades.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Then let him temporarily be in charge of the medical team’s affairs. If he doesn’t perform well, we can replace him. He can select a few suitable assistants from your people.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After finishing, Maximus looked at Agnes, “As for cleaning wounds, applying medicine, and bandaging the wounded, I hope it will be done mainly by women from the kitchen. It’s best if they are younger and without husbands. Let them go to the newly established medical team to take care of the wounded.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Let our women take care of those men, and they have to be unmarried?! No, no, this is too much! Besides, we’re already short-staffed in the kitchen. If we lose more people, we won’t be able to handle the work!” Agnes vehemently opposed, shaking her head like a tambourine, her attitude seemingly resolute.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 40": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 40 – Arrangements\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    “Women are more careful and better at taking care of people. They can better comfort the wounded soldiers’ pessimistic emotions, which is beneficial for their better recovery. And, most importantly——” Maximus patiently and earnestly explained, “Agnes, you need to understand that although our group is composed of people who have suffered and endured hardships, due to traditional beliefs, women have a relatively low status within the group. They often face harassment from the soldiers, and these soldiers do not face any punishment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “But when the soldiers get injured, they often become pessimistic and desperate. Under the careful care of these women, when they heal, it’s as if they have gained a second life. These women would become their ‘mothers’ who give them a second chance at life. With that, how could the soldiers not greatly respect and appreciate them?! And when these wounded soldiers return to their respective units and spread the stories of what the women in the medical team have done, who would dare to bully them anymore? Won’t their status be elevated?!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Well… that… that’s true,” Agnes was moved, but still hesitated, “But the young women in our kitchen are our main workforce. If we assign them elsewhere, it will be difficult to complete the kitchen tasks, and if we can’t provide food to the soldiers on time…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “You don’t need to worry about that. Among the newly recruited slaves in the Roman army, many of them know how to cook and can temporarily help out in the kitchen.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Why temporarily? Because Maximus believed that this batch of legion slaves could play a bigger role, and it would be a waste to have them only as cooks.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The soldiers from the guard unit can also temporarily help you. As long as we get through one or two days, once the leaders agree to allocate the people promised to us, I can prioritize your selection. But I think, actually, you have quite a few people in the kitchen, but the efficiency of their work is not very high. With some changes, you can achieve more with fewer people, and you don’t have to be in the kitchen all day long, which is too tiring! We can discuss this after the meeting is over.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Agnes was born a farmer. She had never managed people before as a slave or as a cook. Since becoming the head in charge of the kitchen, she had been pondering every day on how to manage tasks and people. So when Maximus said this, she began to itch with curiosity. After all, this young leader of the logistics team had already demonstrated his wisdom multiple times before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus, of course, was unaware of her thoughts and continued, “After this victorious battle, we have gained many weapons, armor, several ballistae, and some military supplies. These are different from ordinary daily supplies and require knowledgeable individuals for specialized management. Otherwise, if they get damaged, it would be such a pity!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After saying this, Maximus glanced at Cornelius.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Captain Maximus is right. Weapons and armor are not easy to come by. I haven’t been in the army before, so I don’t know how to maintain them. It does require someone to specifically manage them,” Cornelius said nonchalantly, going with the flow. He didn’t mind it, as less work meant more free time for him.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Frontinus,” Maximus, relieved that Cornelius didn’t oppose, turned to Frontinus and asked, “Among your people, who would be suitable for managing these weapons and equipment?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frontinus pondered for a moment and replied, “Glaius Capito. He can read and write, and soldiers often rely on him to write letters or even keep their money safe.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Good, then let’s temporarily assign him to manage these military supplies,” Maximus decisively nodded, looking at everyone. He continued, “The leaders have decided that tomorrow the entire group will move to the nearby farm, where we will build a new camp. Our logistics team will be stationed there, so everyone needs to mobilize and work together, including the injured soldiers. So, Pigres, your wagon team——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Captain, although most of our wagons are intact, we don’t have many packhorses left,” Pigres was about to complain but was interrupted by Maximus, “Didn’t Commander Spartacus seize 15 wagons at the olive farm? Haven’t they been handed over to you?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Oh, I almost forgot,” Pigres patted his face sheepishly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “If we don’t have enough, I have already discussed it with Omarkel. We can temporarily borrow some of the warhorses they captured to use as packhorses——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Captain, warhorses aren’t meant for pulling wagons. They haven’t been trained, and it’s not easy to handle them,” Pigres reminded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus glanced at him and said, “That depends on the ability of your team. If I solve all your problems, then what’s the point of having you as the head of it?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I understand, I will find a solution,” Pigres quickly responded.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I have three oxen that can help pull the wagons,” Sextus spoke up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “You see, when you encounter difficulties, everyone is here to help you find a solution. So, there’s no need to worry,” Maximus said half-jokingly and half-seriously.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Encouraged by this, Pigres immediately said, “Captain, my team will do our best to safely transport all the wounded to the new camp!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Good!” Maximus said, then shifted his gaze to Sextus, the tall and lean Samnite from the Apennine Mountains, who resembled a stick. This was why he had been abandoned by other leaders and thrown into the logistics team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Sextus, although all the sheep in our logistics team have been eaten up, I believe it won’t be long before we acquire a new herd of sheep. Your livestock team doesn’t need to relocate with us. I have obtained permission from the leaders. Once the soldiers leave, this farm can be used to raise cattle and sheep.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “That’s great!” Sextus exclaimed happily. “During the day, I can let the cattle and sheep graze on the nearby hillside and herd them back to the farm at night. We won’t have to worry about losing them again. I can also raise some chickens and ducks on the farm…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus ignored Sextus’ muttering and turned to Frontinus: “After we relocate to the new base, I don’t plan to have the wounded soldiers stay inside the farm. I want to set aside a separate area outside the farm to erect tents for the wounded soldiers. However, I want these tents to be interconnected as much as possible, with good airflow, so the wounded soldiers can rest comfortably… How many tents do you think we need, and how should we set them up?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “How many wounded soldiers are there?” Frontinus asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “About 250.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “How many people do we have in the entire team?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Nearly 2,000.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frontinus thought for a moment and said, “We were responsible for transporting these military tents, and I remember it vividly because even though the legion only has 3,000 soldiers, the supplies were prepared for 5,000. I think Glaber had planned in advance and intended to call upon the city guards in Campania. I saw some tents burned in the camp this morning, but the remaining ones can fully meet the needs of the entire team…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As Frontinus spoke, he began gesturing with his hands. “The Roman army uses tents made of cowhide, with dedicated iron poles for support, so they are sturdy and not easily damaged. They are set up in a rectangular shape and can accommodate a small squad of 10 people resting inside. If only 6 people stay in one tent, it will be more spacious and comfortable. So, we will need more than 40 tents. As for making the tents interconnected and ensuring airflow, it’s quite simple. Just set up the tents close together, roll up the side cowhide, and they will naturally be connected.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “How long will it take to set them all up?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “We have 35 people to set up 40 tents. If we have some help… it will probably take an hour.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “That’s great. I’ll leave this task to you then. After we relocate to the new base tomorrow, you should take people to do it. Let me know how many people you need, but make sure to set up all the tents as soon as possible so that the wounded soldiers can move in immediately. It would be even better if there’s a surrounding wall or fence outside the tent area, to prevent disturbances from others in the future.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I’ll do my best,” Frontinus replied somewhat reluctantly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Frontinus,” Maximus looked at him solemnly and said, “You and your comrades possess the military skills we urgently need. Besides those responsible for the military supplies and managing the medical team, the rest of you will form a military advisory group, with you as the leader.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ***\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I’m a bit busy so I couldn’t update these past few days.

You will provide guidance. Or, for instance, when we have to engage in battle, how should we fight? You will develop the plan. After reaching a consensus through discussion, we will proceed with the battle according to the plan…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     Isn’t this similar to the camp commander in the Roman legion? No, it seems like it holds even greater authority than a camp commander…\n    </em>\n    Frontinus thought to himself.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     A young man responsible only for the logistics team wants to establish such a military-functional team. His ambitions must be high… But it’s not surprising. After all, he is someone capable of delivering such a speech and telling such a story.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “So, it’s called the Military Advisory Group, right? I think I can give it a try,” Frontinus replied casually, but there was a noticeable change in his gaze as he looked at Maximus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus seemed not to notice these changes and continued, “There’s a task that the Military Advisory Group needs to handle right now. Although we won the battle this time, it was a bit of a fluke. We were actually heavily defeated in the frontal confrontation yesterday. Therefore, the leaders are planning to conduct strict military training for the soldiers, and our guard unit should be no exception. I want you to lead the Military Advisory Group and provide rigorous training to our guard unit soldiers according to the requirements of the Roman legion. Can you do that?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Frontinus could respond, Phaselus interjected, “Maximus, our guard unit can train ourselves; we don’t need outsiders interfering.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Just train ourselves?” Maximus’ expression became serious, and he questioned, “Do you know how to lead the guard unit in a disciplined march? Do you know how to construct a defensive camp? Do you know how to form a battle formation during battle? Do you know how to use bronze trumpets and drums to command soldiers to charge or retreat…?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Phaselus was stunned by the barrage of questions and took a while to respond, “I know how to teach our brothers to fight the enemy!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Improving individual combat skills is just one basic skill for soldiers in warfare. We have a lot more to learn seriously so that we don’t repeat yesterday’s rout in the next battle,” Maximus said with a solemn expression. “Frontinus was once a centurion in the Roman legion and has extensive war experience. He will be an excellent teacher for us.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “He was a centurion in the Roman legion?!” Phaselus was surprised. He originally thought that Maximus valued Frontinus because he had been a slave in the Roman army for a long time, learning many skills. He didn’t expect him to have such a background.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The others also felt surprised, and their gazes towards Frontinus became more complex.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Hey!” Maximus shouted to remind everyone: “Don’t forget what I said in the courtyard earlier. Whether it’s a centurion or an ordinary Roman soldier, they are all of Italian plebeian origin. Frontinus went from being a centurion to being a slave, experiencing a lot of hardships. He has had similar experiences to us. Since he has joined us and will fight against Rome with us, he is now our brother, and we should warmly welcome him!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As Maximus finished speaking, Agnes immediately smiled and said, “Captain is right. Regardless of Frontinus’ previous identity, he is one of us now. Moreover, having a centurion in our logistics team makes me feel even safer!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Pigres reluctantly said, “I became a slave because Roman soldiers were indiscriminately capturing and enslaving people in Asia Minor. I feel only hatred, not goodwill, towards Roman soldiers. However, you used to be a Roman soldier and are now a slave, and the captain has spoken…Anyway, welcome to the logistics team.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “You’re a Sabine?” Cornelius asked.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frontinus was stunned for a moment and nodded, “Yes.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I noticed your accent earlier; it sounded familiar. I wanted to ask,” Cornelius smiled and continued, “Which town are you from?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Cures.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I was in Eretum before, not far from you,” Cornelius smiled even more, “We should spend more time together in the future.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Okay,” a hint of a smile finally appeared on Frontinus’ face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Wel…welcome to the transport team,” Sextus also chimed in, albeit with some nervousness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Phaselus quickly approached Frontinus, startling Maximus, who thought he might be hostile towards Frontinus. However, Phaselus had a smile on his face and warmly said, “So, you were once a centurion in the Roman legion. You should have better marching and fighting skills than me. You must teach me more in the future!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus breathed a sigh of relief, realizing that a conflict between them was unlikely given Phaselus’ character.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frontinus also breathed a sigh of relief. Seeing that everyone in the room eventually accepted him and the other military slaves after learning his true identity, it was evident that Maximus held significant prestige in the logistics team. Therefore, he spoke seriously, “The Military Advisory Group will conduct rigorous training for the guard unit. However, the guard unit has too few members, so it might be challenging to conduct formation training.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Start training first, more people will join later.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus’ reply further convinced Frontinus: that this young man would not be satisfied with just being a captain of the logistics team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus looked at the others and said, “It’s not just the guards who need training. During your free time, you should also lead your subordinates in training.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “What? We have to train too?!” Agnes exclaimed in surprise, and the others widened their eyes as well.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Yesterday, after our team was defeated and placed at the rear, according to the pre-arranged plan, we should have been able to retreat safely up the mountain. However, everyone panicked and disrupted the formation, resulting in so many casualties…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus’ expression turned solemn, and he spoke with a heavy tone, “Our battle with the Roman army will continue for a long time, and each battle may have its wins and losses. Our logistics team is weak in combat and carries a lot of provisions, making us a prime target for enemy attacks. I want you to undergo training, not to learn how to kill enemies, but to learn obedience, to follow commands, and how to quickly and safely evacuate in dangerous situations. Do you understand?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Yesterday’s events served as a wake-up call for Maximus because he remembered that in history, Spartacus’ rebel army was constantly on the move. The logistics team, due to carrying various supplies, was undoubtedly the slowest in action. If the team’s organization and crisis response capability were not strengthened, such a painful lesson would repeat itself time and time again.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    With his reminder, the others also realized this, and they all expressed their agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, Frontinus interjected, “In fact, the slaves responsible for doing miscellaneous tasks in the Roman legion also undergo some military training. It’s to ensure that they can keep up with the army’s movements and not slow them down.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus’ reminder, coupled with Frontinus’ support, finally made the others realize the importance of training, changing their reluctant agreement to active cooperation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “By the way, Frontinus,” Maximus remembered something and said, “In the past, I used to teach the members of the logistics team reading, and arithmetic, and tell them stories every evening, just like tonight. You can also be a teacher and impart knowledge to them.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Me? Be a teacher?” Frontinus’ expression became complex, and he waved his hands repeatedly, saying, “Oh, I can’t do that!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “You’ll be fine!” Maximus earnestly persuaded him, “You have such rich military experience that we don’t have. You can combine your own war experiences and tell us what we should pay attention to during regular training. What to consider when building a camp? How to prepare before a battle? How to kill enemies and protect ourselves during combat? You can even talk about a specific battle you participated in or a particular failure you encountered… I believe everyone would be very willing to listen to your stories and learn a lot from them!”\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 42": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 42 – Laws\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    Maximus’ words made Frontinus inexplicably excited. He had been a farmer in his youth, then became a refugee, and later joined the army after being recruited. He eventually became a centurion in the Roman legion, but that was just an ordinary position in the vast Roman army. After retiring, he became an ordinary farmer again, and later a slave… His life was ordinary, like a tiny speck of dust, unnoticed and seemingly meaningless. But now, he had the opportunity to become a teacher, and his words would be listened to by many, just like Maximus tonight. He would receive the respect he had never experienced before!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frontinus took a deep breath and said in a deep voice, “I can give it a try.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus observed the change in his expression, a slight smile forming at the corner of his mouth. “Then it’s settled!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He then turned to Phaselus and said, “Apart from training, it is your responsibility as the guard to ensure the safety of the logistics team. Starting tomorrow, you must take up this responsibility, especially since the women in our team are constantly harassed by soldiers from other teams. I hope such incidents will not occur again.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “But what if those soldiers don’t listen to our warnings and forcefully try to enter our camp? What if a conflict arises?” Phaselus showed a troubled expression, as he had heard about such incidents before.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Without hesitation, Maximus replied, “Then apprehend them and hand them over to me. Don’t worry about things escalating; I have a plan.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Alright, we’ll follow your lead.” Phaselus shrugged, showing a hint of helplessness.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus didn’t dwell on it and looked at the others again. He solemnly said, “Next, we have another important task at hand! Our logistics team has now grown to nearly 300 people, and it will continue to increase in the future. To prevent chaos, we must establish some regulations specifically for the logistics team to manage personnel and maintain overall stability. I have come up with a few, and I’d like to discuss them together to see if they are suitable for us.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Did the rebel army have laws? No, it didn’t. After all, the army had only been formed for a month, and they had been busy expanding the group and trying to survive. They hadn’t had the time to consider such matters. Even if they stabilized in the future, leaders like Spartacus might not immediately realize the importance of it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But Maximus was different. He came from China in his previous life and understood the importance of the rule of law. Moreover, he was a fan of Zhuge Liang, the great figure in Chinese history who attacked the powerful Wei Kingdom with the strength of a single province (and even launched six expeditions to Mount Qi). Despite the enormous expenditure of national resources and multiple military campaigns, the Shu Kingdom remained stable, with upright officials, submissive elites, and peaceful citizens. This was primarily achieved through the rule of law… Maximus wanted to be proactive, using laws to restrict his subordinates while the team was still weak, so that when it grew larger, there would be fewer obstacles.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Others didn’t think much of it, but Frontinus was shocked: Rome was a country that placed great emphasis on laws. From the establishment of the city-state to the present, countless laws and decrees had been enacted and passed. As a Roman citizen, he deeply understood this. And now, a small division of a rebellion, consisting of less than 300 people and occupying an area less than a mile, was going to establish laws!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frontinus had already been impressed by Maximus’ talent before, and now he looked at him with even greater admiration.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “This is Article 1,” Maximus raised a finger and said solemnly, “We are a rebel force against Rome. Anyone who voluntarily joins us should have that determination. If anyone tries to desert after joining or secretly colludes with the Romans to harm us, once discovered and captured, they will be executed. What do you think of this point?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Agreed!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Traitors should meet such a fate!” Agnes, Pigres, Phaselus, and Cornelius, along with Sextus, all exclaimed, nodding repeatedly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only Frontinus frowned slightly. He felt that the first point Maximus mentioned was probably mainly directed at them, the army slaves. So, he decided that after returning, he would remind his men to not be foolish.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Article 2: any resolutions passed in the meetings of our logistics team must be implemented seriously. Failure to implement or execute them properly will be considered dereliction of duty and will be punished!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After Maximus finished speaking, everyone was taken aback. It was evident that this point was directed at them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Article 3: each member of the logistics team must diligently fulfill their responsibilities. If anyone slacks off, they must also be punished.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Article 4: the supplies stored in the logistics team belong to the entire rebel group. No one is allowed to take them without permission, or they will face punishment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Article 5: members of the logistics team are not allowed to instigate trouble on their own, or they will be punished.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the rebel army had only recently been established, the members of the logistics team lived together, and they didn’t have any private property. Therefore, Maximus only came up with these five items for now.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After some discussion, the group didn’t add or remove anything, but they expanded on the details, such as determining the severity of the punishment based on the gravity of the offense.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the meeting, Maximus kept Agnes, Vorenus, and Phaselus behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “In the coming days, your guard unit should pay special attention to the Roman army slaves who have just joined our team. Be vigilant against anyone attempting to desert.” Maximus whispered to Phaselus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Ah? How is this possible?! Didn’t they all join us? I thought Frontinus was quite cooperative!” Phaselus exclaimed in surprise.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Spartacus told me that some of them were not very willing when they joined our group… Anyway, your guard unit should pay more attention to them. I don’t want to see someone violating the first law shortly after its issuance,” Maximus said in a low voice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He had given a speech and told a story tonight, even inviting Frontinus to their meeting, all in an effort to retain this group of Roman army slaves. He could see that Frontinus was somewhat loyal now, but despite Frantinus’ influence among those army slaves being relatively high, there was no guarantee that someone wouldn’t act foolishly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After Phaselus left, Maximus approached Vorenus. The former farm overseer had been diligently taking notes throughout the meeting without saying a word, thanks to his good education as a house slave.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus picked up the papyrus Vorenus had been writing on, where he had written down the tasks Maximus had assigned tonight and the five laws they had formulated, all clearly legible.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus nodded in satisfaction. “Very good, it’s written clearly. Tomorrow night, I will announce these laws to everyone. Vorenus, starting tomorrow, anyone who joins our logistics team will have to go through your screening process. Their background, ethnicity, experiences, and most importantly, their skills—such as carpentry, weaving, wheat cultivation, or sailing—should all be categorized by you to facilitate my task assignments.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I can handle these tasks, but I’m afraid we might run out of papyrus.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “That can be taken care of. I’ll ask the other leaders to collect more papyrus when they go out with their teams in the future.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After Vorenus left, only Agnes remained in the room. She couldn’t contain her excitement and asked eagerly, “Captain, tell me quickly, how can we make those guys in the kitchen work better?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Don’t rush,” Maximus analyzed for her clearly and at a slow pace, “You see, the tasks in your kitchen can be roughly divided into three categories: first is chopping wood and tending the fire, second is cooking porridge, meat, and soup, and third is baking bread.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Chopping trees and splitting wood is time-consuming and laborious. From now on, let the guard unit handle that. It will be just an additional military training for them, and your kitchen can save a lot of manpower. Instead, assign two or three people specifically responsible for tending the fires and keeping an eye on the stoves every day, ensuring that the fires don’t go out——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Captain, your solution solves a big problem for us!” Agnes exclaimed happily.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 43": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 43 – Camp Relocation\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    “You, on the other hand, try to control everything. Even if you stand in the kitchen watching over them every day, shouting and yelling, their efficiency won’t improve much. You should be good at delegating tasks to your subordinates and motivating them to work.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing her still confused, Maximus patiently explained, “Let’s take the example of cooking porridge, soup, and meat in the kitchen. You can divide the people who are good at these tasks into two or three groups, appoint a leader for each group, and assign them tasks. The group that performs the best and completes the tasks the fastest should be rewarded. For example, they can have half a day of extra rest, be given an extra piece of meat, or you can gather your subordinates regularly and publicly praise the best-performing group…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Despite Maximus’ confident explanation, in his previous life, he chose to become a freelancer because he disliked trouble and didn’t want to manage people. But in this chaotic world, he had to change his habits and learn how to work and manage people in order to ensure his own safety.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Agnes listened attentively, feeling excited. She said, “Captain, these methods you mentioned are all excellent! I… I will give them a try, but I’m not very clever, so I may not be able to do it well!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “No one is born knowing how to do everything. As long as you do your work seriously and make an effort, you will eventually succeed. Don’t worry!” Maximus encouraged her with empathy, because this was his experience during this time.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Agnes gained confidence from his words and immediately expressed her intention to implement these methods in the kitchen starting tomorrow.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Oh, and one more thing. When I saw you using the millstone to shell and grind the wheat, why didn’t you use donkeys to pull the millstone continuously? Instead, you often had people pushing it, which not only wasted manpower but also reduced efficiency,” Maximus pointed out.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “If we let the donkeys pull the millstone all the time, they would get exhausted. Besides, we have many people, so we take turns pushing the millstone. It’s not a big deal,” Agnes explained.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     Indeed, diligence and frugality are deeply ingrained in the hearts of these hardworking people…\n    </em>\n    Maximus smiled helplessly and said loudly, “Agnes, you must understand that now people are important, not donkeys! I will request Spartacus to help us acquire more donkeys so that they can do the work, and we only need one person to oversee them.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Well… alright,” Agnes reluctantly agreed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Don’t you feel that you have enough manpower available now? Can you allocate a group of young women to go to the medical unit, as I mentioned earlier?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Agnes thought for a moment, then said through gritted teeth: “I suppose it’s possible.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Who do you think is suitable to lead the group among those you’re going to send?” Maximus asked without hesitation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Nessia,” Agnes answered promptly, referring to a young and beautiful woman who was very familiar with kitchen affairs.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus nodded approvingly, imagining the image of the young and charming woman in his mind. He said, “It’s already late. You should go back and rest. Tomorrow, there will be a lot of work to do. After you go out, call the children in. They’re probably about to fall asleep.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After Agnes left, Maximus looked up at the dark night outside the window and stretched lazily. “I’ve accomplished quite a lot tonight. Tomorrow will be a new beginning!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ………………………………………………\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The next morning, after breakfast, the entire rebel army began to move camp to the farm below the mountain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although the distance between the two locations was short, the soldiers in each team appeared somewhat disorganized due to a lack of effective organization.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The logistics team had made prior arrangements, but they had to carry too many things, so their progress was relatively slow. As the leader, Maximus didn’t just sit back and relax. He personally took the lead in helping to carry and transport things and injured soldiers, and naturally, the others did not dare to be idle. The enthusiasm of the whole team was high, and by noon, the logistics team had settled into the farm.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following that, Frontinus set up military tents outside the farm gate with the 34 legion slaves, and Maximus led others to help.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Within two hours, all the medical team’s tents were set up.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Instead of immediately carrying the wounded soldiers inside, Maximus gathered the members of the medical team first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The newly formed medical team consisted of the newly appointed leader, Putrius Horatius, and five men who were also former Roman legion slaves. Agnes had sent 32 women from the kitchen, making a total of 38 people. The men and women gathered separately, very distinct from each other.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing this situation, Maximus playfully reminded, “Brothers and sisters, from now on, you have to work together. Don’t stand so far apart. Everyone, come closer.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Except for Horatius, these legion slaves were relatively young and had been eyeing these women for a while. However, considering that they were newcomers, they didn’t dare to make any moves. Now, upon hearing Maximus’ words, they immediately smiled and moved closer.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    On the other hand, these women from the kitchen had often been harassed by the rebel soldiers in the past month, so they were cautious and guarded. However, since Maximus had spoken, they reluctantly made a move, which showed Maximus’ prestige among the logistics team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Observing the situation, Maximus said with a serious expression, “Let me emphasize one thing: if both parties in our logistics team willingly engage in intimate relationships, I won’t say anything. However, if a woman disagrees and a man insists forcefully, the punishment can range from a beating to a fatal stab. So, before you make such a mistake, think carefully!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus was tall and robust, and now that he was leading a team, his stern expression carried a certain authority, causing these male slaves to feel a chill in their hearts. On the other hand, the women showed smiles, realizing that their leader was truly on their side.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus then turned his gaze to Horatius. This Roman veteran had a plain appearance and looked somewhat older than Frontinus, despite being younger: “Horatius, you are now the leader of our medical team——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Captain Maximus!” Horatius hastily interjected, “Don’t listen to what Frontinus said. I don’t know how to treat illnesses; I can only bandage wounds and take care of the injured. I’m willing to work in the medical team, but the position as the leader should be given to someone skilled in medicine.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus was satisfied with Horatius’ frank words and shook his head, saying, “My requirements for the leader of the medical team are, first and foremost, genuine concern for the wounded and having the patients’ well-being in mind. Secondly, the ability to manage the team and command them to better take care of the patients, and handle any unexpected situations the medical team may encounter during the war. As for medical skills, whether good or not is irrelevant to being able to lead the team.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After listening, Horatius thought carefully and said, “Then I can give it a try.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I have a few requirements for the medical team,” Maximus went straight to the point, looking at him. “First, separate the seriously wounded and those who cannot walk from the ordinary wounded and prioritize their care. Second, your medical team’s camp must maintain cleanliness, with no garbage or excrement accumulation, and minimize the presence of mosquitoes and rats inside the tents. Third, use boiled water to clean wounds, and the bandages used for dressing wounds must be soaked in boiling water and dried before use. Fourth, the task of cleaning wounds and taking care of the injured will mainly be assigned to the women.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After Maximus finished speaking, the women didn’t seem to mind much since most of them didn’t have experience in caring for the wounded. However, a few male slaves began to discuss among themselves, “We’ve taken care of injured comrades before, but we’ve never had so many troublesome tasks.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Yeah, taking care of the wounded shouldn’t involve cleaning the tents and boiling water to soak bandages… I’ve never heard of it!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “If you want to slack off and don’t want to work hard, then leave the medical team right away. Don’t make a fuss here!” a woman stood up and scolded loudly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    She was a 20-year-old girl with soft black long hair, slightly dark skin, captivating brown eyes, a small and straight nose, slightly thick lips, and a graceful figure.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the woman scolding them was beautiful, the male slaves immediately retorted unwilling to show weakness: “Who are you? Do you even know how to take care of wounded soldiers?”\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 44": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 44 – Horatius and Nessia\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     New Translator:\n     <strong>\n      Phos\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ***\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Her name is Nessia, the head nurse of the medical team and also the deputy leader!” Maximus exclaimed loudly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nessia, a Greek slave, was bought by an overseer from a nearby farm to be a concubine. She suffered various abuses and had two miscarriages. When the rebels attacked the farm where she was, she incited the slaves on the farm to kill the overseer and his subordinates directly and joined the rebels. She appeared delicate on the outside, adept at socializing, but her inner strength and endurance were remarkable.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Upon hearing Maximus’ words, Nessia was both surprised and puzzled: “What is a head nurse?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “A soldier who takes care of the wounded is called a nurse, and the leader of the nurses is called the head nurse,” Maximus intentionally distorted the meaning of nurse.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nessia and the other women immediately showed delight. Being referred to as “soldiers” clearly elevated their status within the rebel group.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nessia continued to ask, “What if these wounded soldiers, while we are taking care of them, behave rudely towards us? How should we handle it?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus spoke sternly, “Every wounded soldier who enters the medical team’s camp should be reminded in advance. If there is any harassment, you can issue a warning. If they continue to cause trouble after the warning, they will be expelled from the medical team’s camp. We won’t accept such wounded soldiers!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Understood!” Nessia smiled, satisfied with Maximus’ response.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    While the others were clamoring noisily like the legion slaves, Horatius, who had been lost in thought since hearing Maximus’ requirements, finally asked, “Why do we need to boil water to soak the linen used for dressing wounds?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus was prepared for this question and answered earnestly, “We often see countless small insects at the bottom of ditches in the wild. In fact, these are only the ones we can see. There are also unseen insects around us that thrive on filth. They can cause high fever and illness. Usually, our skin acts as armor, tightly protecting us, and coupled with our strong bodies, we can live normally. However, if we are injured and physically weakened, they can easily enter our bodies through the wounds, causing the wounds to fester, high fever, and ultimately death. High temperatures can kill these insects, and a clean environment can also reduce their presence…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus’s words not only startled Horatius but also made the others nervously glance around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus’s serious look left Horatius half-believing and half-doubting. He eagerly asked, “From which physician did you learn all this that you speak of?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus was too lazy to explain further to Horatius and emphasized, “Don’t worry about where I learned it from. Just follow these instructions for now and see if it works after a while. If it works, we’ll continue with it. If not, then we can go back to your original methods of caring for the wounded. How about that?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Horatius had never studied medicine, so he did not adhere to any particular theory that would cause him to reject other “heresies.” Instead, he felt that what Maximus said made some sense. Moreover, as a farmer by birth, he did not mind doing a bit more work.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Alright, let’s give it a try as you suggested.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This response relieved Maximus, who had already made up his mind that if Horatius had opposed the idea, he wouldn’t have minded finding another obedient person to be the leader of the medical team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus looked at Nessia and then at Horatius, speaking earnestly, “I hope both of you will work together to make our medical team successful and help more wounded soldiers recover!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nessia immediately expressed her support, saying, “I will fully cooperate with the leader of the medical team and lead our sisters to do our best!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Horatius, on the other hand, said, “I’ve never been a leader before, so I don’t know if I can do a good job, but I’ll do my best!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     Such an honest man!\n    </em>\n    Maximus had a good impression of Horatius upon this first meeting.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a simple plan was made for the medical team’s camp based on the severity of the soldiers’ injuries, they began carrying the wounded into the tents.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, Maximus approached Nessia and whispered, “Nessia, I’ll give you another task. While you lead our sisters in taking care of the wounded, you can subtly persuade them to stay with our logistics team after they recover.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This was another purpose of Maximus in establishing the medical team. Since the leaders were reluctant to allocate more soldiers to the logistics team, he would recruit from among the wounded soldiers. After all, the rebel army accepted new members on a voluntary basis, but most people didn’t understand the internal situation of the rebel army, so they just followed orders. If the wounded soldiers insisted on staying with the logistics team, it would be difficult for others to object. Moreover, the wounded soldiers had already experienced battles and had better qualities than new recruits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I understand. We will persuade them discreetly,” Nessia whispered back, throwing him a flirtatious gaze. “If I do well, Captain, how would you thank me?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus’s heart skipped a beat as he met her gaze, but he maintained his composure and said, “If you do well, it means I didn’t pick the wrong person.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Nessia’s eyes danced on Maximus’ face, and she giggled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Of course, it wasn’t just the medical team that carried the wounded into the tents. Maximus also called in the guards to help, so within half an hour, all the wounded soldiers were properly settled.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Afterward, Maximus tirelessly went around comforting each wounded soldier and intentionally told them that he had personally applied to the leaders to establish the medical team and would ensure their recovery process was fully supported.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the soldiers were wounded, the rebel army had been busy for the past two days. As a result, they were left behind with no one to take care of them, and their spirits were very low. Now, hearing that the logistics team specifically sent women to take care of them, they suddenly felt like they had gone from hell to heaven. They were not only grateful to Maximus but also promised to respect these women who would take care of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Following Horatius’ orders, several legion slaves started chopping firewood and preparing to boil water outside the medical team’s camp. Horatius began carefully instructing Nessia and the others on how to clean the wounds of the wounded soldiers, how to stop bleeding, and how to bandage them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing that the medical team’s work was starting to progress smoothly, Maximus quietly left. Thinking back to the grateful eyes of the injured soldiers just now, he decided to come here every day to win the favor of these wounded soldiers. It was a beneficial thing without any cost.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …………………………………………………\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the rebel army had only 2,000 soldiers, the makeshift camp previously built by the Roman army on the olive oil farm could easily accommodate them. However, even so, the soldiers were busy all day and didn’t settle down until late at night.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Early the next morning, Spartacus and Crixus led the troops, escorting the hundreds of Campanian prisoners, and headed to Naples.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Naples was located northwest of the rebel army’s current camp, just ten kilometers away.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    By noon, the troops arrived at the outskirts of the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Neapolitans had already received news of the rebel army’s approach and had closed the city gates long ago. The city guards were all stationed on the city walls, ready to face a formidable enemy.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus shouted loudly from below the city, declaring that they had risen up in resistance because they could no longer endure the oppression of the Romans. They had no ill intentions towards Neapolitans. However, Naples had aided the Romans by sending troops to assist the Roman army in attacking their camp. Now that the Roman army had been annihilated, and the majority of Campanian soldiers, mainly from Naples, had been captured, the rebel army had decided to punish the people of Naples. Unless Naples presented 500 sets of armor, 500 short swords, 500 spears, and 500 shields in exchange for the lives of these prisoners, they would all be executed right in front of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus’ proclamation caused a commotion among the officials, senators, and the city guards who were watching from the city walls.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Through the defeated soldiers who had escaped and returned yesterday, Neapolitans had already learned of the disastrous defeat of the Roman army. The families of soldiers who had not seen their loved ones return were already preparing for funerals, and the city was filled with mourning.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now they saw that so many Neapolitan soldiers were still alive, and they were crying out in despair at the outskirts of the city. Most of the people wanted to agree to Spartacus’ conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ***\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hi readers, Phos here.

It also had the busiest port for maritime trade in central Italy. They not only had the required quantity of weapons and armor, but they could also afford it. The Neapolitan soldiers sent to fight were not refugees but rather the people of Naples who owned land and assets (and were also Roman citizens). The officials of Naples had previously agreed to Glaber’s request and sent city guards to assist the Roman army. Now, with most soldiers not returning, they faced the blame of the city’s population for suffering a disastrous defeat. If they could save some of the prisoners, it would alleviate the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, the chief magistrate of Naples disagreed. As a Roman himself and the appointed chief magistrate of Naples by the Roman Senate, he would not allow these rebellious slaves to obtain weapons and armor, which would strengthen their power and make it harder for the next Roman army to suppress them. Although the rebel army outside the city was fully armed, except for not carrying the eagle standard, they appeared like a Roman army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The opposition of the chief magistrate of Naples led to a deadlock between the two sides on the city walls.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rebel army had been waiting outside the city for a long time without a response. Crixus, becoming impatient, immediately grabbed five prisoners from the captives and brought them to the front of the troops. Without saying a word, he stabbed each of them to death with a short sword.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There was an outcry from the city.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus threatened loudly, “If Naples does not provide a satisfactory response, I will kill a batch of prisoners at regular intervals!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing the tearful pleas of the prisoners below the city and facing the accusations of others above, the chief magistrate of Naples dared not persist. Otherwise, the anger of the entire city would make his life difficult within Naples.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Neapolitans agreed to the demands of the rebel army, but out of fear, they did not dare to open the city gate. They proposed that the requested weapons and armor would be transported by ship to a port outside the city, and the released prisoners would be picked up by ships (at that time, Naples had developed maritime trade, and its ports were scattered throughout the Gulf of Naples).\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus agreed to this.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The exchange that made the people of Naples anxious was eventually completed relatively smoothly. The rebel army fulfilled its promise, and all the Campanian prisoners were released.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Neapolitans breathed a sigh of relief, but they did not know that while Naples prospered from maritime trade, that prosperity was built on the blood and sweat of thousands of dock workers. The dashing appearance of the rebel army at the port would soon spread throughout Naples’ dozen-odd ports and reach the ears of countless suffering lower-class people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rebel army obtained the weapons and armor they desired and returned satisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The rebel soldiers were usually just following Spartacus and the other leaders to occupy farms and kill the overseers and guards they hated. They couldn’t sense the impact this rebellion would have on this world. But today, they saw the high and mighty Neapolitan nobles cower and submit under their show of force. This brought them immense satisfaction and increased their sense of belonging to the rebel army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus sensed the change in the soldiers’ morale and discussed with Crixus: should they lead the army to nearby towns for armed demonstrations periodically? Not only could they threaten the Roman nobles to provide some much-needed supplies, but it would also boost the morale of the new recruits.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Just then, several riders galloped forward, with Omarkel in the lead. He waved and shouted, “Commander Spartacus! Commander Crixus! Something bad has happened!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus and Crixus were both shocked. “What happened?!” they exclaimed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The logistics team… and the soldiers of the Second Cohort…\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#gem-novels-note-1\" id=\"gem-novels-note-link-1\">\n      [1]\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    got into a fight!” Omarkel rushed to their side, panting heavily.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, considering the Neapolitans’ weak military strength, Spartacus and Crixus didn’t take all of their soldiers with them. Instead, they left some soldiers behind to receive military training from Hamilcar, along with soldiers from other teams. After a morning of training, the soldiers replenished their water and food supply and needed some rest before continuing their training.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    During this break, a few soldiers from the Second Cohort sneaked into the medical team’s camp, attempting to harass the nurses. However, they were stopped by the logistics team’s guards who arrived upon hearing the news. Instead of heeding the warning, they became even more furious and started fighting with the guards. The guards outnumbered them and quickly subdued several troublemakers, but one of them realized the situation was turning against them and slipped away, spreading rumors like “the logistics team is bullying our brothers with their numbers” among the soldiers. This immediately ignited the anger of some soldiers, who gathered and headed towards the medical camp…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soon, during the midday break, Hamilcar received a report while resting in his tent: some soldiers from the Second Cohort were involved in a brawl with the guards in the medical camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar hurried to the scene and found the situation to be true, with the conflict escalating. He quickly stepped forward to intervene, but the fired-up soldiers of the Second Cohort paid no heed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At that moment, Omarkel approached and reported that Spartacus and Crixus had successfully completed their previous plan and were on their way back with the army.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar couldn’t afford to rejoice; he instructed Omarkel to immediately notify Spartacus and Crixus to rush over and quell the situation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “What caused the conflict in the first place?” Spartacus, though anxious, wanted to clarify the reasons first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I just arrived there myself, so I’m not entirely sure about the situation. But I heard it was because the guards detained several soldiers from the Second Cohort——”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Before Omarkel could finish his sentence, Crixus erupted in anger, “The logistics team has some nerve! How dare they detain my brothers! How does Maximus control his troops?!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Crixus, don’t be hasty. Maximus has always acted with restraint. There must be a reason behind this. Let’s first understand the situation before jumping to conclusions,” Spartacus quickly advised.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I think we’ve given him too much power, making him too arrogant and out of control!” Crixus snorted angrily, grabbed a horse from a member of the reconnaissance team, and leaped onto it, galloping ahead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, Spartacus couldn’t immediately abandon the troops and leave. He first entrusted the leadership task to his trusted centurion and former gladiator, Agorius, and gave him a few instructions before following Omarkel on horseback.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus arrived at the camp and from afar, he could see hundreds of people densely gathered outside the medical camp, blocking the entrance and exit. Many were shouting loudly, but he didn’t hear any sounds of fighting or screams.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “What are you all doing here, blocking the way? Get out of my sight!” Crixus shouted loudly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “It’s Commander Crixus!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Commander Crixus, you’ve finally returned! Several of our brothers have been detained by the logistics team’s guards, and they won’t release them!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Commander Crixus, when you’re not around, we suffer from mistreatment! Commander Hamilcar and Commander Artorix are favoring the logistics team. They even sent the Third Cohort to assist the guards in driving us out of the medical camp.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The more Crixus listened, the darker his face became. Unable to contain himself any longer, he yelled, “Enough, I’ve heard it all!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldiers of the Second Cohort immediately stopped complaining, and even the soldiers from the Fourth Cohort who had come to watch the commotion voluntarily cleared the way. Crixus walked forward with large strides until he stood in front of a row of disciplined soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “What? You dare to block my path?!” Crixus glared fiercely at them, his eyes filled with hostility.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Commander Crixus, the two commanders, Hamilcar and Artorix request your presence for a discussion.” The speaker was a centurion from the Third Cohort and also a former gladiator who was familiar with Crixus. He glanced behind Crixus and continued, “To prevent further conflicts, everyone else must wait outside for the time being.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus stared at him, and the centurion met his gaze without flinching.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After a moment, Crixus turned around and shouted, “What are you lot still doing here? Go about your own business!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The centurion turned and walked inside, the soldiers making way to create a path. Crixus, with a dark expression on his face, followed closely behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Entering the medical camp, three people stood in the open space in front of the tents: Hamilcar, Artorix, and Maximus.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as Hamilcar saw Crixus, he immediately explained, “Crixus, you’ve finally returned. I was afraid the conflict would escalate, so I had to ask for Artorix’s help. I called in the Third Cohort to forcibly separate your soldiers from the logistics team’s guards.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus didn’t even look at him and charged straight toward Maximus, cursing, “Maximus, you’ve really done it this time!” As he spoke, he raised his fist and aimed for Maximus’ face.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <div class=\"tl-notes mt-5\">\n     <b>\n      Translator's Notes:\n     </b>\n     <ol>\n     </ol>\n    </div>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <li id=\"gem-novels-note-1\">\n     First to Fifth\n     <strong>\n      Team\n     </strong>\n     -&gt; First to Fifth\n     <strong>\n      Cohort\n     </strong>\n     <a href=\"#gem-novels-note-link-1\">\n      ↩︎\n     </a>\n    </li>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 46": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 46 – Soldiers’ Assembly\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    Translator: Phos\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ***\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus’ furious appearance resembled that of a ferocious wolf ready to devour its prey, making Maximus feel a bit apprehensive. However, with dozens of eyes from the medical team watching behind him, as their leader, he couldn’t back down! So, after swiftly dodging the incoming punch, he retaliated with a punch of his own.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     How dare this traitor fight back?!\n    </em>\n    Crixus grew angrier, shifting his body to the side, pushing off with his right foot, and charging forward with great force.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus couldn’t evade in time and was knocked down by Crixus. The two of them started wrestling on the ground…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soon, a pair of powerful hands forcefully held Crixus back, while Hamilcar helped Maximus, who had taken two punches, to his feet.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus released Crixus and yelled angrily, “Both of you are leaders of your respective teams. Why can’t you discuss things properly instead of fighting like ruffians here? Is this how you set an example for our brothers!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “This traitor dared to detain our brothers from my Second Cohort. Why shouldn’t I punch him?” Crixus remained furious but refrained from attacking again. He glared at Hamilcar and Artorix, saying, “And you two, you actually sided with him to bully my Second Cohort!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hamilcar replied sternly, “The reason the guards detained several soldiers from the Second Cohort is that they intruded into the medical team’s camp, harassed the women who were tending to the wounded, and caused chaos within the medical team. It is the duty of the guards to detain them to protect the entire logistics team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Not only did these soldiers from the Second Cohort attack our own comrades and disrupt the medical team, but one of them escaped the pursuit of the guards and returned to spread rumors within the Second Cohort, instigating them to brawl with the guards. If it weren’t for the timely arrival of the Third Cohort to intervene, it could have led to internal conflict. That’s why I request strict punishment for these soldiers,” Hamilcar explained firmly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus was momentarily stunned. He hadn’t expected the situation to be like this, but then he dissatisfiedly said, “Hamilcar, you’re exaggerating too much. These brothers just wanted to relax a bit amidst the tense military training. They used to do this quite often, not just them, haven’t the members of your own team do the same?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus mockingly looked at them, then at Spartacus, and finally locked his gaze on Maximus, saying, “It was merely a way for the soldiers to relax under the pressure of the imminent Roman attack. It used to be no big deal. But today, Maximus, you specifically targeted my team and detained them, which sparked the anger of the Second Cohort. So, the ones truly responsible for this are Maximus and the guards!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus chuckled in anger, not even bothering to look at Crixus. He turned his head towards Spartacus and said seriously, “We formed this army to resist the Romans and grant freedom to all those who have suffered. Our brothers and sisters of the logistics team believed in us and joined our ranks. They worked tirelessly day and night, preparing delicious meals for our fellow brothers. They saw so many injured comrades and felt their pain, so they volunteered to take care of them. Our brothers and sisters of the logistics team genuinely consider everyone in the entire rebel army as a family!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “But certain soldiers from different teams, and even some leaders, fail to see the efforts of the logistics team, and did not even regard the women of the logistics team as their family. They have barely escaped from the Roman nobles’ farming estates themselves, yet they shamelessly harass our sisters in the logistics team who have also suffered. What’s the difference between their behavior and that of the Roman nobles or farm overseers? Are we risking our lives and started a rebellion only to become the people we despise?!” Maximus passionately questioned, each word piercing into the hearts of everyone present.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    His voice was loud and clear, audible to the countless soldiers who had been gossiping and watching the scene unfold. They suddenly fell silent, even some unconsciously lowering their heads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “The humiliation of the women in the logistics team must be stopped. Otherwise, it will only disappoint those who genuinely care for our cause and fight wholeheartedly for our goals! This time, we must severely punish these soldiers who have committed wrongdoings and restore our discipline!” Maximus concluded with a resounding call.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “This is absolutely not possible!” Crixus instinctively voiced his opposition.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Spartacus, who was not particularly concerned about the soldiers harassing the women of the logistics team, was deeply moved by Maximus’ words. He also noticed the strong reactions of the soldiers outside the medical camp upon hearing these words. So, after giving it some thought, he asked earnestly, “How do you propose to punish them?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Public flogging!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “This is absolutely unacceptable!” Crixus strongly objected again. “It would be a great humiliation to our brothers!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Isn’t it a great humiliation to harass the members of the logistics team?!” Maximus retorted loudly, pointing towards the wooden sign in the camp. “There is a sign clearly stating, ‘Anyone who intrudes into the medical camp without permission will be punished.’ Your soldiers knowingly violated this rule and should face severe punishment!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Who can understand what you’ve written on that sign?!” Crixus shouted. “Besides, you are arbitrarily setting rules without our permission!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Alright, everyone, stop arguing!” Spartacus said in a deep voice. “How about this? Let’s hold a soldiers’ assembly and let our brothers decide whether or not to punish them.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Hearing this, Maximus pretended to hesitate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus, without any hesitation, said, “Fine, I agree!” Because he believed that the soldiers of the Second Cohort, who accounted for a quarter of the entire army, would definitely support their comrades, and soldiers from other cohorts had also gone to the logistics team to do this kind of thing in the past, so of course, they would not agree either. Maximus’ proposal could not possibly be approved by the majority of soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Alright,” Maximus said, sounding somewhat helpless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Soon, the soldiers were gathered together, sitting in a circle with the members of the logistics team. Spartacus stood in the center of the camp and impartially recounted the events of the conflict that had occurred earlier this day.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then, it was Crixus who walked to the center of the camp, strongly demanding to go first. He escorted the four soldiers who had caused trouble, and they no longer displayed the nervousness they had when they were detained. Upon hearing their names shouted by the soldiers of the Second Cohort, they even arrogantly waved back.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus then briefly introduced their names to the entire rebel group, and then described in detail their brave performances in two battles against the Roman army—how many enemies they killed, how many comrades they rescued, and so on—he deliberately omitted their intrusion into the medical camp.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the soldiers around them occasionally expressed admiration, the four individuals held their heads high.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Brothers, you are all warriors because you dare to fight against the mighty Romans! As warriors, we should be respected and taken care of, shouldn’t we?!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Yes!!!” the soldiers shouted in unison.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Seeing the enthusiastic response from the soldiers, Crixus excitedly shouted again, “Brothers, I believe you would never want to see your comrades, who fought side by side with you, subjected to such disgusting humiliation over such a trivial matter, right?!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Right!!” The response was slightly quieter, but it still appeared to be more than half, which satisfied Crixus. When he left the stage, he glanced at Maximus with disdain.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “What now? It seems these bastards won’t be punished!” Agnes felt nervous.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Our leader hasn’t appeared yet; he should have a solution, right?” Nessia felt equally anxious.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “If these soldiers dare to let these bastards go unpunished, then our logistics team won’t cook for them anymore!” Agnes angrily exclaimed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “If you do that, Maximus won’t be able to remain as our leader!” Pigres reminded her.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “You—Pigres, whose side are you on?!” Agnes angrily exclaimed.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 47": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 47 – Bubius and Tolerugo\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    Frontinus, who was standing aside, ignored their quarrel. He didn’t really care whether or not these few individuals would be punished. He focused on the center of the gathering, scanning the lively crowd around him. What interested him was the way the rebels sought the opinions of everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Although there were many military laws in the Roman army and military discipline was quite strict, with his years of military career, he knew: in reality, the power of life and death over a legionary soldier was ultimately decided by the legion commander, and ordinary soldiers had no opportunity to appeal. The rebel army did not yet have military laws, yet it seemed to be giving this punitive power to the soldiers. Was this the so-called freedom?\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus walked into the center of the camp, followed closely by two young women who looked frightened. They were thin and had swollen eyes, and one of them even had a clear red handprint on her cheek.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldiers curiously looked at Maximus standing in the center. In all honesty, many recruits probably didn’t know this young leader of the logistics team just two days ago. But it wasn’t surprising. The new recruits were busy raiding farms every day and had little interaction with Maximus, who always stayed with the logistics team. It was only when they fought against the Roman army and ultimately retreated to the mountains that Maximus stepped forward and pointed out a way to turn defeat into victory, attracting everyone’s attention for the first time. And now, he once again became the focus of everyone’s attention, but this time it was to punish their comrades, which caused mixed feelings among the soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus didn’t know the soldiers’ conflicting emotions at the moment. His voice was loud and carried a hint of gravity as he introduced the two women to the soldiers and emphasized the hardships they had endured.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Endless labor driven by whips and sticks was the shared ordeal of every slave in the camp. But young female slaves with some beauty had to endure some unspeakable violations and suffering, similar to what Nessia had experienced.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Perhaps Maximus’ narration brought back the terrible memories for the two women, and they couldn’t help but start weeping.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus stopped speaking and raised his voice, saying, “These two women joined our ranks with hope, thinking they had come from hell to paradise. They work tirelessly every day to prepare delicious food for everyone, and now they actively care for the wounded. But their enthusiasm has been met with the shameless violation by these few individuals!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus’ strong accusation silenced the entire assembly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus began to feel uneasy but quickly relaxed. He understood his soldiers well. Perhaps they felt guilty now, but Maximus’ continued accusations would only make them support the innocence of those four individuals because that was the only way they could feel innocent themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus looked around and said, “I believe all of you heard what I said in the medical camp. I don’t intend to say much more. I would like to invite two other people to speak to everyone.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Two other people?” Crixus was a bit surprised, but then he saw Maximus escorting the two women out of the center of the gathering, followed by another person entering.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This person leaned on a wooden stick, with his right leg wrapped in linen. After awkwardly positioning himself in the center, there was a commotion among the soldiers of the Second Team.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I… I am Bubius from the Second Cohort,” he said nervously. “Two days ago, during the battle with the Romans… I was stabbed in the leg by a Roman short sword… I ran for my life… ran… and barely escaped their pursuit, making it to the mountain. Afterward, the wound on my right leg became swollen and painful, to the point where I couldn’t sleep. I even wished to just chop off my right leg to end my agony…\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “My comrades were busy descending the mountain to raid the Romans and relocate our camp. No one noticed how much pain I was in! For two consecutive days, I hardly ate or slept. I felt weak all over, unable to even open my eyes. I thought I was going to die…” Bubius became more excited as he spoke, his words flowing more smoothly this time. “Fortunately, the logistics team established a medical team, and those women became the nurses who cared for us wounded soldiers. They carefully cleaned my wounds, bandaged them, and even fed me, comforting me and telling me not to worry… Just after one night, I could already stand up with the support of a wooden stick!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bubius, overwhelmed with emotion, even shed tears. Choking up, he continued, “In my entire life, apart from my mother when I was young, no one has shown me such care! They are such good people! Alexius, you damned bastards! How dare you violate them? You are unworthy of being my comrades; you should be punished!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Bubius forcefully slammed the ground with the wooden stick, shouting in anger. The assembly immediately became chaotic.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crixus felt a strong sense of unease and urgently asked several centurions under his command, “Is he truly a soldier from the Second Cohort?!” The Second Cohort already had over a thousand soldiers, and their time together was still relatively short, so it was impossible for Crixus to know everyone.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Bubius is indeed a soldier in our team,” one centurion replied.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “This cunning Maximus!” Crixus muttered under his breath. At this moment, he felt somewhat helpless.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Then he saw four guards carrying a wooden frame into the center of the gathering, with a person lying on it. When the person was helped up by the guards, Crixus saw his face and immediately felt a tremendous shock.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tolerugo, a gladiator from Gaul, had a good relationship with Crixus and served as a centurion of the Second Cohort. During the battle against the Roman army, the Second Cohort suffered a disastrous defeat. Tolerugo, however, fought to the death and managed to break free from the Roman encirclement, leading his soldiers to escape the pursuit of the Roman cavalry and retreat to the mountain. While the soldiers celebrated their rescue, Tolerugo collapsed to the ground, covered in sword wounds. The blood flowing from his body dyed his armor red. Even Crixus, upon seeing him, believed that his injuries were so severe that he wouldn’t survive for long. He never expected to see Tolerugo appear in the center of the assembly at this moment.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In fact, the majority of the severely wounded in the medical camp were gladiators. Their fierce resilience and experience in the arena allowed them to reach safe zones even with severe injuries. Tolerugo was just one of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “These soldiers deserve to die!” Despite his pale and weak appearance, Tolerugo’s angry expression shook the soldiers around him as soon as he spoke.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “I am alive here today because of the careful care of these women! Any bastard who harasses them is an enemy of mine and other wounded soldiers! Anyone who agrees that these bastards should go unpunished, the next time you get injured I will recommend to the medical team to not treat you, and let you fools die wailing in pain!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Tolerugo’s impassioned words caused even greater turmoil among the soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <em>\n     Damn, Maximus!\n    </em>\n    Crixus cursed internally. He didn’t know the situation in the other cohorts, but Tolerugo, known for his straightforward nature in the Second Cohort, had considerable influence. After being berated by him like this, there were likely very few people left supporting those soldiers.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Meanwhile, Maximus quietly praised Nessia, saying, “It’s great that Tolerugo stood up to support you. You all did well!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “All the sisters followed your orders and took care of these severely wounded soldiers with all their hearts and efforts.” Nessia didn’t sound proud; instead, she complained, “They can’t move, and we have to bandage their wounds, clean their bodies, even handle their excrement and urine. It’s not only tiring but also…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “But it’s all worth it, isn’t it?” Maximus pointed to Tolerugo in the center of the assembly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    At this moment, Tolerugo was carried away, and Spartacus entered the center again. “Now that both sides have presented their reasons, my brothers, I believe you have made your decisions. So, those in favor of punishment, raise your arms!”\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 48": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 48 – Rome Sends Troops Again\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    This method of judgment was rather simple but at least better than the previous Spartan Citizens’ Assembly (the Spartan Citizens’ Assembly or\n    <em>\n     Ecclesia\n    </em>\n    where proposals were decided based on the loudness of citizens’ shouts). Moreover, most of the soldiers raised their hands, so there was no need for further counting. After all, the testimonies of the two injured soldiers had made them aware of the significance of these women in the uprising.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “More than half of our brothers believe that they should be punished. According to the proposal of the leader of the logistics team, Maximus, they should be publicly flogged!” Spartacus said with a dignified expression.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When Maximus initially proposed forming a medical team, Spartacus didn’t find it particularly novel since the Roman army also had similar medical teams. However, he hadn’t expected Maximus to have the women take care of the wounded soldiers. The effectiveness of their arguments had been evident during the defense just now, causing Spartacus, who hadn’t paid much attention to the harassment of women in the uprising, to now attach great importance to it. He breathed a sigh of relief at the verdict and instinctively glanced at Maximus on the side. This young man, once considered a traitor, always managed to surprise him! The outcome of the Soldier’s Assembly made the women of the logistics team cheer and rejoice. They knew that everything would be different from now on!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    ………………………………………….\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Under the initiative of the consuls, the Roman Senate convened a meeting. Over 500 senators took their seats in their designated positions. This year’s two Consuls stood in the center of the assembly hall, with seven Praetors seated behind them (it should have been eight, but Glaber was absent).\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Consul Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus was the military leader under the dictator Sulla and the younger brother of Lucius Licinius Lucullus, who served as consul the previous year. After his term as consul ended, Lucius Licinius Lucullus went to Asia Minor to serve as the governor of the province. Even though he was not in Rome, Varro Lucullus was still elected as this year’s consul. This clearly showed Lucius Licinius Lucullus’ influence within the Sulla’s faction.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    However, even though Varro Lucullus relied on his brother to ascend to power, he himself had fought in Asia Minor for many years and had achieved considerable military merits. His abilities were not weak, and many senators accepted his election.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Standing tall, Varro Lucullus surveyed the assembly hall and spoke in a solemn voice, “I have just received a report that the army led by Glaber suffered a disastrous defeat at Vesuvius. He himself perished, and more than half of the soldiers were killed or injured. The suppression of those gladiators has failed. Therefore, I propose the formation of another army to swiftly crush those rebellious slaves!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Upon hearing the news of the Roman army’s disastrous defeat, a small commotion arose from the back of the assembly hall. After all, the Campania region was close to Rome, with pleasant weather and fertile land. Many senators owned farms and villas there, so they were constantly aware of the situation and had already received the news.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The other consul, Gaius Cassius Longinus, seemed to have coordinated with Varro in advance. He immediately responded, “I agree with Varro’s proposal. We must dispatch an army as soon as possible to suppress the rebellion and restore peace in Campania!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the two consuls expressed their opinions one after another, everyone’s gaze turned to an elderly man sitting in the first seat of the front row of the Senate.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Quintus Lutatius Catulus, a former Roman consul and the most powerful ally of the dictator Sulla in the political arena was known for his integrity in Rome. When Sulla appointed him to rebuild the Temple of Jupiter, which had been burned down during the civil war, Catulus constructed it magnificently. Sulla hoped to have his name engraved on the entablature of the temple, but Catulus, considering the terror Sulla had brought to Rome, had reservations. If he agreed, it would undoubtedly ruin the perfection of the temple, causing unease for anyone who came to worship. So, he firmly refused the immensely powerful Sulla at the time and boldly inscribed his own name instead. Sulla was furious but ultimately couldn’t do anything about it. This incident earned him praise from the Roman people.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Now, Catulus was a highly respected Princeps Senatus (leader of the senate). He lightly grasped the purple-bordered toga and calmly stood up. Despite his old age, his voice was clear and sonorous. “I believe everyone present agrees to send troops to quell the rebellion. However, how many soldiers should be dispatched? Who should command them? These are the issues we need to seriously discuss. Glaber was prudent and had military capabilities, yet he suffered a defeat and died. Shouldn’t we take this group of insurgents seriously?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as he finished speaking, another elderly man by his side also rose and spoke loudly, “Based on the information I have gathered, Glaber was a fool! He had already defeated those slaves with his army. If he had continued to pursue them, victory would have been within reach. However, he was overly cautious, wanting to trap the fleeing rebels on the mountain without strengthening the camp’s defenses. As a result, the slaves launched a successful surprise attack… So, it’s not that those gladiators are formidable, but rather Glaber was foolish enough! I believe that as long as we send a competent commander, we will only need to dispatch 3,000 soldiers, just like before.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The opinion of the Princeps Senatus was directly challenged, and the other senators were not surprised because the speaker was Publius Cornelius Cethegus, another influential Roman senator in the Senate. He felt quite dissatisfied with Catulus becoming the Princeps Senatus and believed he was more qualified. Therefore, the two had been at odds in the Senate for the past two years.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many senators deep down agreed with Cethegus’ opinion. Although the Roman army suffered a disastrous defeat, they didn’t consider the rebels’ military strength to be a significant threat. They believed it was Glaber’s foolishness that led to the defeat. However, the rebellion in Campania had been ongoing for over two months, causing progressive damage to the entire southern region. It was now at the risk of spiraling out of control. Therefore, they concluded that increasing the military force was the best way to thoroughly suppress the rebellion and restore order in Campania.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After discussions, the senators reached a unanimous decision: to form a legion.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The majority still believed that there was no need for a consul to personally lead the campaign against a group of lowly gladiators and slaves. Therefore, the choice of commander should still come from the praetors, as it had been in the previous campaign.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Unlike the last time, where almost no praetors were willing to go on the expedition, this time, most praetors voluntarily expressed their willingness to assume command. Conquering a group of lowly gladiators wouldn’t bring glory, but since the rebels had defeated the Roman army and slaughtered Roman soldiers before, crushing them to win the applause of the people would be a good choice.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In the end, the majority of senators chose Praetor Publius Varinius. Compared to other praetors, his experience of fighting alongside Sulla in Asia Minor was a significant factor that favored him among the senators.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As the meeting concluded, the senators began to leave one by one.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Crassus! Crassus! Wait for me!” After leaving the Senate, a middle-aged man hurriedly shouted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Accompanied by his call, one of the senators who was descending the steps halted and turned around.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    This man had a tall stature, a square face, a broad forehead, a high nose bridge, thick eyebrows, and big eyes. His gaze was sharp, and somewhat intimidating, but the smile on his face added a touch of affability.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    He was Praetor Marcus Licinius Crassus, the wealthiest man in Rome.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    When he saw the person calling out to him, his smile grew wider. “Sulla, why are you shouting so urgently? Is there something you need?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Publius Cornelius Sulla was the nephew of the dictator Sulla. During Sulla’s occupation of Rome and the purge of his political enemies, this man had closely cooperated with Crassus and gained a substantial amount of wealth. Therefore, their relationship was quite close.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Young Sulla hurriedly approached Crassus, grabbing his arm and speaking in a low voice. “Inside just now, why didn’t you volunteer like the others to lead the army? This is a great opportunity to win glory! In terms of military capabilities, Varinius can’t compare to you.”\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n", "Chapter 49": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <div id=\"chapter_content\">\n   <div class=\"sp-title\">\n    <h1 class=\"text-center mt-5\">\n     Chapter 49 – Military Training (Part I)\n    </h1>\n   </div>\n   <p>\n    Crassus smiled slightly and said, “Sulla, you should know that when you want to buy a house, it’s best not to buy it when the price is still high. Wait until the price hits rock bottom, so you’ll make more profit.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Young Sulla widened his eyes and asked, “Do you… do you think Varinius will fail?!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “No one can say for certain who will win or lose in war,” Crassus turned his head to look at Varinius, who was excitedly talking to several other senators near the entrance of the Senate. He said casually, “But in business, sometimes you have to take risks. Besides, even if I misjudge, it won’t cause me much loss.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Young Sulla shrugged and said, “You’re right. It’s a waste of time to defeat a group of slaves that not many people care about. It’s better to use that time to make more money.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Changing the topic, he continued, “Have you heard? The war in Iberia is going well recently. Pompey has already captured several strongholds of the rebels. That Sertorius isn’t as rampant as before.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Crassus’ face changed for a moment, but he quickly regained his composure and sneered, “The Senate has given Pompey such great support, and he commands nearly 100,000 troops. Yet, it’s taking him so long to deal with remnants of the populares. What’s there to be happy about?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After speaking, he continued walking, but he felt a sense of urgency in his heart.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Young Sulla deliberately lagged two steps behind, and a smirk formed on his lips. He thought, “Hehe, Crassus, no matter how wealthy you are, there are still things that don’t go your way. However, to have the place where you started up become the territory for others to cultivate supporters and train their armies, anyone’s heart would feel uneasy about that!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    …………………………………………\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Before you stand your enemies. They have not only taken away your land and turned you into slaves, but now they also want to take your lives! You must tightly grip your swords, kill them, and seek revenge for yourselves. Do you understand?!” Frontinus shouted loudly.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Understood!!” The fully armed guards responded in unison, holding wooden shields and wooden clubs in their hands as they attacked the wooden stakes set up in front of them.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Try to strike the exposed parts of the enemy’s skin with your swords—hands and feet. Even a small wound that causes pain and bleeding will weaken their strength and morale, giving you an advantage… Always remember, when you swing your short swords, your long shields in your hands must protect you firmly. Otherwise, before you strike the enemy, you’ll be knocked down by them…”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The guards listened attentively to Frontinus’ teachings. The wooden clubs and shields they held were crudely made, but slightly heavier than real swords and shields. They practiced thrusting, stabbing, feints, and charges on the wooden stakes. Behind them, members of the military advisory group patrolled back and forth, occasionally correcting their striking movements. If they noticed any soldiers slacking off, they would immediately reprimand them and impose additional training time as punishment. As a result, no one dared to slack off.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Watching the soldiers drenched in sweat one by one, Frontinus showed a hint of a satisfied smile on his face. Throughout his decades-long military career, he had trained numerous new recruits, and the training attitude of these soldiers before him was undoubtedly the best.\n    <em>\n     Not surprising, really, as slaves are always the ones most able to endure hardship and toil.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frontinus’s gaze fell on Maximus, who was also undergoing rigorous training. On the first day of military training, this young leader of the logistics camp (due to the expansion of the logistics team, Maximus had changed its name to the logistics camp) had requested to participate in training like ordinary soldiers. Initially, Frontinus had some hesitation, fearing that Maximus would do something unexpected and disrupt the training atmosphere.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    But in fact, during these three days of training, Maximus always listened attentively to his commands and meticulously fulfilled the training requirements he set forth. His leading by example also influenced the other soldiers, especially the leader of the guard team, Phaselus, ensuring that every one of Frontinus’ orders could be executed smoothly, which saved him a lot of worry.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Frontinus was grateful for this because he understood that Maximus was helping him establish authority. In reality, Maximus didn’t need to do the wooden stake striking training anymore since he was a gladiator, and it was already part of their basic skills.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Time’s up, wooden stake training is over!” Frontinus exclaimed loudly. “Everyone, assemble in formation!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As soon as his words fell, the soldiers stopped their training, holding wooden sticks and shields, and gathered together, panting heavily. They formed two columns in formation, with Maximus and Phaselus standing at the front. This simple formation was full of errors at the beginning, but after repeated training, they achieved the current result.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “March around the camp at a normal pace,” Frontinus said and took the lead.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Maximus and Phaselus exchanged a glance and led the formation closely behind.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Since the rebels had seized the supplies of the Roman army, there was now an ample stock of provisions. Therefore, in recent days, they hadn’t dispatched troops for plundering but instead focused on military training. The various cohorts were scattered around the camp, and trees and crops that hindered training had been cleared, creating an environment filled with dust and bustling voices.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Whenever the guards passed by, it would attract some curious gazes. “Is it necessary for the small guard team to come out to train?”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “They just need to keep an eye on those women. They shouldn’t get involved in the fighting—that’s our job to protect them.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Hey, don’t talk nonsense. They might complain about us later. When we get injured, the women in the medical team might refuse to treat us!”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Yeah, you’re right.”\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldiers of the guard team heard this, and although they felt indignant, no one retorted or argued, because this was an armed march after intense training. The entire unit had to march in orderly formation, and although the pace was not fast, if they expended effort arguing instead of using this opportunity to recover their strength, once they lost their rhythm and fell out of formation, they would be punished with double training sessions by Frontinus. So everyone, including Maximus and Phaselus, marched forward in silence, and by the time they returned to the original training ground, the soreness in their arms had mostly subsided.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    “Shield collision training begins!” Frontinus commanded, and the guards formed pairs, each holding a wooden shield and colliding with each other. The one forced to retreat would be considered the loser, and after three consecutive losses, they would face punishment. The winning side would gain valuable resting time, so everyone gave it their all.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Both the wooden stake training and shield collision training were designed to cultivate the individual combat capabilities of soldiers in formation battles. Training with weighted wooden shields and clubs for an extended period would make the soldiers stronger and more powerful, enabling them to wield real swords and shields more freely and thus boosting their confidence.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After the shield collision training, it was another armed march around the camp. This not only laid the foundation for future long-distance marching training for the guards but also taught them to relax during marches because the next training session would involve more intense agility exercises.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Originally, in Frontinus’ initial training plan, the third individual training was spear-throwing. However, considering the current situation with the rebels, it was unlikely that there would be sufficient supplies of heavy spears for the various cohorts for a long time, let alone the logistics camp’s guards. So that part was temporarily skipped.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The third individual training was agility training, which was important for heavily armored soldiers who needed to climb ladders and overcome obstacles while fully armed.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The military advisory group set up two wooden stakes supporting a wooden beam in the training ground, reaching the height of an adult’s knee. The soldiers were required to hurdle over it while running, which seemed easy, but it was not so simple when wearing a helmet and breastplate. Even if they managed to cross, due to the inability to maintain balance, they would fall to the ground, and any protrusions or irregularities inside the armor would leave bruises of the same shape on their bodies. In the past few days since the training began, almost all soldiers, except Maximus and Phaselus, had numerous bruises on their bodies.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The soldiers who had started to adapt to this training didn’t fall this time, but they had no time to rejoice. The military advisory group added several more wooden beams on the training ground and demanded that they continuously cross them while running without stopping.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n"}
