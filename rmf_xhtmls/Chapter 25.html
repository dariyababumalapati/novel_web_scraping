     Chapter 25 – Before the Battle
    </h1>
   </div>
   <p>
    Maximus hurriedly approached Hamilcar’s side. Hamilcar glanced at him, then looked ahead and said, “The Romans are here.” Despite Hamilcar’s efforts to appear calm, Maximus could still hear the tension in his voice.
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximus looked into the distance and saw Roman cavalry in groups of ten, advancing in a fan-shaped formation towards the vineyard. In the far distance, a long line of soldiers was approaching. Two standard-bearers led the way, draped in wolf skins and holding eagle emblems and flags. Behind them were several trumpeters carrying long horns, followed by Roman legionnaires. They marched in five parallel columns, each wearing a red waistcoat, a Gallic-style helmet, and segmented armor, and carrying a large red shield in their left hand and a heavy javelin in their right. They had a short Roman sword on their left side and a short dagger on their right… They walked with their heads held high, exuding an imposing aura. This was not just a simple march, but a force ready for battle. At the end of the long line, there were several auxiliary soldiers wearing leather helmets and chainmail, armed with long spears and large shields. Even the equipment of these less valued Roman auxiliaries far surpassed that of the majority of rebel soldiers. The whole formation was followed by a dozen or so wagons and some army slaves.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Roman army, with their shining helmets and bright armor, sparkled in the sunlight, emitting a dazzling light…
   </p>
   <p>
    Hamilcar and Maximus squinted their eyes, holding their breath, and stood still, observing for quite a while.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hamilcar exclaimed angrily, “There are more than just 2,000 or 3,000 men. It has already exceeded 4,000!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “About 4,300,” Maximus said with certainty.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I must quickly inform Spartacus!” Hamilcar turned and ran towards the camp.
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximus remained standing, continuing to observe the advancing Roman army. They were not moving at a fast pace. It took about half an hour for them to approach the olive oil farm, which was about 1.5 kilometers away. By this time, the rebel forces had roughly completed their formation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Spartacus, Crixus, and several other leaders also arrived near Maximus to observe the enemy.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hamilcar pulled Maximus aside and whispered in his ear, “As the leader of the Logistics Team, you should stay with your subordinates at a time like this instead of wandering around here!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximus was alert, realizing that he had been too curious about the Roman legion and had momentarily forgotten his duty. He quickly apologized and humbly asked for advice, “Teacher, I was wrong! What should I do now?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Hamilcar looked serious and said, “The Logistics Team consists mainly of women, elderly, and children. You should gather them together and comfort them! And…”
   </p>
   <p>
    He lowered his voice and said, “You need to prepare the wagons and load them with some food, just in case——”
   </p>
   <p>
    Hamilcar didn’t continue, but Maximus understood his meaning. He nodded solemnly and turned around to run back.
   </p>
   <p>
    The rebel formation was right behind him, with the majority of the front row consisting of gladiators, all fully armed. Maximus heard several people calling his name, but he didn’t have time to respond.
   </p>
   <p>
    As Maximus hurried back to the farm, the Roman army, passing by the olive oil farm, had already stopped their advance. They faced the rebel forces and began to prepare for formation.
   </p>
   <p>
    From the hill, Spartacus looked down at the scene and said with a serious expression, “The Romans are preparing to attack!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Our brothers are ready and waiting for them to come and die!” Oenomaus enthusiastically declared.
   </p>
   <p>
    The gladiators behind him took the opportunity to roar, rallying the other rebel soldiers. “HRAAAH!! HRAAAH!!” The morale of the rebel forces soared.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Roman army remained unfazed, calmly forming their ranks. They had been marching in an organized formation, with their entire force moving horizontally. Each large unit gradually gathered, forming the traditional Roman checkerboard formation. Their formation speed was much faster than that of the rebel army. However, strangely enough, the auxiliary soldiers at the rear of their formation broke away and dropped their weapons. They walked toward the wagons parked behind the formation and took out shovels, hoes, and other digging tools stored inside. They surrounded the olive oil farm and started digging.
   </p>
   <p>
    This peculiar action puzzled Spartacus and the others: The auxiliary soldiers in this Roman army numbered over a thousand, accounting for more than a quarter of the entire force. Instead of participating in the battle, they were digging. What were they up to?
   </p>
   <p>
    After a while, the Roman legion completed its formation but remained stationary. Meanwhile, the sweating auxiliary soldiers had already dug a shallow trench, encircling the olive oil farm. The soil they excavated was used to build earthworks inside the trench.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hamilcar suddenly realized, “The Romans are constructing a camp!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Will they still attack us?” Artorix immediately asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The Roman army has a habit of building temporary camps on the battlefield. This way, if they are defeated, they can take refuge inside and defend themselves to ensure their safety. I never expected them to be so cautious even when facing us. Perhaps once they finish building, they will launch an attack against us.” Spartacus said, recalling his experience fighting with the Roman army in Asia Minor and having some understanding of their tactics.
   </p>
   <p>
    “So, how long do we have to wait? Why not take the initiative and attack them now while the Romans have fewer troops?” Oenomaus impatiently suggested.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Since we have already formulated a battle plan in advance, we should execute it according to the plan!” Spartacus said in a deep voice.
   </p>
   <p>
    Even Crixus, who usually boasted of his bravery, agreed with Spartacus’ opinion at this moment. Seeing the well-organized Roman army below the hill, he felt a bit intimidated.
   </p>
   <p>
    As a result, the rebel army continued to wait silently on the slope, while the Roman legion remained motionless below, with only the Roman auxiliary soldiers toiling away.
   </p>
   <p>
    As time passed, the clamor within the rebel army grew louder. The once dense formation gradually became sparse. The soldiers chatted and joked to alleviate the tension. Some even sat down on the ground due to the scorching sun and prolonged standing. Spartacus and his comrades had to hurry to their respective units, doing their best to inspire the soldiers and maintain their dwindling morale.
   </p>
   <p>
    Similar circumstances occurred within the Roman army, but the veteran officers performed more efficiently, resulting in the soldiers displaying better discipline.
   </p>
   <p>
    Both sides stood facing each other, several miles apart, until noon. By then, the trench behind the Roman army had been mostly dug, and the earthen wall had been erected, complete with designated entrances and exits. Roman commander Glaber gave the order, and the Roman soldiers began withdrawing one by one into the earthen wall and the olive oil farm.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Roman army didn’t launch the attack Spartacus had anticipated, which disappointed him. However, when he saw the rebel soldiers lying and resting on the ground behind him, he couldn’t help but feel relieved.
   </p>
   <p>
    Although no battle took place that day, the Roman army had come dangerously close. This made the rebel forces nervous, prompting Spartacus and his comrades to hold another urgent meeting. After discussing, they decided to temporarily continue with their original plan and wait for the Romans to attack. But at the same time, they would strengthen the camp’s defenses to prevent enemy sneak attacks.
   </p>
   <p>
    On the Roman side, Glaber also feared a sneak attack from the rebels. He ordered the auxiliary soldiers to continue setting traps and constructing palisades outside the trench. He also arranged multiple patrols within the camp to keep watch throughout the night.
   </p>
   <p>
    Although it was an uneventful day, many people didn’t sleep well, including Maximus. After all, whether in his past life or the present one, it was his first experience of war.
   </p>
   <p>
    But as the rooster crowed at dawn, Maximus immediately got up and headed to the kitchen.
   </p>
   <p>
    Without any need for his urging, Agnes had already led her team to busy themselves because they were well aware that if the rebel army suffered a defeat, they could face dire consequences. The only thing they could do was to quickly prepare delicious food, ensuring the soldiers ate their fill and had abundant strength to fight the enemy.
