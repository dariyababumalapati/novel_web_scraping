     Chapter 24 – The Roman Legion Is Coming
    </h1>

   <p>
    Maximus blinked his eyes. “Can you read?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I can read a little.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do you know arithmetic?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I know a little.”
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     To be able to manage a farm, it’s not just about knowing how to read and do arithmetic!
    </em>
    Maximus looked at the hardworking Vorenus and realized that he was a rare talent in the Logistics Team. If he were to replace Cornelius and manage the warehouse, it would be a waste of talent. After thinking for a moment, Maximus said, “Vorenus, starting today, you don’t need to go to the kitchen anymore. Stay by my side and help me handle the affairs of the entire Logistics Team.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Huh?” Vorenus raised his head in surprise.
   </p>
   <p>
    Just as Maximus was about to speak, someone barged into the room. “C-Captain, Commander Spartacus has asked for you to attend a meeting!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximus saw that it was Pigres who came in and asked in astonishment, “Why did you come back so early?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “The… the Roman army is coming!” Pigres gasped for breath.
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximus was taken aback.
   </p>
   <p>
    Vorenus’ hand trembled, and the papyrus he was holding fell to the ground.
   </p>
   <p>
    ………………………………………………………
   </p>
   <p>
    “Omarkel’s men have discovered the Roman army and saw them entering Naples. There is no doubt that they are coming for us. So, as soon as I received the news, I immediately returned with the First Team.” Spartacus explained the situation to everyone.
   </p>
   <p>
    “How many Roman soldiers are there?” Crixus asked anxiously.
   </p>
   <p>
    “There are about 2,000 to 3,000 men. They are fully armed, holding the eagle standard high, and they also have hundreds of cavalry.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Is it 2,000 or 3,000 soldiers? Can you be more specific?!” Hamilcar asked impatiently.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Hamilcar, not everyone has a talent for arithmetic like you. Omarkel’s men were loyal to their duty and dared to extend their reconnaissance beyond the Vesuvius region. They discovered the trace of the Roman army in a timely manner and made a rough estimate of their numbers. That’s already quite good!” Spartacus defended the cavalry.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I understand that, but the difference between 2,000 and 3,000 is a thousand men, and that can significantly affect our tactical planning.” Hamilcar was getting anxious.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Regardless of how many of them come, as long as the Romans dare to show up here, we’ll charge at them and crush them all, just like we did at the Temple of Flora!” Oenomaus fiercely said.
   </p>
   <p>
    “According to what Spartacus said, this army that has come should be a Roman legion, far superior to the Capuan city guards. They are well-equipped and even have cavalry. As for us, we have less than five hundred people with actual weapons, while the rest either have sticks or farming tools. How can we face off against a Roman legion?” Artorix’s face revealed concern.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Sticks can kill people just like any weapon. Furthermore, we have many more people than them. When the time comes, we’ll charge together and surround the Romans. Even if they have powerful weapons, they won’t be able to unleash their full force. In the end, they will only be killed by us, just like when we escaped from the gladiator school!” Crixus said confidently.
   </p>
   <p>
    “For gladiators like you and me who have undergone long-term training, using sticks to kill people is indeed easy. However, most of our men are used to handling hoes and farming tools. They haven’t received training, and they would hesitate even to kill a person. How can they have the courage to fight against the Roman army?!” Artorix reminded.
   </p>
   <p>
    “If that’s what you’re saying, then why don’t we just surrender when the Romans arrive!” Crixus mocked.
   </p>
   <p>
    “My men are not afraid of the Romans. When they arrive, I will lead the charge and show them the might of my Third Team!” Oenomaus said with a proud expression.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Enough arguing!” Spartacus looked at everyone sternly, signaling for them to quiet down. He spoke in a deep voice, “Don’t forget that our motto is ‘Resist Rome and fight for freedom’. The slaves who have joined us believe in us, and that’s why they joined our ranks. So, this battle is unavoidable, and we have prepared for it, haven’t we? However, what Artorix said does need our attention. The Roman army is coming too quickly, and our troops lack training and don’t have enough weapons. If we engage them head-on, we will certainly be at a disadvantage. My suggestion is——”
   </p>
   <p>
    Spartacus paused for a moment, pondering before continuing, “…we will first wait quietly for the Romans to attack, then position our entire army with our back against the camp and the mountain. The camp is now the home of our brothers, and they will surely fight bravely to defend it. This way, we can also prevent the Roman cavalry from flanking us and undermining the morale of our brothers.
   </p>
   <p>
    “We will defend from a high position while the Romans have to attack from below. Even if the slope is not very steep, they are wearing heavy armor and have to climb, prevent themselves from falling, and engage in battle. They won’t be able to fully utilize their attacking capabilities, and they will easily tire. As long as we withstand their initial attack, we will gain the advantage!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Spartacus’ words rejuvenated everyone’s spirits.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But the Romans are not fools. If they see us adopting this formation, they probably won’t rashly attack,” Artorix objected.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You don’t have to worry about that. Even if they see us forming up with our backs against the mountain, the Romans will definitely attack,” Hamilcar explained. “I’ve served in the Roman army before and have some understanding of them. The Romans are currently the rulers of the Mediterranean, and to them, we are nothing more than lowly slaves. If this Roman army faces us, who have no armor and lack weapons, and they still don’t dare to attack, they will only be ridiculed by other Romans.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “What Spartacus said makes sense. Let’s do it!” Crixus expressed his agreement loudly, and no one raised any objections.
   </p>
   <p>
    So Spartacus continued, “Before the Roman army attacks, our forces must not descend from the mountain to prevent being ambushed by the Romans. We need to use our time wisely to train our brothers, at least to teach them how to form formations and understand the commands for attack. Omarkel’s reconnaissance team should constantly monitor the movements of the Roman army and report back to the camp.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Maximus,” Hamilcar then said, “starting from today until we fight against the Romans, I want you to increase the amount of meat in the rations for the soldiers, so they can eat their fill at every meal. That way, they will have enough energy for training and battle.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Understood, I will make sure Agnes and the others work hard on it,” Maximus immediately responded.
   </p>
   <p>
    “That’s it then. Everyone, go back and train your troops as soon as possible,” Spartacus concluded the meeting decisively.
   </p>
   <p>
    As the people left the hall, Maximus was the last to leave. Throughout the entire meeting, he had not voiced any opinions, but he had been pondering one question: What should he do in the first battle between Spartacus’ rebel army and the Roman army?
   </p>
   <p>
    In his past life, there were only a few sparse historical records about the Spartacus rebellion, but it had inspired numerous novels and movies, each with different plots. However, there were a few key moments that remained consistent…
   </p>
   <p>
    Subconsciously, Maximus looked through the window of the hall and gazed at the mountain behind.
   </p>
   <p>
    ……………………………………………………
   </p>
   <p>
    For two consecutive days, the rebel army intensified their training in preparation for the upcoming battle. However, the Roman army remained unseen, and Omarkel’s reconnaissance team had not received any information. Once they entered the vicinity of Naples, they would be intercepted by Roman cavalry. Some Roman cavalry even roamed near the vineyard at the foot of the mountain.
   </p>
   <p>
    On the morning of the third day, while Maximus was in the bedroom asking Vorenus how to herd sheep and grow fodder, he suddenly heard the long blaring sound of a horn.
   </p>
   <p>
    Wooo!
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     The Romans are here?!
    </em>
    Maximus immediately stood up and rushed out of the bedroom and out of the farm.
   </p>
   <p>
    The camp outside was already in a frenzy, and under the shouting of the squad leaders, the soldiers noisily began to gather…
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximus sprinted through the camp and saw Hamilcar standing on a large boulder on the hillside, looking westward.
