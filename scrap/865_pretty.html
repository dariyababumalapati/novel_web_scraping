   Chapter 865 Attack on Lola
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At dusk, the Dionysian coalition dug trenches, cleared weeds and trees in the camp area, and initially built earthen ramparts... The entire coalition camp presented an arc-shaped oval, The Potentian army and Abenirum army camps at both ends are further to the north, while the Dionian army camp is to the southwest, because the series of hills to the east is not completely continuous, it has some low hills. , Alexis considered giving more support to the weaker Abenirum people, so he extended the camp to the break of the east hill (located behind the Abenirum camp) to avoid Because the hills cut off the connection between the Abenirum camp and the main force, it may become the focus of the enemy's assault.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At this time, the main force of the Samnite coalition was only able to reach Cavutim due to the bloated team (carrying many captive slaves and property) and the harassment of the Campanian army.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   At night, Lesguk carefully planned a night attack on the Dionian coalition camp, with the main target being the Potentians.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Although the cautious Alexis had warned Pollet in advance, the Beneventum people's night attack still caused some confusion to the inexperienced Potentian warriors.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After receiving the news, Alexis immediately sent reinforcements.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Because of his own lack of troops, Lesguk was unable to further expand some of the advantages he had gained. Before the enemy's reinforcements arrived, he asked the soldiers to burn some tents and then quickly retreated.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the same day, Zantiparis led half of the reserve legion, set out from the port of Enona, took a fleet, and circumnavigated the Sorrento Peninsula without any hindrance. They landed on the coast near Pompeii, and then successfully recovered Pompeii, which had been looted.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Then, he sent troops to easily recover the city of Oplontis, which was not far from Pompeii and was also deserted.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After lunch, Zantiparis left 200 soldiers to garrison in each of the two cities, and then led 3,600 soldiers to march eastward and enter the territory of Naconia, accompanied by some Baparia town residents and priests. (The residents of this town that was burned by Segovani have had close contact with the Naconians for many years, and many people can speak Samnite.) They began to shout "For Quinduk" in Samnite. Slogans such as "Revenge, drive out the Cavutim people, and give me a free Nakonia..." resonated with the original Nakonian tribesmen.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Especially when they saw that there were priests of Hades and residents of Bapalia they were familiar with in the team, they immediately became fond of this team. Therefore, Zantiparis's army was supported and welcomed by many people in Nakonia. People kept joining the team on the road.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After Segovani slew Quinduc and occupied the Naconian territory, he was busy cooperating with other tribes and attacking the Campania Alliance, and only massacred some Naconian people who fanatically believed in Hades. , forced the tribes to surrender, and asked them to send almost all the young and middle-aged people to drive them to attack the Campania League, while leaving 500 warriors from Cautim to garrison the city of Naconia.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   As for the subsequent forced relocation of several large tribes in Naconia to other areas, and then the relocation of several tribes from Kautim to Naconia to occupy the vacant land... and many more to completely control Naconi The measures in this area of ​​Asia have not yet been implemented due to the rush of time, but the tribes of Nakonia have already felt the crisis of survival, especially the brutal behavior of the Cavutim warriors in the city, which is giving birth to Naconia every day. The anger in the hearts of the people of Konya.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   When the Cavutim warriors stood at the head of the city, shocked by the huge army of enemies below the city (half of them were people from various tribes in Naconia), Zantiparis placed them at the back of the queue, so the city The soldiers could not see clearly), while the people in the city were rejoiced at the arrival of reinforcements and began to take action.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   They took advantage of the fact that the Cavutim warriors went to the city to defend themselves and burned the temporary camp of the Cavutim warriors in the city.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Seeing the fire burning in the camp, the Cavutim warriors were even more panicked. How could they not know that the city of Naconia had become as dangerous as outside the city, and their home in Cavutim had no determination in the first place. They wanted to defend this town that had nothing to do with them, so when they saw that the situation was not good, they immediately went down to the city and tried to escape through the east gate where there were no enemies outside the city.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Unexpectedly, javelins were fired from the houses on both sides of the street from time to time, killing and injuring the fleeing warriors. On the street ahead, the people in the city blocked the road with wood, mud bricks, and stones, which caused chaos to the fleeing team.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   After the Cavutim warriors left the city, the people in the city quickly opened the unguarded west gate. Zantiparis led the soldiers to rush in. Under the leadership of the people in the city, they launched a pursuit of the enemy. .
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The Cavutim warriors were defeated. Except for a few who escaped from the city, most of the warriors were either killed in battle or captured.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Since the leaders of the various tribes in Naconia were under Segovani's control, the Naconian people who had escaped Segovani's control quickly elected several highly respected elders from each tribe to cooperate with the Dionian army. Have discussions.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Zantiparis also took the initiative to withdraw his army from the city of Naconia to show his sincerity.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Soon, the two sides reached a simple agreement: the Dionysian army will make every effort to ensure the security of the Nakonian territory, but they are not allowed to send troops to the city of Nakonia; the Nakonian tribes allow Dionysian transport The baggage team passed through the territory, headed to Abenirum, and tried its best to provide help; Dionia will send Hades priests to Naconia as soon as possible to preside over sacred affairs, and repair the Hades temple as soon as possible; Onia will do its best to help the Naconian warriors coerced by Segovani return home. Naconia will also send people to follow the Dionian army to persuade the Naconian warriors to escape...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The agreement is reached, Zantiparis breathed a sigh of relief, because two items in this agreement are very important to the Dionian coalition that is fighting at the moment: one is the issue of food transportation, because if the food is transported by sea to Poseidon Asia, and then transported through rugged mountain roads to Copsa, then through mountain roads to Abenirum, and finally transported to the current Dionian coalition camp in Beneventum, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive; If you go to Pompeii by sea, then pass through the territory of Naconia, and reach Abernirum through the mountain road (there are continuous kilometers of mountains between Naconia and Abernirum, and there are only a few roads between the two places). The narrow mountain roads are connected, but the distance is not too far, which also eliminates the possibility of the Samnite coalition forces to cross the mountains and intercept the grain route). This saves almost half of the entire journey, so when Kopsa broke up, Alek The Sith and Xantiparis had already discussed a plan, and recovering Naconia was the top priority.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The other is to enter into a friendly agreement with the Naconians. With their help, it is natural to prompt the Naconian warriors in the Samnite coalition to escape from their army and weaken their strength.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But what Zantiparis did not expect was that the Naconians would proactively propose to welcome back the Hades priests. Perhaps it was because Segovani was persecuting Hades believers in the Naconian territory. It inspired the rebellious psychology of the people of Naconia, and in this chaotic time, the arrival of the priests of Hades can help the people of Naconia in many aspects such as treatment, relief, comfort, etc. This is something that the priests of native gods such as Savoni cannot do.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   That night, the defeated troops fled back to Kautim, and Segovani was shocked when he learned about it.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   He expected that the army would retreat and Naconia would probably be attacked by the enemy.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   But the southernmost land of the Kautini tribe was lost so quickly. The role played by the Naconians and the hostility they showed shocked him.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the one hand, he blocked the news to avoid letting the Naconian soldiers know; on the other hand, he sent 500 additional soldiers (including those defeated troops) to Lola and Sessala in the west, hoping that these two The city could serve as a barrier to the south of Cavutim.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   To be honest, he was not worried about the Campanian army, but he was indeed a little frightened of the Dionians, although their number of soldiers was probably not large.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   ………………………………
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   The next day, the Dionysian coalition continued to build the camp.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   With the lessons learned last night, the coalition soldiers worked harder and harder, cutting down trees, building wooden fences, building sentry towers, and setting up deer villages...
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   And Lesguk gradually adapted to the enemy's troops to suppress the city and the bombardment of ballistae. For the first time, soldiers were sent out of the city to harass. The Dionian coalition forces, which also gradually gained experience, took corresponding defensive measures and forced them back after suffering a few casualties.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   In the afternoon, more than 10,000 Samnite coalition soldiers finally entered the city of Beneventum.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   On the same day, Zantiparis led 3,600 soldiers to leave the Naconian territory and march north. After two hours of marching, they approached the city of Lola.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Here, they joined 8,000 Campania allies from the west, bringing the total strength to 11,600.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   There were only 1,500 Cavutini warriors in Lola City. Of course they felt very nervous, so they closed the four gates tightly, mobilized the whole city, and all the warriors went to the top of the city to prepare for defense.
  </font>
 </font>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Things are changing. Two days ago, the allied forces of the Samnite tribe swept across the territory of the Campania Alliance. The only city of Naples left on the Campania plain was surrounded by the Samnite people. The shouts of the Samnite warriors could make countless people The fleeing people were trembling in the city of Naples.
  </font>
  <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
   Now the situation is reversed. The Campanian army joined forces with the Dionians and surrounded the famous town of Lola in Cavoutini. The soldiers were both excited and a little nervous.
