Chapter 1: I am Zhu Yunwen! I am the son of heaven of Ming dynasty!
The wind was fierce, and the rain poured down. The night was gloomy.
A bolt of lightning, like a roaring dragon, tore through the void and descended with awe-inspiring power, causing fear and trepidation in all things.
Su Changhe felt himself falling and abruptly woke up from his dream. As he tried to get up and brush off the rain from his body, intending to continue his visit to the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, he realized that he was no longer on the steps of the mausoleum. [1]Ming Xiaoling (Chinese: 明孝陵; pinyin: Míng Xiào Líng; lit. ‘Filial mausoleum of Ming’) is the mausoleum of the Hongwu Emperor, … Continue reading
“His Majesty’s awake! His majesty’s awake! Inform the imperial physician quickly! May the heavens protect us…”
A eunuch wearing a Three Mountains hat, with a white cloth wrapped around his forehead, and dressed in a blue-gray python robe, shouted in a neutral voice.
Su Changhe was instantly stunned.
His Majesty?
Could it be that he had traveled from Nanjing to Hengdian?
Which film crew is this?
Turning his head, Su Changhe saw that the hall was brightly lit. On the ceiling, there were intricately carved patterns of coiling dragons, which looked extremely lifelike.
Above the golden doors, there were two dragons playing with a pearl.
In the center, there was a square platform adorned with a golden-carved dragon throne and golden-carved dragon screens.
In front of the throne, there were objects such as Lu Duan, cranes, and incense burners.[2]Luduan (甪端 pinyin: lùduān) is a legendary Chinese auspicious creature. It looks like a deer with green coat, the tail of a horse and a … Continue reading
In front of the platform, there were four copper-bodied cloisonné incense burners, emitting a fragrant smoke as sandalwood burned.[3]Cloisonné (French: [klwazɔne]) is an ancient technique for decorating metalwork objects with colored material held in place or separated by metal strips or wire, … Continue reading
Further away, there was also a large dragon cabinet.
“The arrangement, why does it resemble the Qianqing Palace in the Ming Imperial Palace?” Su Changhe muttered to himself. He felt a slight itch on his head and reached up to touch it. A sharp pain shot through his bones, and at the same time, a wave of unfamiliar memories flooded his mind.[4]The Palace of Heavenly Purity, or Qianqing Palace (Chinese: 乾清宫; pinyin: qiánqīng … Continue reading
The owner of these memories was named Zhu Yunwen!
Zhu Yunwen?[5]The Jianwen Emperor (5 December 1377 – ?), personal name Zhu Yunwen (朱允炆), was the second Emperor of the Ming dynasty, reigned from 1398 to 1402. The era … Continue reading
Su Changhe widened his eyes, unable to comprehend how he could have Zhu Yunwen’s memories.
Time travel?
Reincarnation?
Have I died once before?
Su Changhe couldn’t make sense of it all and felt absurd.
“Your Majesty, how do you feel? Has your condition improved?”
A gentle and dignified woman dressed in white approached. After a slight bow, she knelt by the bedside and looked at him with deep concern and worry in her eyes.
Su Changhe shifted his gaze, looking at the arrangement in the room. He got off the bed and walked to the door without having time to put on his shoes. He opened the door.
A bolt of lightning split the dark night sky, and magnificent palaces flashed before his eyes in an instant.
“Your Majesty, it’s stormy outside. Please take care of your health,” Ma Enhui followed and earnestly pleaded.
Su Changhe turned around, looking at Ma Enhui, and asked with a puzzled expression, “What happened? Why am I here?”
Ma Enhui hurriedly replied, “Your Majesty, have you forgotten? Since your enthronement and assuming the governance of the country, you have always remembered Emperor Taizu and frequently visited the Xiaoling Mausoleum. This morning, while visiting the mausoleum, you accidentally slipped and injured your head.”
“The Xiaoling Mausoleum?”
Su Changhe remembered that he was touring the Xiaoling Mausoleum and had indeed taken a fall.”
Different time!
Same location, same event!
A bolt of lightning stirred up the wind and rain six hundred years ago…
Su Changhe felt that strange memory was becoming familiar. It looks like he was indeed Zhu Yunwen, the emperor of the Ming Empire!
However, in this segment of memories, Su Changhe didn’t see great talent, didn’t see a magnanimous person, instead a cowardly, timid, and cautious.
“is this true?”
As Su Changhe walked around, memories were overlapping and restructuring, and a clear distinction between an era and reality gradually emerged in his mind.
Today is the 31st year of Hongwu, June 10th!
A month ago, Hongwu Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang died.[6]The Hongwu Emperor (21 October 1328 – 24 June 1398),[5] personal name Zhu Yuanzhang (Chinese: 朱元璋; Wade–Giles: Chu Yuan-chang), courtesy … Continue reading
Because the year name cannot be changed until next year, it still cannot be called the first year of Jianwen yet, but the year of Hongwu.
The hundred-day period of observing mourning, which includes abstaining from meat and fish, refraining from ceremonial music, abstaining from marital relations, and wearing plain clothing, has just begun and hasn’t even been a month yet.
At this moment, Zhu Yunwen has just taken power.
“Of course it’s true, Your Majesty fainted at that time…”
Ma Enhui quickly explained.
“Fainted? Won’t that news spread?”
Su Changhe knew that although Zhu Yuanzhang had passed the throne to Zhu Yunwen, the coveted supreme throne would attract more than just one or two individuals.
Especially King of Yan, Zhu Di!
It was he who later claimed “to be defending the righteous cause and stabilizing the kingdom”, and drove Emperor Jianwen, Zhu Yunwen, away.
“Your Majesty, please rest assured. We have already given orders, and no one dares to speak a word.”
The eunuch beside him spoke, and the imperial physician hurried over.
Su Changhe sat there, closing his eyes slightly. He didn’t understand why fate had made him Zhu Yunwen, one of the tragic emperors of the Ming Dynasty, who only reigned for four years.
In the end, he disappeared on his own, and his wife and children all died.
Oh, there was also a two-year-old child who was imprisoned for over fifty years, and shortly after being released, he died too.
Su Changhe didn’t hear what the imperial physician was saying. The haze of history and the merging of memories made it difficult for Su Changhe to distinguish whether he was a graduate student from the future or the real Zhu Yunwen!
The brilliance of lightning illuminated the room, and in an instant, rolling thunder followed.
Farewell, Su Changhe!
Now, I am Zhu Yunwen!
I am Emperor Jianwen, the unique ruler of the Ming Empire!
Zhu Di?![7]The Yongle Emperor (2 May 1360 – 12 August 1424), personal name Zhu Di (Chinese: 朱棣; pinyin: Zhū Dì; Wade–Giles: Chu Ti), was the third Emperor of … Continue reading
What you can do, I can do too!
I will defy the heavens and achieve supreme accomplishments!
I will become the Eternal Emperor, and let the Ming Dynasty become another golden age after the Han and Tang Dynasties! I am Zhu Yunwen!
I am the Emperor Zhu Yunwen!
I am the Emperor of the Ming Empire!
Zhu Yunwen slowly opened his eyes. In his gaze, there was no longer fear and cowardice, only resolute determination and fearlessness!
“Your Majesty, Left Assistant Minister of the Ministry of War Qi Tai and Hanlin Compiler Huang Zicheng seek an audience.”
A eunuch loudly reported.
Ma Enhui was about to reprimand them. The Emperor needed rest, so why would they seek an audience on a rainy night?
However, Zhu Yunwen waved his hand to stop Ma Enhui and calmly said, “It’s fine, let them come in.”
Zhu Yunwen was eager to see these two individuals, not because they were closely related to him, but because they were incredibly foolish. They had played a part in the downfall of the Jianwen reign, and their ideas were all impractical. It was truly a difficult situation for them.
Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng entered the hall and knelt down to pay their respects, saying, “Minister Qi Tai (Huang Zicheng) pays respects to our holy and revered Emperor.”
Zhu Yunwen searched his memory. The thin face on the left with a graying beard, close to fifty years old, belonged to Huang Zicheng, while the relatively healthy figure on the right with a spirited appearance was Qi Tai.
“No need for formalities.”
Zhu Yunwen said in a deep voice.
After exchanging a few concerned words, Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng exchanged a glance, and then Qi Tai began to speak, “Your Majesty, the regional kings currently have control over large military forces. From Gansu to Liaodong, there are nine major border kings commanding a total of 210,000 soldiers. Additionally, there are 160,000 soldiers in the Southern Desert Guard.”
“Among them, the forces under the control of King Ning are the strongest. He commands 80,000 archers and 6,000 war chariots, and his personal guards, the Duoyan Three Guards, are formidable and unstoppable.”
“Although King Yan has only over 40,000 troops, they are all seasoned warriors. Moreover, King Yan loves his soldiers as if they were his own children and has shown them countless favors. The army knows only of King Yan and has little knowledge of Your Majesty. We are afraid of potential disasters.”
“We have been restless day and night, and we implore Your Majesty to make a decisive decision early on, disband the regional kings, and take control of the military under the Five Army Commander’s Office. Only then can it be governed by Your Majesty and bring peace to the land…”
Zhu Yunwen nodded repeatedly as he listened. These two old men were wasting their talents by not joining pyramid schemes…
“Where is King Yan currently?”
Zhu Yunwen didn’t directly respond to Qi Tai.
Qi Tai was taken aback for a moment and said, “He should still be in Huai’an.”
“Huai’an?”[8]Huai’an, formerly Huaiyin, is a prefecture-level city in central Jiangsu Province in Eastern China.
A smile appeared at the corner of Zhu Yunwen’s mouth.
In history, when Zhu Di heard the news of Zhu Yuanzhang’s death, he mourned day and night. However, he was blocked at Huai’an and was not allowed to enter the capital. He could only entrust Zhu Gaochi, Zhu Gaoxu, and Zhu Gaosui to mourn on his behalf.
Since I have come here, the mighty ship of the Ming Dynasty cannot run aground again.
“Summon King of Yan to the capital.”
Zhu Yunwen said gently.
These simple five words made Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng tremble, looking at Zhu Yunwen with confusion.

Chapter 2: Zhu Di’s three sons.
“Let the kings stay in their respective territories and not come to the capital.”
This is a sentence from Zhu Yuanzhang’s testament.
In simple terms, it means that after I, Zhu Yuanzhang, pass away, you sons should stay outside and not return to the capital for mourning.
After Zhu Yuanzhang’s death, Zhu Yunwen faithfully enforced this decree.
Well, there is only one exception, and that is Zhu Di.
As for the other uncles, they all cried and entered the capital.
Zhu Yunwen’s differential treatment naturally reveals his fear of Zhu Di. Although he used the testament as a command, his actions were not honorable.
In any matter, either treat everyone equally and not let anyone come, or let everyone come.
Allowing some but stopping one, what does that mean?
Isn’t it clearly bullying Zhu Di?
It’s almost like directly slapping Zhu Di in the face and telling him that if Zhu Yunwen doesn’t allow him to come, he can only wait outside.
If you don’t listen to me, you won’t succeed. What can you do?
Zhu Di, who was slapped in the face, must have felt uncomfortable. It’s understandable that he would go back, pound tables, smash chairs, throw cups, and then turn around to make weapons and buy provisions.
Regarding Zhu Yunwen’s previously foolish decisions, the current Zhu Yunwen feels helpless and sympathetic. Of course, Huang Zicheng is credited for these ideas.
“Your Majesty, summoning King Yan to the capital at this time, wouldn’t it contradict the previous decree? Changing the imperial decree overnight would damage Your Majesty’s authority…”
Huang Zicheng quickly advised.
Zhu Yunwen sighed and said, “Before the decree was issued, the other Kings had not yet arrived in the capital. Now all the other Kings are in the capital, only King Yan is missing. How will people judge? Furthermore, our dynasty advocates benevolent and filial governance. King Yan is the fourth son of the founder of the dynasty, my fourth uncle. How can he not come to the capital?”
“Your Majesty, once King Yan enters the capital, there may be turmoil.”
Qi Tai also said uneasily.
Zhu Yunwen looked at the two of them and smiled, saying, “What turmoil would there be?”
Qi Tai replied, “King Yan once led a large army to campaign in the desert and has high prestige among the troops. In addition, he has close relations with the distinguished officials of the Five Armies Commandery. If he is allowed to stay in the capital and move about freely, he may gather popular support.”
Zhu Yunwen smiled indifferently, waved his hand, and said, “Very well, we can see where the imperial nobles stand. That’s settled then, make the arrangements.”
Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng had no choice but to bow and leave.
Ma Enhui, seeing Zhu Yunwen in a good mood, accompanied him and whispered, “Today, Your Majesty seems different from before.”
Zhu Yunwen was secretly surprised and looked at Ma Enhui.
After all, she was his close confidante, and with a woman’s intuition, she could perceive the changes.
“A few days ago, His Majesty was afraid to meet King Yan, but now he has issued an edict to summon him to the capital. I don’t know how His Majesty is considering it.”
Ma Enhui continued speaking in detail.
Zhu Yunwen looked at Ma Enhui, pondering how to respond.
Ma Enhui seemed to sense something and quickly knelt down, saying, “Please forgive me, Your Majesty. I should never have meddled in state affairs.”
Zhu Yunwen, seeing a woman kneeling before him, had a collision of memories of ceremonial norms and equality in future generations in his mind. In the end, he stepped forward and helped Ma Enhui up, carefully looking at the woman before him.
It must be said that Ma Enhui’s appearance was truly outstanding.
Her peach blossom eyes and the captivating glimmer in her gaze were enchanting. Her fair skin had a rosy glow, and her slightly moving lips emanated a faint fragrance.
She was his wife.
Zhu Yunwen sighed and took Ma Enhui’s hand, sitting at the edge of the bed, saying, “You must accompany me for a hundred years!”
Ma Enhui smiled lightly, her beauty shining amidst the chaos.
Only Zhu Yunwen knew that she would die within this palace!
Four years later!
Unless he could resolve the issue with the vassal kings(藩王) , unless he could deal with Zhu Di!
He lacked military talent, but he could rely on the history in his mind and the experiences from the future.
And this would be his decisive advantage, where he would outpace Zhu Di!
Amidst the raging storm and thunderous lightning…
The headquarters of the Central Army Commandery.
Distinguished and extraordinary, Duke of Wei, Xu Huizu, with a jade-like face and a noble bearing, was not resting but rather reviewing a batch of documents. As the son of Xu Da[1]Xu Da (1332–1385), courtesy name Tiande, was a Chinese military general and politician who lived in the late Yuan dynasty and early Ming dynasty. He was a friend of … Continue reading, the first renowned general of the founding era, Xu Huizu not only inherited Xu Da’s wisdom but also his courage.
Zhu Yuanzhang held high regard for Xu Huizu and entrusted him with the command of the Central Army Headquarters. At the young age of thirty, Xu Huizu ranked as the top military official.
Putting down the documents in his hands, Xu Huizu rubbed his slightly sore eyes and let out a sigh. He murmured to himself, “It seems that His Majesty intends to make a major move.”
Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng had been advocating for the reduction of the vassal kings, and the Emperor had inquired multiple times about border defense matters, hinting at the removal of the border kings. The knife was already raised, it was just a matter of when and where it would strike.
Xu Huizu didn’t completely agree with the idea of reducing the vassal kings. Although reducing them would benefit the country’s stability and strengthen the main branch, the capital city was still located in the south, and the vast northern territory required a group of people to guard it and deter the Mongols.
“The heart of an emperor only asks for loyalty, not ability,” Xu Huizu felt somewhat powerless.
Indeed, he was the top military official, but he was far from being a trusted confidant of Zhu Yunwen. Zhu’s confidant was Li Jinglong, the Duke of Cao, the son of Li Wenzhong, the King of Qiyang. Xu Huizu knew Li Jinglong well. Apart from his striking appearance and elegant demeanor, Li Jinglong was actually a worthless person.
He lacked any strategy, yet held the position of Commander of the Left Army. But that’s what being a confidant gets you. Xu Huizu couldn’t compare to him.
As Xu Huizu looked out the window at the lightning and thunder, he felt a wave of oppression. Suddenly, someone reported, “His Majesty has issued an order to summon the King of Yan to the capital.”
Xu Huizu was taken aback and quickly inquired if the person was certain about the news. After receiving confirmation, Xu Huizu’s expression slightly changed. He didn’t know whether the Emperor’s move was a test or a banquet at Hong Gate.
“Uncle.”
A shout interrupted Xu Huizu’s contemplation. Zhu Gaochi[2]The Hongxi Emperor (16 August 1378 – 29 May 1425), personal name Zhu Gaochi (朱高熾), was the fourth Emperor of the Ming dynasty, reigned from 1424 to 1425., with a plump and simple appearance and unsteady movements, entered the hall, followed by the remarkable Zhu Gaoxu[3]Zhu Gaoxu (Chinese: 朱高煦; 30 December 1380 – 6 October 1426), the Prince of Gaoyang (高陽王, created 1395), later the Prince of Han (漢王, created 1404), was … Continue reading and Zhu Gaosui[4].Zhu Gaosui (朱高燧; 19 Jan 1383 – 5 Oct 1431), third son of Yongle Emperor.
The three of them had come to the capital to mourn, but they hadn’t even had a chance to see Zhu Yuanzhang one last time. By the time they arrived in the capital, he had already been interred in the mausoleum. But since they had come, they could only stay in the capital. If they wanted to leave, they would have to wait until the mourning period was over.
Xu Huizu looked at his nephews, the three sons of Zhu Di, with a mix of admiration and concern in his eyes.
“Young princes, why are you still not resting at such a late hour?” Xu Huizu asked kindly.
Zhu Gaochi sat down and let out a sigh. He said, “These past few days of studying have been suffocating. My brothers and I have discussed it. Tomorrow, should we go to the martial arts field and hold a horseback archery competition? It would be a good way for us to unwind and have some fun.”
Xu Huizu pondered for a moment and gladly agreed, “No problem. Tomorrow happens to be free. We can invite some distinguished officials to participate as well and make it a grand event to showcase skills and compete.”
“In that case, we thank you, Uncle,” Zhu Gaochi and the others said as they saluted and left.
Xu Huizu turned and walked to the desk, immediately writing a secret letter and arranging for a trusted subordinate to deliver it discreetly to the palace. Then he stood by the window, watching the pouring rain outside, and murmured to himself, “It’s time for me to show my loyalty as well.”

Chapter 3: Education Needs Reform, Xu Miaojin enters the Imperial academy
Zhu Yunwen received Xu Huizu’s secret document and quietly burned the secret document to ashes.
After the rain, the sky cleared.
On this day, Zhu Yunwen didn’t work, read the documents, and didn’t go on walks with a palanquin. He just walked in the palace accompanied by Ma Enhui and several eunuchs.
The Forbidden City of the Ming Dynasty in later generations can only be said to be a ruin, and it cannot show the prosperity and prosperity of the capital of the Ming Empire at all.
Ma Enhui looked at Zhu Yunwen with confusion. He rarely walked on foot in the past but today he seemed to have the intention of strolling leisurely, Ma Enhui observe him calmly.
Some palace maids seeing him from afar knelt and paid their respect, and Zhu Yunwen would take a closer look.
“Your Majesty, when the new year comes, consider selecting some talented women to enter the palace…”
Ma Enhui’s words made Zhu Yunwen stagger, and the eunuch who was on the side hurriedly stepped forward to assist him. Zhu Yunwen waved his hand instructing them to step aside.
“I—I just feel that after the rain, everything becomes fresh. Let’s talk about those things later.”
Zhu Yunwen walked into Chang’an Palace, and upon entering, he heard a burst of light laughter.
Ma Enhui looked at frowning Zhu Yunwen, thinking he was angry. After all, although the national funeral was over, it hadn’t been long, and such bold laughter seemed inappropriate.
Ma Enhui hurriedly knelt down and said, “Your Majesty, it must be Miaojin[1]Xu Miao Jin 徐妙锦 (1380-1440). She was the third daughter of Xu Da, one of the founding generals of the Ming Dynasty, and his wife Lady Jia. According to Chen Lian’s “Qinxuan … Continue reading coming to visit Wenkui…”
Before the explanation could be clarified, a group of palace maids and court officials approached and knelt down one after another.
“Brother Emperor has arrived.”
A gentle female voice sounded.
Zhu Yunwen looked up and saw a young girl dressed in a willow-green robe and apricot-yellow long skirt, gracefully approaching.
With willow-shaped eyebrows and almond-shaped eyes, she possessed unparalleled beauty.
Her watery eyes sparkled, and her demeanor exuded a cool nobility, as well as a contradictory sense of innocence and radiance.
Xu Miaojin slightly bowed, paying her respects, and looked at Zhu Yunwen, speaking directly, “What’s wrong with your head? Can’t these servants take care of you properly?”
The eunuch behind Zhu Yunwen trembled and quickly knelt down, pleading for mercy, hoping that Xu Miaojin would go easy on them.
“Miaojin?”
Zhu Yunwen frowned slightly.
Come to think of it, this is Xu Miaojin, the fourth daughter of one of the founding fathers Xu Da.
This was the first rare female in the Ming Dynasty. It is rumored that because of her, Zhu Di “actually emptied the palace and no more queen”, and did not establish another queen until his death.
At this time Xu Miaojin was only eighteen years old, and compared to Zhu Yunwen at this time, she was three years younger.
“You……”
Xu Miaojin blushed for a moment, she didn’t expect Zhu Yunwen to call her name directly.
Although the two were similar in age, and Xu Miaojin even jokingly called Zhu Yunwen “brother”, in reality, she was a generation older than him.
After all, Xu Yihua[2]Empress Renxiaowen (仁孝文皇后; 5 March 1362 – 6 August 1407), of the Xu clan, was the empress consort to the Yongle Emperor and the third empress … Continue reading, Xu Miaojin’s eldest sister, married Zhu Di, the King of Yan.
Zhu Yunwen didn’t care about this, and looked at Xu Miaojin with his serious face, and said softly: “Sister Xu, you have quite the audacity. It has only been a month since the passing of the late emperor, and here you are laughing and rejoicing without restraint. What kind of decorum is this??”
Caught off guard, Xu Miaojin forgot about the earlier incident and hastily replied, “According to the late emperor’s decree, the people of the realm mourn for three days and then resume their normal lives, including marriages. I am merely following the late emperor’s wishes. How can I be at fault?”
Zhu Yunwen was momentarily speechless. He hadn’t expected this young girl to be so sharp and skilled at using his grandfather’s authority against him.
Xu Miaojin snorted and continued, “As the emperor, you wear a gloomy expression and set an example for everyone. Who in the palace dares to be joyful? If the entire Ming Dynasty is like this, where is the vitality?”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Xu Miaojin, who was twisting his word and forcing logic. He smiled and said, “It’s not bad to be eloquent. By the way, do you want to work for me?”
Xu Miaojin widened her eyes and quickly shook her head in refusal.
In the Ming Dynasty, there were six bureaus and one department for female officials.
The six bureaus referred to Shanggong (尚宫, Palace Affairs), Shangyi (尚仪, Ceremonies), Shangfu (尚服, Wardrobe), Shangshi (尚食, Food), Shangqin (尚寝, Housekeeping), and Shanggong (尚功, Workshop). The overall management of these bureaus was handled by the Shanggong (尚宫, Palace Affairs) Supervisor.
The department was known as Yisi(一司 or “One department), which served as the disciplinary authority, responsible for regulations and punishments.
In simple terms, the role of female officials in the Ming Dynasty was to manage the affairs of the consorts and palace maidens. They served within the inner palace.
Xu Miaojin was not part of the inner palace but belonged to the Xu Family. With her noble status, it was highly unlikely for her to become a female official in the palace.
Even Ma Enhui, who was standing beside them, felt surprised by this request as it was highly inappropriate.
Zhu Yunwen, however, disregarded these constraints and said to Xu Miaojin, “I know you possess innate goodness, intelligence, and a thirst for knowledge. With the empire now at peace and me ascending the throne, it is a time to employ capable individuals. I hope that you can enter the Imperial Academy (国子监[3]The Guozijian,[1] sometimes translated as the Imperial College, Imperial Academy, Imperial University, National Academy, or National University,[2] was the … Continue reading) and assist me in selecting talented individuals. Are you willing?”
“The Imperial Academy?” Xu Miaojin was even more astonished.
Ma Enhui quickly said, “Your Majesty, the Imperial Academy is a place for the Emperor’s disciples, a crucial institution of the state. Miaojin is still young and her knowledge is limited. Moreover, she is a woman. How can she be sent to the Imperial Academy for official duties? It would be better to summon the Chief of the Imperial Academy and have him assess their qualifications.”
Zhu Yunwen did not respond to Ma Enhui but simply looked at Xu Miaojin, a faint smile on his lips.
Xu Miaojin, feeling a bit excited, looked at Zhu Yunwen. It was an unprecedented event for a female official to enter the Imperial Academy. She bowed and said, “I am willing.”
Zhu Yunwen nodded earnestly and said, “What I desire are individuals with true talent and learning. If you handle this well, I will allow you to establish a school for women outside of the Imperial Academy.”
“What?!” Xu Miaojin exclaimed in surprise as she looked at Zhu Yunwen.
“A woman without talent is a virtue” is a true portrayal of ancient women. In Chinese history, the protagonists are always men.
Women were confined to their homes, with limited opportunities, serving as a tool of the ruling class. No one has ever cared about women’s right to education and development.
Zhu Yunwen intends to set a precedent for this!
Chairman Mao taught us that women can hold up half the sky!
Although nowadays, advocating for equality, freedom of speech, and similar ideas will draw criticism from the censors, the Ministry of Rites, and countless others, can’t we at least promote education?
Xu Miaojin knelt down slowly, looked at Zhu Yunwen solemnly, and said, “Is what Your Majesty said true?”
She was an intelligent person and understood the significance of a women’s school! If she were not Xu Da’s daughter, if she were not favored by her elder brothers, Xu Miaojin would be confined to the courtyard, reading books and playing the zither, without any other options. And for many other women, they dare not even step outside their homes.
Forget about attending school like boys, they would only learn female crafts within their homes. They were marginalized and their opinions held no weight.
The Four Books and Five Classics, the knowledge of the world? Men would say, ‘What’s the use of learning?’ Women were not allowed to hold official positions!
This sense of discontent remained in Xu Miaojin’s heart, but she never thought it could be changed.
“If you cannot achieve it and bring in talented individuals, the door to the women’s school will be forever closed under your watch!” Zhu Yunwen said solemnly.
Xu Miaojin felt the immense pressure on her shoulders, but she remained steadfast and said, “I will definitely achieve it!”
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and said, “Issue the imperial decree, appoint Xu Miaojin as the Chief of Education(学正) at the National Academy, in charge of discipline and overseeing the students.”
“As you command,” the eunuch on the side shouted.
Zhu Yunwen waved his hand, signaling Xu Miaojin to stand up, and he said to the eunuch, “Inform the Imperial Academy’s Chief Scholar(祭酒[4]TL’s note: The Highest position in Imperial Academy), Cheng Shizhou, and the Registrar(司业), Zhang Zhi, that I have made a decision on this matter. They should not cause any further trouble.”
After speaking, Zhu Yunwen walked into Chang’an Palace in a good mood and looked at the child sleeping peacefully on the bed. This was his son Zhu Wenkui, he was two years old.
Marquis Ma’enhui watched Zhu Yunwen’s face filled with happiness as he sat down beside him and sighed, “Your Majesty, today’s arrangements may bring some controversies”
Zhu Yunwen’s lips curled up slightly, and he said boldly, “These controversies are nothing. If necessary, we can have a public debate.”, “
“A debate?” Ma Enhui blinked, unsure of how Zhu Yunwen could win in debate against those learned scholars who were skilled in quoting classics.
“Your Majesty, Xu Huizu requests an audience,” a eunuch reported.
Zhu Yunwen chuckled and said, “It seems that the excitement in the training ground has ended. Let him come to the Wu Ying Hall (武英殿, Hall of Martial Valor)[5]Hall of Martial Valor was the place where emperors went on a fast and receive ministers. It is also one of the studios for the Ming dynasty court painters..”

Chapter 4: Expanding the Army? No, I Want to Reduce it by 100,000
Wu Ying Hall.
Xu Huizu entered the hall, performed a respectful salute, and respectfully said to Zhu Yunwen, “Your Majesty, Prince Gaoyang has won a golden sword.”
Prince Gaoyang, Zhu Gaoxu.
The second son of Zhu Di.
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and said, “It seems that my fourth uncle’s son is indeed formidable, inheriting the excellence of his father. However, is it not beneath your dignity to personally come to the palace just for a martial arts competition?”
Xu Huizu lowered his head, hesitated for a moment, and then knelt down, solemnly saying, “Your Majesty, I have seen the Guards of King Yan, the soldiers under the control of imperial court, completely obedient to his commands. I am filled with anxiety day and night. Furthermore, I have witnessed each King of Yan’s son have exceptional skills, especially Zhu Gaoxu, who excels in warfare.”
“I believe that when the regional Kings hold significant military power outside the capital, it becomes difficult for the imperial decrees to reach every corner of the empire, which is detrimental to the court. I earnestly implore Your Majesty to implement the policy of reducing the power of the regional kings to restore peace to the empire.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Xu Huizu with a slight frown.
It seems that the news of summoning King Yan to the capital yesterday made Xu Huizu mistakenly believe that it was an attempt to keep the King in the capital and reduce his power.
That’s why he came here in advance to request reducing the power of vassal kings(削藩).
First, it allows him to express his loyalty and clarify that “I, Xu Huizhu, am a loyal follower of your reign, Jianwen Emperor. Please trust me.”
Second, it helps to strengthen their relationship and demonstrate their stance.
After all, Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng have continuously advocated for the reduction of feudal powers. Although this matter is kept confidential, it is difficult to bypass the Five Army Command Headquarters.
“Reduce the power of the vassal kings? Haha, why should i do that?”
Zhu Yunwen stood up, looked at Xu Huizhu’s surprised face, and said, “You’re overthinking it. My uncles can still be trusted.”
Xu Huizu looked at Zhu Yunwen in disbelief, unsure if he had changed his mind or if he was distrusting him.
Understanding Xu Huizu’s thoughts, Zhu Yunwen kindly said, “The prosperity of the empire lies in the prosperity of the people and the peace of the nation. Uncles have defended the borders and made significant contributions.”
Xu Huizu was somewhat perplexed.
Zhu Yunwen explained, “Let’s set aside the matter of reducing the power of the vassal kings for now. I intend to implement a new military policy, and I wanted to hear your thoughts on it.”
“A new military policy?”
Xu Huizu looked at Zhu Yunwen and quickly responded, “As long as Your Majesty commands, I dare not disobey.”
Zhu Yunwen shook his head slightly and asked, “How many elite troops are currently in the capital garrison?”
Xu Huizu promptly reported, “There are currently 500,000 elite troops in the capital garrison, Your Majesty. If your majesty intend to expand the military, I suggest mobilizing troops from Guangdong, Guangxi, and the northwest. The soldiers there are skilled and brave, and they can be of great use!”
Xu Huizu’s idea was simple. If Zhu Yunwen did not plan to reduce the power of vassal kings, then strengthening the central government’s military power would be necessary. By having a strong military force, they could overpower any threat posed by the regional kings, weakening their influence.
Zhu Yunwen frowned slightly, surprised at the size of the current garrison of 500,000 troops. During the reign of Zhu Yuanzhang, the military development was considered, and the “Inner and Outer Garrison” system was implemented, with 48 divisions of troops. Each division consisted of 5,600 soldiers, amounting to nearly 300,000 troops at that time. However, over time, by the beginning of the Jianwen era, the size of the capital garrison had already reached 500,000 troops, and the northern vassal kings also commanded more than 300,000 troops.
“How about reducing the military by 100,000?” Zhu Yunwen asked solemnly.
Xu Huizhu quickly said, “Deploying 100,000 elite troops to defend… eh? Reducing the military?”
Xu Huizhu, who thought they would be discussing troop deployment, was suddenly taken aback.
How could they weaken their own strength without strengthening it?
How would they respond if the vassal kings showed any signs of defiance?
Zhu Yunwen was not joking; instead, he spoke with utmost seriousness: “You know better than anyone about the state of the military. What we need is not the old, weak, sick, or a bunch of servants or lackeys. Nor do we need a group of pampered soldiers. What we need is an army capable of fighting!”
The issue of corruption within the military had always been a chronic problem throughout various dynasties.
Just because you hold a spear, does that mean you’re an elite soldier? Look at your age, you’re practically buried in the yellow soil up to your neck.
Just because you have a registered name, does that make you a true soldier? Who doesn’t know that you’re the servant of some influential figure or the retainer of a military general?
A group of individuals who rarely engage in training, how dare they call themselves elite?
Xu Huizhu broke out in a cold sweat, suddenly understanding that quality mattered more than quantity when it came to the military.
“You have one month to rectify the army. After one month, I will personally inspect them! Make sure to create some noise and make it noticeable.”
Zhu Yunwen issued the order.
After leaving the Wuying Hall, Xu Huizhu returned to the Five Army Commandery’s office, still in a state of uncertainty. He summoned his two younger brothers, Xu Yingxu, the Deputy Commander[1]“佥事” was used to refer to a mid-level administrative officer who assisted in the management and governance of local affairs. of the Central Army, and Xu Zengshou, the Left Commander of the Right Army Commandery, and informed them about the plan to reduce the army by 100,000 soldiers.
Both of them were taken aback and caught off guard by the news.
Xu Huizhu calmly observed his two brothers as they processed this astonishing information and sighed, remarking, “The Emperor’s move is truly remarkable.”
Perplexed, Xu Yingxu asked, “Elder brother, what do you mean?”
Taking a sip of tea to calm his nerves, Xu Huizhu explained, “The Emperor’s actions serve three purposes. First, it is to reorganize the army. Second, it is to discipline the influential and noble generals. And third, it is to convey to the regional kings that the Emperor has no intention of interfering with them and hopes they will maintain stability in their fiefdoms.”
“Perhaps the Emperor has another layer of intention.”
Gazing at his brothers, Xu Zengshou spoke slowly, “By informing the regional kings that the Emperor is capable of taking action against the army in the capital, he is also implying that if he were to take action against the border armies under their control, it would be within reason. At that point, even if the border princes oppose, they would have no grounds to resist.”
Impressed, Xu Huizhu glanced at Xu Zengshou and agreed, “The Emperor’s intentions are hard to decipher now, but reducing the army by 100,000 is an inevitable move. However, it is a risky move that will surely offend many.”
In times of peace, the generals, nobles, powerful figures, and influential families all sought to accumulate wealth. The meager salaries established by Zhu Yuanzhang long ago would have left them starving.
For these individuals, the best way to amass wealth was through military salaries.
By reducing the army by 100,000, it was not necessarily reducing the actual number of soldiers by that amount but rather removing those who were embezzling salaries or fraudulently collecting military funds.
According to Xu Huizhu’s estimation, the actual number of soldiers to be cut would probably not exceed 50,000.
“Brother, there is another troublesome matter…”
Xu Zengshou looked at Xu Huizhu and massaged his temples.
“What is it?”
Xu Huizhu had a bad feeling about this.
Sighing, Xu Zengshou replied, “This morning, Miaojin entered the palace to accompany the empress and was appointed as Chief of Education of the Imperial Academy. The court is now in shock, and some officials are preparing to impeach…”
Xu Huizhu felt his vision darken and a sense of dizziness overwhelmed him. “What? Miao Jin? How could she enter the Imperial Academy? How could she become Chief of Education?”
The Imperial Academy was a prestigious institution, a gathering place for scholars from all over the country. Many officials had graduated from the Imperial Academy. Not to mention that these scholars were stubborn and unruly, always spouting lofty ideals of benevolence, righteousness, and the Three Fundamental Bonds and Five Constant Virtues[2]In Confucianism, the Sangang Wuchang (Chinese: 三綱五常; pinyin: Sāngāng Wǔcháng), sometimes translated as the Three Fundamental Bonds and Five Constant … Continue reading. How could they possibly accept a woman?
What kind of move was the Emperor making? Wasn’t he just asking for trouble?
The court officials were always looking for something to complain about. They were idle during the period of national mourning, so upon hearing that a woman had entered the Imperial Academy, they would surely jump at the opportunity to criticize and submit petitions.

Chapter 5: Fang Xiao Ru the Everlasting Loyal Minister
The imperial censor Gao Xiang splashed ink, citing ancient texts and references.
From the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors to the Ancestor of the Ming Dynasty, thousands of words have been scattered and filled with grief and anger. Gao Xiang said bluntly: “Women ought to stay at home and do embroidery, why should they degrade themselves to the court? We are all men of valor, and we will not disgrace the Four books and Five Classics[1]The Four Books and Five Classics (Chinese: 四書五經; pinyin: Sìshū Wǔjīng) are the authoritative books of Confucianism, written in China before 300 … Continue reading even if we die !”
One after another, the memorials were sent directly to Wu Ying Hall.
It wasn’t just the imperial censors who voiced their opinions; officials from the six ministries were also unwilling to remain silent and wrote memorials to impeach.
Some people even aimed their accusations directly at Xu Huizu, the Duke of Wei, and labeled him as “meddling in the affairs of the Harem, without a sense of shame”.
Even the obscure astronomical bureau also made a fuss, saying, “unexpected celestial phenomena during the night observations.”
Zhu Yunwen sat in the Wuying hall, relishing the content of these memorials.
These officials were certainly not lacking in talent, Their words were eloquent, their rhetoric well-structured, and their language flowed smoothly, all while refraining from using vulgar language to insult others.
“Say, is a woman entering the Imperial Academy enough to frighten the entire court of civil officials? Are women so terrifying?”
Zhu Yunwen said to Ma Enhui, who was holding the child beside him.
Ma Enhui chuckled and said: “Your Majesty, I already expressed my concerns beforehand. You know it’s inappropriate, so why did you still proceed in this manner? It’s only natural that the officials oppose it.”
Zhu Yunwen beckoned, and said to the eunuch, Shuangxi, next to him: “Return these memorials to the ones who wrote them. You will ask them a few questions on my behalf.”
Shuangxi asked, “What question does your majesty want me to ask them?”
Zhu Yunwen chuckled and said, “Just ask them, is their mother literate? No, it should be, does your mother know how to read? Does your wife know how to read? Does your daughter know how to read? Are they willing to learn?”
Shuangxi opened his mouth and looked at Ma Enhui’s difficulty. Ma Enhui remained silent and lowered her head, so Shuangxi had no choice but to agree, prepared to leave with the memorials.
“wait.”
Zhu Yunwen stopped Shuang Xi and instructed: “Go with them to their homes. Let them ask their own mothers and wives, take notes, and give me a reply.”
Shuangxi agreed and quickly made the arrangements.
Ma Enhui suddenly laughed, looked at Zhu Yunwen, and said, “Your Majesty, this move of yours has a bit of spirit of a bandit.”
Zhu Yunwen laughed heartily.
Dealing with this group of stubborn people, reasoning with them directly wouldn’t work
“The Analects[2]The Analects (Chinese: 論語; pinyin: Lúnyǔ; Old Chinese: [r]u[n] ŋ(r)aʔ; meaning “Selected Sayings”), also known as the Analects of … Continue reading” also states that a gentleman should prioritize the fundamentals, for it is from the establishment of the fundamentals that virtue arises. Filial piety and fraternal respect are the foundations of benevolence.
Since you scholars emphasize filial piety and fraternal respect, you cannot disregard the words of your own mothers, right?
Send them off to reflect on their intentions only then we can discuss the matter of Xu Miaojin.
“Report to the Emperor, Hanlin Lecturer Fang Xiaoru seeks an audience.”
The eunuch reported.
Zhu Yunwen agreed, and a thin man of about forty years old, wearing a ninth-grade green official robe with a round collar walked in.
This was none other than Fang Xiaoru who had his “ten generations[3]TL’s note: In addition to his own execution, his blood relations and their spouses were killed, along with all of his students and peers as the 10th group.)” executed by Zhu Di!



If … Continue reading was hailed by Zhu Yuanzhang as the “foremost founding civil official.”
According to reason, since Zhu Yuanzhang valued Fang Xiaoru and summoned him twice, his official career should have been prosperous. However, Zhu Yuanzhang chose not to employ Fang Xiaoru himself but instead passed him on to his son. After his son’s death, the position was again inherited by his grandson, who is the current Zhu Yunwen.
Zhu Yunwen sighed heavily. If history were to unfold as it did, when Zhu Di invaded the capital, Fang Xiaoru would have met his demise along with more than eight hundred others. It is undeniable that he was a loyal minister, an eternal loyal minister at that! When faced with Zhu Di’s slaughter, his indomitable spirit and righteousness were unmatched by anyone.
His belief was encapsulated in the phrase “To sacrifice oneself for righteousness, rather than seeking to preserve one’s life at the expense of righteousness.” It was the belief of a scholar. He chose death over submission, death over serving two masters.
However, his abilities did not match his position. Zhu Yunwen’s failure in the struggle against Zhu Di can be attributed to this mismatch. He bears a great responsibility for his “loyal advice.”
After granting a seat to Fang Xiaoru, Zhu Yunwen looked at him. Although Fang Xiaoru had a pale complexion, his eyes were bright and determined. Zhu Yunwen asked, “Mr. Fang, are you here for the matter of Chief Xu?”
Upon hearing this, Fang Xiaoru smiled lightly and said, “The ‘Rites of Zhou[4]The Rites of Zhou (Chinese: 周禮), originally known as “Officers of Zhou” (周官; Zhouguan) is a Chinese work on bureaucracy and organizational theory.’ have long mentioned the role of female officials. Although they serve within the inner court, considering Chief Xu’s position, it is only about selecting talents for Your Majesty. As long as Chief Xu conducts himself with integrity and adheres to proper etiquette, there should be no issue.”
“Oh?”
Zhu Yunwen was somewhat surprised.
He thought Fang Xiaoru was a rigid bookworm, but he didn’t expect him to know how to be flexible.
“This Subject came here not to speak about Chief Xu, but to discuss the governance through culture.” Fang Xiaoru said seriously.
“Go on.” Zhu Yunwen signaled.
Fang Xiaoru spoke confidently: “Having resided in a remote place for a long time and now being in the capital, I have received Your Majesty’s gracious favor and taken up the position of Hanlin attendant lecturer. I have witnessed Your Majesty’s emphasis on Confucianism and literary pursuits, with the intention of governance through culture. And in my opinion, if we are to pursue governance through culture, we should uphold the principles of ‘Courtesy’.”
“What do you mean Mr.Fang?” Zhu Yunwen frowned.
Fang Xiaoru spoke frankly, “Is Your Majesty summoning the King of Yan to the capital with the intention of reducing his power?”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Fang Xiaoru without saying anything.
Fang Xiaoru continued, “I earnestly implore Your Majesty not to do so. Although the King of Yan is the leader of the northern fiefs, he has committed no wrongs. If he is summoned to the capital and his power is forcefully reduced, it would be a breach of etiquette. Moreover, it has only been a little over a month since the passing of the founding emperor, and if Your Majesty were to take action against the King of Yan, it may chill the hearts of the people.”
Zhu Yunwen waved his hand and smiled, “Mr. Fang, you worry too much. I am summoning the King of Yan to the capital as a means to rectify past mistakes. Our dynasty upholds the principles of benevolence and filial piety. If the royal family cannot uphold these principles, how can we set an example for the people?”
“Is that so?”
“Indeed. To alleviate the concerns of the King of Yan, I have also issued orders to reduce the military by 100,000 troops, to demonstrate that we have no intention of reducing the vassal king’s power. At the same time, these troops will be used for civilian purposes, opening up new lands in the southern mountains. Isn’t that even better?”
“Your Majesty is wise and enlightened.”
Fang Xiaoru expressed his joy and prostrated himself.
After sending away Fang Xiaoru, Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng arrived.
Upon hearing the news of reducing the military by 100,000 troops, they became even more fearful and anxious, hastily submitting their petitions. However, Zhu Yunwen ignored their memorial, leaving it aside.
Seeing no response, the two of them sought an audience directly.
“Your Majesty, it is absolutely crucial not to reduce the military at this time…”
“Please reconsider your decree…”
The two of them pleaded back and forth, causing Zhu Yunwen to feel distressed.
In the end, there seemed to be no solution.
After praising Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng for their unwavering loyalty, Zhu Yunwen assured them that it would not affect the military’s combat capabilities. Even if there were reductions, troops could be relocated from the border regions to maintain stability. This reassured the two officials.
Once they left, Zhu Yunwen picked up a memorial written by the Right Vice Minister of Justice, Yuan Tai. In it, there was a sentence that criticized Xie Jin for coming to the capital before the mourning period for his mother had ended and when his father was ninety years old, stating that it was inappropriate.
This is an attack on Xie Jin who came to the capital to mourn.
It was because of this memorial by this old bro, Xie Jin, one of the three great talents of the Ming Dynasty and later the compiler of the “Yongle Encyclopedia[5]The Yongle Encyclopedia (English: /jɒŋlə/) or Yongle Dadian (traditional Chinese: 永樂大典; simplified Chinese: 永乐大典; pinyin: Yǒnglè … Continue reading,” was sent to Gansu to suffer hardships.
A smile appeared at the corner of Zhu Yunwen’s mouth as he softly said, “Xie Jin, should I have you compile a “Jianwen Encyclopedia” for me? Hehe. Guards, summon Xie Jin to the palace.”

Chapter 6: Top Student Xie Jin Answering the Emperor
The name of Xie Jin, will not disappear from history.
He was a rare genius in the Ming dynasty. It can even be said that he played a very crucial role in the direction of the Ming Dynasty.
If it weren’t for Xie Jin’s remark of “Good Holy Grandson”, it would be difficult to predict who will be the Ming dynasty’s future emperor.
Zhu Yunwen couldn’t help shaking his head when he recalled Xie Jin’s “Top Student” journey.
Xie Jin recited a poem at the age of 5, wrote an essay at the age of 7, read thoroughly “four books and five classics” at the age of 12, become first placed candidate in the provincial imperial exam at the age of 18, At nineteen he placed tenth in the 3rd Rank of the 5th Year Presented Scholar exam. he was granted the treatment same as a Scholar, and the title of “all good men of virtue”.
Zhu Yuanzhang appreciated Xie Jin’s talent, and appointed him as an advisor in the imperial court, promoting him to the position of Hanlin Academician.
At the age of nineteen, he had already reached the height that countless people admired.
Upon careful consideration of future generations, at the age of nineteen, one is typically still studying.
However, it is not necessarily a good thing to hold a high position at a young age, lack of social experience can lead to arrogance and conceit, Xie Jin, being too idealistic, ultimately paid a price.
In just a couple of years, he didn’t rise in rank but managed to offend quite a few people.
Today he criticizes an official for neglecting their duties, tomorrow he points out the negligence of the Ministry of War, and the day after tomorrow he writes a memorial to challenge the authority of the great boss, Zhu Yuanzhang.
As a result, Xie Jin became alienated and isolated.
When the minister of war, Shen Qian, accused Xie Jin, not a single person stood up to speak for him. Zhu Yuanzhang had no choice but to dismiss Xie Jin and sent him to conduct inspection in Jiangxi.
After being driven out of the capital city, Xie Jin, still trying to make a fuss, and was ordered by Zhu Yuanzhang to ‘stay at home and focus on studying’.
Zhu Yuanzhang left a remark for Xie Jin’s father, saying, “It is not too late to make great use of him in the next ten years.” This implied that Zhu Yuanzhang wanted Xie Jin to return to his duties after ten years.
However, seven years later, Zhu Yuanzhang passed away. Xie Jin clearly didn’t want to wait for a “ten-year period”. Upon hearing the news, he immediately used the excuse of mourning and hurried to the capital, preparing for a comeback.
And so, the present meeting took place.
Zhu Yunwen looked at Xie Jin with interest. Xie Jin was short and thin, with an unremarkable appearance.
“Xie Jin, humbly paying respect to your majesty.” Xie Jin knelt down and respectfully greeted.
Zhu Yunwen smiled faintly and waved his hand, saying: “have a seat”
Xie Jin sat on the chair but barely touched its edge.
Zhu Yunwen didn’t seem bothered and took out Yuan Tai’s impeachment memorial, instructing someone to hand it to Xie Jin.
“After you have read it, you may respond.”
Xie Jin quickly took the memorial, opened it, and his expression turned fearful. He immediately knelt down and exclaimed,:” I am guilty.”
Zhu Yunwen asked, “Guilty of what?”
Xie Jin’s forehead was covered in cold sweat as he hurriedly replied, “I should not have left home while my mother’s funeral rites were unfinished. It was unfilial of me.”
“Knowing it was unfilial, why did you come to the capital?” Zhu Yunwen asked, understanding the situation.
In ancient times, filial piety was highly esteemed. If you held an official position in the court and your parents passed away, regardless of your rank, you were required to resign from your official duties and return home to observe mourning for twenty-seven months, starting from the day you received the news of the bereavement.
There was a specific term for this: “dingyou (丁忧).”
In general, the imperial court does not allow the forced appointment of individuals in mourning as officials.
If it is deemed necessary under special circumstances to forcefully appoint someone in mourning as an official, it is called “duoqing (夺情).
The term “duoqing(夺情)” is rarely used, but once employed, it will inevitably face fierce criticism from the civil officials.
For example, Zhang Juzheng, the most powerful Senior Grand Secretary of Ming Dynasty, was labeled as “unfilial” due to his appointment during mourning. Even after his death, Emperor Wanli held onto this matter, harboring deep resentment towards Zhang Juzheng.
Xie Jin quickly kowtowed and exclaimed,: “Your majesty, I came to the capital to mourn, also driven by filial piety.”
“oh?”
Upon hearing this, Zhu Yunwen looked intently at Xie Jin and his words.
Xie Jin continued to plead, “Your Majesty, this humble subject’s journey to the capital during mourning is also an expression of filial piety. Emperor Taizu treated me as a loyal subject, but his favor was akin to that of a father. My act of mourning for my father is a clear manifestation of filial devotion.”
A faint smile appeared at the corner of Zhu Yunwen’s mouth.
Indeed, Zhu Yuanzhang had once regarded Jie Jin as a father and son when they dined together in the Dapao (大庖)[1]Dapao refers to Kitchen in the imperial palace during the Ming dynasty. It was one of the several kitchens in the palace complex responsible for preparing meals for the emperor, his family, and the … Continue reading West Chamber, encouraging Jie Jin to speak candidly and express his opinions freely.
It was from this moment that the famous ten-thousand-word memorial, “Memorial of Dapao West Chamber,” came to be in history.
Zhu Yunwen looked at Xie Jin appreciatively, nodding slightly, and said, “Taizu valued you greatly. Now that I have just taken power, I need capable individuals. Xie Jin, enter the Hanlin Academy and become a Hanlin attendant lecturer.”
Xie Jin was overjoyed and quickly expressed his gratitude, saying, “Thank you, Your Majesty, for your grace.”
Emperor Zhu Yunwen nodded and said, “Rise.”
Suppressing his excitement, Xie Jin stood up.
The Hanlin Academy was a prestigious institution composed of scholars and intellectuals who served as advisers and aides to the emperor. The highest-ranking official in the Imperial Academy was the Academician whose authority was nearly equivalent to that of the Prime Minister.
Entering the Hanlin Academy signifies stepping into the center of imperial power.
“What is your opinion on the current state of the court?” Zhu Yunwen asked.
Reflecting for a moment, Xie Jin spoke with lowered hands, “Your Majesty, in my humble opinion, it is crucial to stabilize the court internally by consolidating the official’s support. Externally, it is necessary to reduce the power of regional kings and centralize military authority.”
Zhu Yunwen glanced at Xie Jin, and asked, “More specific.”
Xie Jin solemnly responded, “During the reign of Emperor Taizu, there was strict discipline, and the officials lived in fear and anxiety. Even the ministers of the Six Ministries were anxious. Your Majesty, the officials have long yearned for your benevolence. If Your Majesty implements a policy of leniency, rectifying the existing malpractices, you will surely win the hearts of the people. Once the hearts of the people are aligned, the court will be as stable as Mount Tai.”
“As for external affairs, Emperor Taizu appointed the nine powerful border kings, granting them significant military power. However, their authority is not based solely on military might, but rather on the system of feudal enfeoffment. Overcoming this predicament is not a difficult task.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at the confident Xie Jin and asked, “How can we overcome this predicament?”
Xie Jin’s said frankly: ”Relocate the vassal kings, steadily reduce their power.”
Zhu Yunwen fell into deep thought,
Xie Jin spoke from the side: “I have heard that the King of Gu, King of Liao, and King of Su have repeatedly petitioned for relocation of their fiefs, but they were rejected by Emperor Taizu. Now that Your Majesty holds the reins of power, you can bestow favor upon the border Kings by selecting suitable locations for their fiefdoms. This will serve as an example for the other border Kings.”
Zhu Yunwen nods slightly, indicating approval of this option.
In fact, the border king’s armies are all under the control of the imperial court, despite being under the jurisdiction and command of the border kings themselves. Their purpose is solely to defend against the Mongols and safeguard the frontier.
If they are relocated internally, they would lose their military authority and naturally pose no threat. However, some individuals cant be resolved by simply changing their location.
For example, the King of Ning and the King of Qin, who have a large number of troops and capable generals, as well as the Prince of Yan, known for his military prowess.
Without waiting for Zhu Yunwen to ask, Xie Jin spoke frankly, “Among the nine border Kings, in terms of military strength and numbers, the most prominent ones are the King of Ning, the King of Qin, and the King of Yan. However, the King of Qin passed away early, and his successor is just a child, so he can hardly be considered a threat. The Prince of Ning commands 80,000 elite troops, but he is situated outside the borders. If he loses the supply and support from the imperial court, his survival will be difficult.”
Zhu Yunwen frowned slightly, not entirely convinced with Xie Jin’s theoretical analysis.
Although the Prince of Ning is located outside the borders and heavily relies on logistical support from the imperial court, if there is a failure in a timely blockade, the King of Ning could lead his troops to capture the strategic city of Datong, directly confronting Beiping Prefecture.
In history, Zhu Di (later Emperor Yongle) took advantage of King of Ning and brought his forces to Beiping, thereby strengthening his power.
Xie Jin only focused attention on Zhu Di, the King of Yan, stating that Zhu Di was the “foremost among the Kings,” making him difficult to handle. Xie Jin proposed a strategy of prioritizing benevolence and governance before resorting to military force.
Zhu Yunwen smiled and appreciated Xie Jin’s perspective, encouraging him to serve the court diligently.
After Xie Jin left, Zhu Yunwen remained silent for a long time. Finally, he sighed and said, “their perspectives are still somewhat narrow. It seems that it’s time to establish the Grand Secretariat[2]The Grand Secretariat (Chinese: 內閣; pinyin: Nèigé) was nominally a coordinating agency but de facto the highest institution in the imperial government of the Chinese Ming dynasty. It … Continue reading.”

Chapter 7: The Starting Point of Care, People Around Us
With a cheerful smile, Shuangxi entered the palace and approached the entrance of the Wuying Hall. He rubbed his face and walked inside cautiously. He respectfully reported, “Your Majesty, those ministers have all become more restrained.”
Indeed.
A mother is unable to read or have knowledge, how can she teach her children to read and understand?
A wife desires to appreciate poetry, literature, and art, but cannot read, how can she cultivate elegance?
A daughter also wishes to attend school, why should only boys have the privilege of reading?
It is unfair.
Although no one directly mentions breaking the “Three Obediences and Four Virtues” or the “Three Fundamental Bonds and Five Constant Virtues,” the inner desire for education is a reality that can’t be ignored.
Zhu Yunwen does not care about these disturbances. Even the Imperial Academy did not say anything. The commotion caused by these people is nothing more than a waste of paper, ink, and saliva.
The news of the disarmament of 100,000 troops finally stirred up a sensation within the imperial capital.
No one expected that the new emperor would possess such determination and means to easily disband one hundred thousand troops with a wave of his hand. Throughout history, it is more common to hear of emperors expanding their armies rather than demobilizing them.
As a result, the civil officials believed that an era of “civil governance” was about to begin, and they eagerly presented memorials praising the emperor as a wise ruler. As for minor matters like Xu Miaojin, not many people paid much attention to them.
Yù Xīn, the Minister of Revenue, smiled and said to Xia Yuánjí, an official in the Ministry of Revenue, “The emperor’s actions are truly remarkable.”
Xia Yuánjí nodded and said, “Yù-dàrén, it seems that the Ministry of Revenue will save a considerable amount of funds and provisions this year.”
Yù Xīn took a relaxed sip of tea and said with relief, “Indeed. Cavalry soldiers consume two dan of grain per month, while ordinary soldiers consume one dan. And that’s just the ration expenses. The capital city alone incurs heavy costs. By reducing one hundred thousand troops, we can save 3.6 million shi of grain annually. Now that summer has arrived, there are frequent rainstorms, repairs needed for river embankments, and disaster relief efforts—all of which require funds and provisions.” [1]TL’s note: 1 dan during the Ming dynasty is 141,7 catty, 1 catty is 500 gram. They are talking about soldier’s salary here.
“The matters of the Ministry of Revenue are indeed challenging.” Xia Yuánjí joked.
Yù Xīn chuckled and said, “Wéi Zhé, you have to bear more responsibilities. The affairs of the Ministry of Revenue will require your extra effort.”
Xia Yuan Ji, courtesy name Wei Zhe.
Xia Yuanji nodded solemnly and looked at the somewhat aged Yù Xīn. He slowly said, “Is the disarmament of the troops related to the summoning of the King of Yan to the capital?”
A gleam flashed in Yù Xīn’s eyes, and he chuckled, “Our Emperor is indeed extraordinary. Have you heard? Xie Jīn has already entered the Hanlin Academy.”
“Yes, I’ve heard. Xie Jīn, during the time of Emperor Taizu, though arrogant and frivolous, was truly a person of integrity. It’s good to have someone like him by the Emperor’s side.” Xia Yuanji praised.
 Yu Xin stood up and walked up to Xia Yuanji, saying, “It’s strange indeed. When His Majesty was the Crown Prince, Qi Tai, and Huang Zicheng were his associates in the Eastern Palace. But now, despite His Majesty’s reign, Qi Tai remains the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of War, and Huang Zicheng is still a Compiler in the Hanlin Academy. This is quite unusual.”
For a newly enthroned emperor, the first officials to be appointed are often those close to him. However, even though Emperor Taizu has been resting in the Mausoleum for some time, the new emperor hasn’t bestowed favor on his old comrades. Surprisingly the first person to be promoted is none other than Xie Jin, who has been away from the court for many years.
“Perhaps his majesty has other plans in mind.” Xia Yuanji calmly said.
Zhu Yunwen remains secluded in the deep palace and does not attend court.
In the court, the officials look anxiously, searching left and right, but Zhu Yunwen is nowhere to be seen.
Memorials after memorials are submitted, yet no one grant approval. How can they handle affairs?
Does the Ming Dynasty still have any function left?
Some lower-ranking officials even speculate whether the emperor, due to excessive worries over the passing of the previous emperor, has fallen ill. They inquire around, hoping to submit memorials to express their loyalty.
Zhu Yunwen walks out of the Wuying Hall, observing the sun slowly setting, casting darkness upon the majestic palace. If it weren’t for the clear memories from the future, Zhu Yunwen would have forgotten where he came from.
“Shuangxi, do you miss your family?”
Zhu Yunwen gently asked.
Eunuch Shuangxi looked at him in astonishment. During the reign of Zhu Yuanzhang, the treatment of eunuchs was extremely harsh, with severe punishments for even minor mistakes, ranging from leg-breaking to death. Even after Zhu Yunwen ascended the throne, this strictness continued.
The current display of care and inquiry was almost unimaginable.
Indeed, historically, Zhu Yunwen did not consider eunuchs as individuals.
During Zhu Di’s rebellion, many eunuchs became spies for Zhu Di because he treated them as individuals and trusted them.
The notorious ‘Eastern Depot[2]Eastern Depot or Eastern Bureau (traditional Chinese: 東廠; simplified Chinese: 东厂; pinyin: Dōng Chǎng; Wade–Giles: Tung Ch’ang) was … Continue reading’, an institution led by eunuchs, which gained great fame in later generations, is a testament to Zhu Di’s trust in eunuchs.
Moved by his words, Shuangxi felt like crying and quickly replied, “Your Majesty, I occasionally think of them, but unfortunately, I have no chance to see them again.”
Zhu Yunwen shook his head and said, “Why can’t you see them?”
Shuangxi respectfully replied, “As I entered the palace, I became Your Majesty’s subject. How could I see them again? Besides, even if I were to return, they would not recognize me.”
Shuangxi’s words were accurate.
In ancient times, importance was placed on lineage and family inheritance.
An eunuch was not qualified to enter the ancestral shrine and was often looked down upon at, at least during the early Ming Dynasty.
Zhu Yunwen looked at the desolate Shuangxi and asked, “Is it the same for everyone in the harem?”
“Naturally,” Shuangxi quickly replied.
As Zhu Yunwen walked, he noticed a palace maid kneeling by the side of the road, carrying a food container. He stopped and asked, “Where are you from?”
The palace maid replied with fear and respect, “Your Majesty, this humble servant is from Suzhou.”
“Suzhou, ah! I have been there. Do you know the Lion Grove Garden[3]The Lion Grove Garden (simplified Chinese: 狮子林园; traditional Chinese: 獅子林園; pinyin: Shī Zǐ Lín Yuán; Suzhou Wu: Sy tsy lin yoe, Wu … Continue reading?” Zhu Yunwen recalled his visit to the Lion Grove Garden in later years and asked with a smile.
The palace maid shook her head.
Zhu Yunwen sighed and said, “What a pity. However, the Lion Grove Garden might not have been established yet. How long has it been since you last saw your parents and family?”
“It has been three years, Your Majesty,” the palace maid replied softly.
Zhu Yunwen rubbed his temples and said to Shuangxi, “Go and have Kunji summoned.”
Shuangxi signaled to a eunuch next to him.
Zhu Yunwen opened the food box carried by the palace maid and glanced inside. There were only some light dishes. He asked, “Who is this for?”
The palace maid hurriedly replied, “It’s for the Consort Ning.”
Zhu Yunwen narrowed his eyes, pondered for a moment, and then remembered the consort. He said to the palace maid, “Such light dishes are not suitable. Come with me, we’ll go to the Imperial Kitchen.”
The palace maid couldn’t go against the Emperor’s command.
Shuangxi followed along, puzzled by the situation.
In the Imperial Kitchen, which was responsible for the Emperor’s and the palace’s meals and banquets, the Chief of the Imperial Kitchen, Liu Yizheng, was humming a tune, leisurely sipping wine. He would give a few orders when there was nothing else to do, but overall, he led a comfortable life.
However, when Liu Yizheng saw Zhu Yunwen approaching while he had the wine jug at his mouth, he was dumbfounded and froze in place for a moment.
Shuangxi quickly gave a signal from the side, and Liu Yizheng immediately knelt down, bowing and apologizing.
Zhu Yunwen didn’t even spare a glance at Liu Yizheng. He looked at the numerous ingredients in the kitchen and pondered. He realized that he was only skilled in a few home-cooked dishes.
However, he wondered if the emperor was cooking, would invite criticism from officials?
Whatever.
Kung Pao Chicken [4]Kung Pao chicken (Chinese: 宫保鸡丁; pinyin: Gōngbǎo jīdīng; Wade–Giles: Kung¹-pao³ Chi¹-ting¹), also transcribed Gong Bao or Kung Po, … Continue reading, Yuxiang shredded pork[5]Yuxiang shredded pork (simplified Chinese: 鱼香肉丝; traditional Chinese: 魚香肉絲; pinyin: yúxiāng ròusī; sometimes translated as fish-flavored pork … Continue reading didn’t exist in the Ming dynasty era, those dishes had to wait until the Republican era. The Shangshan Bureau certainly wouldn’t have learned them. If I don’t take matters into my own hands, even eating becomes a problem…
During the period of mourning, indulging in extravagant seafood and meat is not allowed. But if I cook the dish and just pick out the meat, wouldn’t that solve the problem…

Chapter 8: Yu Xiang Shredded pork benefits the lower class
Shuangxi clung to Zhu Yunwen’s legs, crying out and pleading for him not to cook. he even said, “A nobleman should stay away from the kitchen” he had never seen an emperor cook before.
He was tossed aside by Zhu Yunwen.
Nonsense, do you really think I’ve never read a book?
In the “Mencius, King Hui of Liang” chapter, it says: “Regarding birds and animals, when a noble person sees them alive, they cannot bear to see them dead; when they hear their sounds, they cannot bear to eat their flesh. Therefore, noble persons keep their distance from the kitchen.”
In the “Book of Rites, Jade Carvings” there are similar words left behind: “Noble persons keep their distance from the kitchen, they do not tread upon any living beings with blood and breath.”
The original intention is to tell the king that one should have benevolence and should not advocate or engage in killing, and it has nothing to do with “being ashamed of the kitchen.”
Furthermore, what has never seen an emperor cook before?
Did Emperor Taizu Zhu Yuanzhang not personally cook when he was a beggar?
If he picked wild vegetables from the roadside, it would still require cooking, wouldn’t it?
Liu Yi kept kowtowing, blood dripping from his forehead, yet he still goes on saying that the Imperial Kitchen has let the emperor down, and as long as the emperor says a word, he will immediately find a rope to end his own life.
Just cooking a meal, why so many things to fuss about?
Zhu Yunwen became angry and ordered Shuangxi to stand aside, instructing everyone from the Imperial Kitchen to watch. Then he picked up a knife and gave a threatening glance to Shuangxi, who was about to approach. He grabbed a carrot and started chopping it.
Shuangxi was stunned.
The people from the Imperial Kitchen also widened their eyes in surprise.
The palace maid on the side had her mouth wide open, staring motionlessly.
The emperor knows how to chop vegetables?
How strange! How could the emperor possibly know how to chop vegetables, and he even cut them into thin shreds.
Wood ear mushrooms?
Chinese lettuce?
Meat?
Oh my God, the emperor actually wants to eat meat during the period of mourning?
This goes against etiquette.
If the civil officials were to find out, wouldn’t it cause a major uproar?
Shuangxi stared at the people from the Imperial Kitchen, indicating that whoever dared to leak any information would face consequences.
The people from the Imperial Kitchen had no interest in looking at Shuangxi’s gaze. They were sweating profusely, fearing that if the emperor were to cut his hand, they might lose their heads.
“Light the fire.”
Zhu Yunwen finished cutting the ingredients and put some vinegar in a bowl. He looked at the hard, yellow sugar cubes and sighed.
During the early Ming Dynasty, refined white sugar was not yet available.
White refined sugar appeared during the Jiajing emperor’s reign of the Ming Dynasty. Later, when Song Yingxing wrote ‘The Exploitation of heavenly treasures’ he specifically described the production method of refined rock sugar in a section called ‘Gan Shi’ (Sweet Cravings).
Zhu Yunwen was uncertain whether the Jiajing emperor’s reign would occur in the future, after all it was Zhu Di’s lineage.
There was also a gap of two hundred years between him and Shen Kuo[1]Shen Kuo (Chinese: 沈括; 1031–1095) or Shen Gua, courtesy name Cunzhong (存中) and pseudonym Mengqi (now usually given … Continue reading, It’s unreliable to expect them, to enjoy the privilege of having white sugar.
Ma Enhui hurriedly arrived at the Imperial kitchen from the Chang’an Palace. Upon entering, she happened to see Zhu Yunwen cooking and was so shocked that she almost fainted. She looked at the eunuchs, palace maids, and Shangshanjian staff standing idly by, Ma Enhui was on the verge of losing her temper.
“Don’t be angry, it was I who ordered them to stand aside,” Zhu Yunwen said.
Zhu Yunwen scooped two portions of Yuxiang Shredded pork , picked out a portion of the shredded pork, and called over the palace maid from before. He instructed her, “Take this and bring it to consort Ning.”
The palace maid expressed her thanks and carefully placed it in a food container before quickly leaving.
“My beloved consort, come and taste it.”
Zhu Yunwen motioned to Ma Enhui.
Ma Enhui looked at Zhu Yunwen with confusion, uncertain, and asked, “How could Your Majesty know how to do such… thing?”
Mid-sentence, she stopped herself from uttering the word “lowly.”
Zhu Yunwen picked up the chopsticks and handed them to Ma Enhui, saying, “A bowl of porridge, a meal, one should cherish the origin of its scarcity; a thread, a piece of cloth, one should always remember the toil behind its production. These days, I have been contemplating that food is of utmost importance to the people. If even our royal family doesn’t understand how to be frugal, how can we effectively guide the masses?”
Ma Enhui looked at Zhu Yunwen, gracefully bowed, and exclaimed, “A bowl of porridge, a meal, one should cherish the origin of its scarcity; a thread, a piece of cloth, one should always remember the toil behind its production. Your Majesty’s wisdom is a blessing to the people.”
“Your Majesty is wise.”
Shuangxi and the members of the Imperial kitchen quickly knelt down and echoed in unison.
Zhu Yunwen waved his hand and said, “Rise, everyone. Let’s refrain from extravagance and waste in the future. Unless necessary, let the breakfast and dinner be reduced from twelve courses to six, and the lunch from twenty-four courses to twelve.”
“Since Your Majesty has set an example, the meals in the harem should also be reduced accordingly.”
Ma Enhui quickly suggested.
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and said, “The Consorts and concubines should not waste, but the meals of the lower-ranking palace maids and eunuchs should be enhanced, They should not have fewer than two dishes. Let the Imperial kitchen learn this dish and distribute it to them as well.”
Ma Enhui expressed gratitude on behalf of the palace maids and eunuchs, and under Zhu Yunwen’s encouragement, she took a bite of the Yuxiang Shredded pork, Her eyes lit up, and her hands moved faster. She ate a few more bites and then looked at Zhu Yunwen with a slightly embarrassed expression. She exclaimed, “Your Majesty, for the dinner, I would like to have this dish.”
“Haha, would the beloved consort like to try learning it?”
“Can I learn it too?”
“Why not? Liu Yi, prepare the ingredients…”
Zhu Yunwen smiled and called out.
Outside the Imperial City, near the Desheng Gate(Gate of Virtuous Triumph), the Laundry Bureau.
The palace maid, Luo Yan’er, tiredly leaned against a pillar, looking up at the night sky, and sighing deeply. Her stomach grumbled and growled loudly.
It was so late, yet they weren’t allowed to eat. She heard that the female official in charge was summoned to the palace. She wondered if it was because there was an issue with the laundry she had washed or if there was some favor bestowed upon the palace.
But regardless, it had nothing to do with her.
The lowly palace maid could only live a lowly existence.
Luo Yan’er remembered her father, who was executed due to Lan Yu[2]Lan Yu (died 1393) was a Chinese military general and politician in the early Ming dynasty. His ancestral home was in present-day Dingyuan County, Anhui. In 1393, Lan Yu was … Continue reading Case, and her mother, who couldn’t bear the pain and took her own life. Their once-warm family was shattered in an instant.
Her uncle had sold her to the palace, unfortunately she had no money to bribe anyone. She had offended a eunuch in charge and was ultimately assigned to the Laundry Bureau, living a life worse than death, all for a meager meal.
That was all there was to it.
But now even meals are not to be served on time.
*Gurgle*.
Her stomach growled once again. Outside, she could hear the clamor of excitement, indicating that the palace had arranged some rewards.
“Sister Yan’er, Sister Yan’er, come quickly!”
A palace maid in her late teens emerged from a distance, calling out loudly.
Luo Yan’er felt a pang in her stomach and couldn’t get up, so she waved her hand in the direction of the maid.
The maid turned around and walked out. Not long after, she came running back with two food containers in her hands, a smile beaming on her face. She placed the food containers next to Luo Yan’er and said, “Well, this is our dinner.”
“Dinner? Qiao Hui, are you sure you didn’t make a mistake?”
Luo Yan’er looked at the food containers.
Since joining the laundry bureau, she had never used these food containers before. During meal times, there was always someone arranging the food, and they would go to a separate compartment near the large stove to eat. If they were late, there might be nothing left to eat, leaving them with empty stomachs.
Eating from food containers?
This is unheard of.
Qiao Hui smiled brightly, holding her own food container, and said, “Sister, take a look.”
Perplexed, Luo Yan’er opened the food container and saw a serving of cabbage, which was a common dish they had during regular meals. After removing the cabbage, she looked inside and found another dish.
Red, green, black… Ah?
And there’s meat too?
How is this possible?
Luo Yan’er looked at Qiao Hui in astonishment.
Qiao Hui leaned in beside Luo Yan’er and opened her food container. Inside, the dishes were exactly the same as Luo Yan’er’s. She said, “I just heard about it. This dish is called Yuxiang Shredded pork, a delicious delicacy introduced today by the Imperial kitchen.”
Luo Yan’er swallowed and asked in disbelief, “How could the dishes from the Imperial Kitchen reach our laundry bureau?”
Seeing that there was no one around, Qiao Hui whispered, “I heard that this dish was invented by the Emperor himself, who ordered that all palace maids and eunuchs must have at least two dishes per meal.”
Surprised, Luo Yan’er picked up her chopsticks, took a gentle bite, and her eyes became moist. She whispered, “The grace of his Majesty…”

Chapter 9: New Regulations in the Imperial Harem and the Grand Secretariat
The reform in the Ming court had yet to begin, but the reform in the imperial harem quietly commenced.
On the 15th of June in the 31st year of the Hongwu reign (1398), Ma Enhui summoned the six bureaus and twenty-four offices of the imperial harem and announced a brand-new system. It included arrangements for food allocation, and daily routines, and innovatively introduced a system of visiting family and monthly rest days.
Both the palace maids and eunuchs were granted two days off each month, during which they were free to leave the palace and visit their families without constraint.
During the Spring Festival, palace maids were allowed to return home for half a month, with the possibility of extending the duration of the journey was long.
To ensure the smooth implementation of the new system in the imperial harem, Ma Enhui ordered that no internal officials were allowed to intentionally create obstacles or hinder the palace maids and eunuchs from visiting their families or taking their monthly rest days. Adjustments to their schedules were permitted if necessary.
It was also required that all eunuchs and palace maids who left the palace were prohibited from disclosing any internal secrets. Any breach of confidentiality would result in the cancellation of their leave and visiting privileges for all eunuchs and palace maids in their respective offices or bureaus, followed by disciplinary actions according to the internal palace regulations.
The introduction of the new system in the imperial harem brought joy and excitement to the long-muted palace. Every palace maid and eunuch eagerly spread the news, and some even spontaneously gathered outside the Chang’an Palace, crying and expressing gratitude for the grace of the Emperor and Empress Ma.
Within moments, the titles of “Holy Emperor” and “Holy Empress” spread throughout the entire imperial harem.
Shuangxi stood at the gate of the Chang’an Palace, watching the palace maids and eunuchs kneeling outside. His eyes were filled with tears as he saw Emperor Zhu Yunwen and Empress Ma Enhui emerge. he called out loudly, “Grace of the Emperor, Grace of the Empress!”
The crowd echoed in unison, their voices resounding throughout the inner palace.
Emperor Zhu Yunwen looked at the kneeling crowd with a stern expression and shouted, “If anyone slackens or fails in their duties, I will be angry. Return to your tasks and do not linger here any longer.”
Everyone kneeled once again and thanked them, and dispersed under the guidance of other eunuchs.
“Why are you crying?” Emperor Zhu Yunwen asked as he noticed Shuangxi choking up.
Shuangxi quickly replied, “Your Majesty, it’s just that I am deeply moved. Now, I feel like I have a purpose in life.”
Emperor Zhu Yunwen laughed heartily and said, “You should say that you feel like a human being now.”
Shuangxi nodded tearfully in agreement.
Indeed, that’s true.
During the reign of Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang, eunuchs lived without any dignity. Even the slightest mistake could lead to being beaten to death by Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang himself. Especially in the later period of his reign, he became even more ruthless and cruel in his actions. As a result, all eunuchs and palace maids lived in fear, choosing to remain silent and cautious.
Seeing her husband in a joyful mood, Ma Enhui also relaxed. Walking alongside Zhu Yunwen by the lake, enjoying the beautiful scenery, she couldn’t help but express her concern, saying, “Your Majesty, what is the purpose behind these reforms?”
Zhu Yunwen looked at his reflection in the water, unable to reveal the true reason that he no longer regarded eunuchs as human beings. Eventually, the eunuchs were bribed by Zhu Di and became his people.
“Only by bestowing broad and abundant grace can one become a benevolent ruler,” Zhu Yunchuan said calmly.
Ma Enhui nodded emphatically and echoed, “Your Majesty will surely become a revered ruler for generations to come.”
Zhu Yunwen waved his hand and said, “Let’s not talk about being a revered ruler for now. I simply feel that embarking on this journey without accomplishing something would be a letdown to my aspirations.”
“Embark on this journey?”
Ma Enhui looked at Zhu Yunwen with confusion.
Zhu Yunwen didn’t explain anything. He reached out and held Ma Enhui’s hand, saying, “I entrust the affairs of the inner palace to you from now on. Starting today, I need to focus on managing the court.”
Ma Enhui’s face blushed slightly as Zhu Yunwen held her hand in front of so many palace maids and eunuchs.
“Please rest assured, Your Majesty,” Ma Enhui said, lowering her head.
Zhu Yunwen looked at the shy Ma Enhui, gently pulled her closer, kissed her forehead, and then released her. He left bringing Shuangxi and other eunuchs who is holding back their smiles.
The next day, the court assembly was held in the Hall of Supreme Harmony.
Zhu Yunwen sat on the dragon throne, looking at the civil and military officials present, his gaze filled with determination.
He recognized some of the officials, but there were others whose names he couldn’t recall even from his memories.
Among the central officials, he could still recognize them. There was Chen Di, the Minister of Rites; Yu Xin, the Minister of Revenue; Bao Zhao, the Minister of Justice; Zhang Dan, the Minister of Personnel; Zheng Ci, the Minister of Works; and Ru Chang, the Minister of War.
Ministry of War’s Assistant Minister Qi Tai, Hanlin Academy’s Compiler Huang Zicheng, Hanlin Academy’s Attendant Lecturer Fang Xiaoru, Xie Jin, Duke of Wei Xu Huizu, Duke of Cao Li Jinglong, Marquis of Changxing Geng Bingwen, and other influential officials were also present without exception.
This is the second time during Zhu Yunwen’s reign that he has held court during the period of mourning. The last time was when he ascended the throne.
After contemplating for a long time, Zhu Yunwen realized that he lacked several qualities possessed by Zhu Yuanzhang. Firstly, he did not possess the same level of vigor and ability to handle hundreds of matters in a single day. Secondly, he lacked the ruthless methods of Zhu Yuanzhang, who would execute those he suspected without hesitation, even if there were occasional mistakes. Thirdly, Zhu Yunwen felt he did not possess the high level of wisdom required to control the officials effectively. Lastly, he couldn’t bear the thought of a compact life without leisure activities or moments of relaxation.
In summary, Zhu Yunwen realized that he couldn’t emulate Zhu Yuanzhang’s ability to directly manage the six central ministries, involving himself in every detail and personally attending to all matters, big or small.
Zhu Yuanzhang disliked the idea of sharing power with the Chancellor. Through the “Hu Weiyong Case,” he removed the Chancellor position and consolidated all power within himself. However, Zhu Yuanzhang underestimated the role of the Chancellor and overestimated his energy and capabilities.
Nearly every day, more than 200 memorials were submitted to Zhu Yuanzhang, and the number of matters requiring his approval was no less than 400.
Even though Zhu Yuanzhang had taken care of cows, went to war, and had a good physique, he couldn’t withstand the daily exhaustion. Eventually, he had to compromise and selected a group of scholars from the Hanlin Academy to assist him in reviewing the memorials.
And these scholars from the Hanlin Academy were similar to Zhu Yuanzhang’s secretaries. This was the prototype form of the Ming Dynasty’s Grand Secretariat.
Zhu Yunwen, not wanting to utter phrases like “I have seen the palace at three in the morning,” decided to establish the Grand Secretariat, delegating the power of the Chancellor and Holding the ultimate decision-making authority for himself.
The Imperial Palace Eunuch announces the imperial edict:
“By the mandate of heaven, the Emperor decrees: Since assuming the throne, I have shouldered the responsibility of governing the nation. However, I have come to realize the overwhelming complexity of the myriad affairs, making it impossible for me to attend to all matters with full attention. I am deeply concerned that any negligence may cause harm to the people and bring shame upon the founding emperor. Fortunately, with the assistance of esteemed ministers, the court has maintained order, and the hearts of the people remain united.”
“As I have reached the age of maturity, I acknowledge my limited experience in governance. Therefore, it is fitting for me to seek guidance from virtuous ministers and collectively govern the nation. I have long heard of the exceptional talents and abilities of Yuxin, the Minister of Revenue, Zhang Dan, the Minister of Personnel, and Xie Jin, the Assistant Lecturer of the Hanlin Academy. I hereby appoint Yuxin, Zhang Dan, and Xie Jin as Grand Secretaries and Grand Secretariat Officials, entrusted with the important affairs of the government.” 
“The Wenhua Hall(Hall of Literary Brilliance)[1]The Hall of Literary Brilliance (simplified Chinese: 文华殿; traditional Chinese: 文華殿; pinyin: Wénhuá diàn), or the Hall of Literary … Continue reading shall be transformed into the Grand Secretariat Office. All memorials and reports from the six central ministries and the thirteen provincial administrations shall be submitted to the Grand Secretariat through the Office of Transmission. The Grand Secretariat officials shall review and annotate them before presenting them to the Emperor. After my seal is affixed, they shall be sent to the Office of Transmission, and then transmitted to the six central ministries and the thirteen provincial administrations.”
In ancient times, the Prime Minister held the power of decision-making, policy deliberation, and administrative authority.
The Grand Secretariat system, on the other hand, allocated the power of policy deliberation to the Grand Secretariat while assigning administrative authority to the six ministries. The Emperor retained control over the ultimate decision-making power.
The introduction of the Grand Secretariat left the officials in shock. They looked at each other, somewhat stunned.
Zhu Yuanzhang abolished the position of the Chancellor, but the new emperor ended up appointing three Chancellors in quick succession.
Although they didn’t bear the title of Chancellors, they performed the duties of Chancellors.
The discussions among the officials were heated, but Yuxin, the Minister of Revenue, Zhang Dan, the Minister of Personnel, and Xie Jin, the Assistant Lecturer of the Hanlin Academy, were particularly excited. This was especially true for Xie Jin, who had returned to the capital after seven years and immediately received such an important appointment, demonstrating the Emperor’s deep trust in him.
The three individuals stepped forward and shouted in unison, “Long live the Emperor!”
Zhu Yunwen issued another decree: “Appoint Assistant Minister of Ministry of War, Qi Tai as Minister of Personnel, Hanlin Academy’s compiler Huang Zicheng as Minister of Revenue, Fang Xiaoru as Hanlin Academician supervising the Grand Secretariat .”
Qi Tai, Huang Zicheng, and Fang Xiaoru immediately knelt to express their gratitude.
Zhu Yunwen deviated from historical precedents. In history, Qi Tai became the Minister of War, Huang Zicheng became the Minister of Rites, with the authority to participate in military and state affairs, and Fang Xiaoru almost became the Chancellor.
These three individuals have become Zhu Yunwen’s core advisory team. Eventually, Zhu Di managed to capture Nanjing!
From now on, history is about to be rewritten.
It’s probably best for Qi Tai given his abilities to focus on personnel matters rather than military affairs.
Although Huang Zicheng may not have many extraordinary abilities, if talented individuals were effectively utilized in the Ministry of Revenue, there shouldn’t be any major issues.
As for Fang Xiaoru, a person who strictly adheres to the principles of “Rites of Zhou” having him assist in overseeing the Grand Secretariat will prevent Yuxin, Zhang Dan, and Xie Jin from acting recklessly.
With the establishment of the Imperial Cabinet, Zhu Yunwen can finally allocate more of his energy to the overall situation and military reforms. In Zhu Yunwen’s view, a ruler should not be personally involved in every matter, but rather delegate power appropriately while maintaining control over the overall direction.
Especially now, Zhu Di remains his biggest adversary, necessitating caution and attention.
With the introduction of the Grand Secretariat, it was only natural that the timing of court meetings would be adjusted. Zhu Yunwen decided to hold court meetings on the first and fifteenth day of each month.
On ordinary days, there was no need for everyone to rush on the road in the middle of the night, risking accidents and drowning in ditches.
The workday started at the hour of the Dragon (around 8 a.m.) and ended at the hour of the Rooster (around 5 p.m.), compared to the previous practice of working for more than ten hours. It was indeed a great benefit.
After the court meeting concluded, Zhu Yunwen retained the three Secretaries and Fang Xiaoru for further discussion.
Yuxin, feeling somewhat excited, looked at Zhu Yunwen and suppressed his excitement as he spoke, “Your Majesty, as the Grand Secretariat is newly established, please kindly instruct us on how it should operate.”
The three secretaries were not fools either. They knew that they only held the power to discuss and advise, and they dared not make decisions on their own. Otherwise, they would meet the same fate as Hu Weiyong.
It would be better to clarify the boundaries early on, clearly stating what they could and could not do. This would provide reassurance and enable them to carry out their duties with peace of mind.
Zhu Yunwen looked at the four individuals before him with appreciation and nodded, saying, “I trust in the abilities of the esteemed secretaries to handle the affairs of the Grand Secretariat. I hope you will work together and ensure that the daily tasks are completed on the same day, without delay until the next day. You may select a group of assistants from the Hanlin Academy to support your work. If there are any unresolved matters, you may report them to the Wuying Hall.”
“For matters concerning military affairs, they should be handled by the Five Army Commandery. As for major national affairs such as appointments and dismissals of officials, and the financial matters of the state treasury, they should be promptly submitted for review. In the case of any border conflicts, there must be no delay in reporting them…”
After Zhu Yunwen made the necessary arrangements, he returned to the harem.
The execution capability of the officials in the Ming Dynasty was exceptionally strong. With the transformation of the WenHua Hall into the Grand Secretariat and the appointment of Grand Secretaries, a new vitality began to emerge in the Ming court.
The following day, Zhu Yunwen proclaimed to the world, bringing an end to the unjust cases of the Hongwu era. He granted amnesty to a group of innocent individuals and also reduced the tax in impoverished regions. He instructed the government to provide support and care for widows, orphans, and the disabled, and provide relief for those affected by disasters.
On the third day, arranging Xia Yuanji and others as envoys, to go around Ming dynasty for inspection.

Chapter 10: Dao Yan Offers Advice to King of Yan, Life in the Imperial Academy
Beiping Prefecture.
In the scorching heat of June, the streets and alleys of Beiping are devoid of liveliness.
Inside the King of Yan’s residence, Zhu Di sits upright in his room, flipping through a military book.
“Your Highness.”
Qiu Fu, the commander of the King of Yan’s guards, reported from outside the room. Upon receiving permission, he entered the room and respectfully addressed Zhu Di, saying, “Your Highness, we have received news from the capital summoning Your Highness to enter the capital.”
“To the capital?” Zhu Di looked at Qiu Fu, his face expressing surprise and doubt.
Having traveled a long distance to mourn, Zhu Di was blocked by Mei Yin’s[1]Mei Yin (14th century – 1405), styled Boyin, was the grandson of Marquis of Runan, Mei Sizu, and the son in law of the founding Emperor of Ming Dynasty Zhu Yuanzhang. He was known for his … Continue reading subordinates in Huai’an, and his pleas were not granted. In the end, he had no choice but to send his three sons to mourn on his behalf. Unable to bid a final farewell, Zhu Di knelt towards the direction of the capital in Huai’an, filled with sorrow and resentment returning to Beiping Prefecture.
Just when I haven’t had a peaceful moment, the court summons me to enter the capital.
“Where did the news come from?”
Zhu Di asked in a deep voice.
Qiu Fu quickly said, “My lord, this is the news we gathered from our sources in the capital. And according to them, there is another major event.”
“What event?”
“The Emperor is reducing the army by 100,000 men!”
“What?”
Zhu Di abruptly stood up, his gaze sharp as he stared at Qiu Fu.
Qiu Fu dared not meet his gaze and lowered his head, saying, “My lord, the imperial envoy will arrive within one or two days. Moreover, I have heard that the news of your summons to the capital and the disbanding of the army is already widely known in the capital.”
Zhu Di furrowed his brows tightly and paced anxiously in the room, saying, “I have been informed. You may go now.”
Qiu Fu withdrew from the room.
Zhu Di sat in his chair, his eyes showing a hint of uncertain anxiety.
Zhu Di, currently thirty-nine years old, was appointed as the King of Yan by Zhu Yuanzhang, when he was only eleven years old in the third year of the Hongwu reign (1363). At the age of twenty-one, he was granted the fiefdom of Beiping.
During the early Ming Dynasty, although the Yuan Dynasty had been driven out of the central plains and forced to retreat to the northern regions, it still maintained a formidable force and constantly harbored ambitions of reclaiming the central plains.
Beiping, being the previous center of the Yuan Empire and the capital, naturally held great importance in terms of defense.
At the beginning of his appointment, Zhu Di, along with the King of Qin, the King of Jin, the King of Ning, and other border kings, guarded the northern borders of the Ming Empire.
After purging a group of military commanders from the Hongwu era, Zhu Yuanzhang entrusted his sons with the defense of the empire. In the 23rd and 28th years of the Hongwu reign (1390 and 1395), Zhu Yuanzhang twice ordered Zhu Di to lead expeditions to the northern frontier.
Zhu Di lived up to the expectations and achieved complete victories in both campaigns, earning him great fame.
Zhu Yuanzhang placed great trust in Zhu Di, especially after the deaths of his eldest son, Zhu Biao, his second son, Zhu Zhan, and his third son, Zhu Gan. As the fourth son, Zhu Di became the leader among the various kings.
One month before Zhu Yuanzhang’s passing, he had ordered Zhu Di to exercise control over the military and defend Kaiping. Zhu Di didn’t receive the command to march out from Zhu Yuanzhang, but instead received the news of his death.
Zhu Di started his journey of mourning but returned midway, leaving the people in Beiping puzzled. This action also caused dissatisfaction among Zhu Di’s subordinates. Though they didn’t dare to openly curse Zhu Yunwen, in private, they held deep resentment towards him.
“Your Highness.”
A voice tinged with worldly wisdom startled Zhu Di’s contemplation.
Zhu Di looked up and saw a thin and elderly monk standing at the door, dressed in a black-striped light red kasaya, with his hands folded in prayer.
“Master Daoyan[2]Yao Guangxiao (姚廣孝, 1335–1418), also known by his dharma name Daoyan (道衍), was a Chinese military strategist, statesman and Chan Buddhist monk who lived in … Continue reading, please have a seat.”
Zhu Di quickly stood up, clasped his hands together in a gesture of respect, and arranged, “It must be exhausting to travel back and forth between the mansion and Qingshou Temple in this summer heat. Why not stay in the mansion for a while?”
Master Daoyan expressed his gratitude, saying, “Thank you, Your Highness. However, I have grown accustomed to the tranquility of the meditation hall at the Qingshou Temple. The summer heat is not much of a bother.”
Zhu Di understood and no longer engaged in small talk. He arranged for tea to be served and sat down, sipping the tea gently while contemplating how to broach the subject.
Master Daoyan remained calm and composed, holding a Buddhist prayer bead in one hand, seemingly lost in thought as he quietly observed Zhu Di.
Although Zhu Di was aware of Master Daoyan’s background, he still found it difficult to see through the person before him.
Originally named Yao Guangxiao, he hailed from Changzhou in Suzhou. At the age of fourteen, he entered the monastic life and was given the Dharma name Daoyan.
Despite being a Buddhist practitioner, Dao Yan was not confined to a single school of thought. He was well-versed in Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, and had extensive knowledge in subjects such as astrology, divination, physiognomy, and military strategy.
Their acquaintance began in the fifteenth year of the Hongwu era when Empress Ma passed away. Zhu Yuanzhang ordered the selection of eminent monks to recite scriptures and pray for Empress Ma. The monk Zong Le recommended Dao Yan to serve the king of Yan.
Doa Yan believed Zhu Di possessed the bearing of an emperor, exceptional eloquence, proficiency in both literary and military art, and broad-mindedness, therefore Dao Yan made a firm decision to follow Zhu Di.
Later, Dao Yan arrived in Beiping, and Zhu Di appointed him as the abbot of the Qingshou Monastery, considering him a trusted confidant. They would consult with each other on important matters. After Zhu Di’s unsuccessful attempt to attend the funeral and his return to Beiping, Dao Yan approached him and warned him that the Jianwen Emperor intended to weaken the fiefs and might take action against Zhu Di. He advised Zhu Di to be prepared early, citing the “apprehension of the imperial court,” and also suggested gathering information on the situation.
Zhu Di took Dao Yan’s advice seriously. However, the sudden shift in the court’s direction made it difficult for Zhu Di to ascertain the court’s current attitude.
“Master, have you heard the news from the capital?” Zhu Di broke the silence and asked.
Dao Yan stopped counting the beads on his Buddhist rosary and replied slowly, “I have heard some rumors, but I am unsure of their authenticity.”
Zhu Di let out a sigh and said, “It should be true, but I am uncertain about the court’s stance. I don’t know if this summons is a blessing or a danger.”
Deep in thought, Dao Yan responded, “My Lord, if the court indeed summons you to the capital, in my opinion, it may not necessarily be risky. Perhaps, it could even present an opportunity.”
“Oh?”
Zhu Di’s eyes lit up as he looked at Dao Yan.
Dao Yan explained, “It is widely known in the capital that the Emperor has summoned you and announced the disarmament of 100,000 troops. If this information is true, it sends a message to the world that the Emperor has no intention of curtailing the fiefs—at least not at present.”
Zhu Di gazed at Dao Yan and asked in a deep voice, “Why do you say so?”
Dao Yan replied solemnly, “Firstly if the Emperor intended to forcefully detain the feudal kings who come to the capital for mourning and proceed with curtailing the fiefs, it would instill fear in the hearts of the people and create concerns among the frontier generals. Any slight mishap could lead to mutiny.”
“Secondly, the disarmament of 100,000 troops is not a precursor to curtailing the fiefs. If the Emperor planned to do so, the key would be to weaken the branches while maintaining the core strength. However, the Emperor has not weakened the branches yet but has chosen to weaken the strength first. This indicates his focus on the well-being of the people rather than preparing for curtailing the fiefs.”
“Thirdly, there is no precise news of fief curtailment circulating in the capital. Despite the repeated appeals from Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng, the Emperor remains unmoved. This indicates that the Emperor has not yet made a firm decision.”
“Fourthly, and most importantly, there have been no warnings from your highness former comrades and personnel in the capital. There is no indication of any movement within the capital’s military forces.”
Dao Yan analyzed the situation cautiously.
Zhu Di nodded repeatedly as he listened, but still expressed his concerns and asked, “If the Emperor takes such a risky move and forcefully curtails the fief, what should I do?”
A faint smile appeared at the corner of Dao Yan’s mouth as he said, “If Your Highness goes to the capital and accomplishes a certain task, you will undoubtedly have no worries.”
“Oh? What task?” Zhu Di asked.
Dao Yan spoke slowly, “Make a grand display, rally the support of the citizen and the army.”
Zhu Di fell silent.
Dao Yan’s plan was to bring the hearts of the people and the military to the capital. Once Zhu Di was trapped in the capital, it would inevitably provoke dissatisfaction among the people and the troops in Beiping. At that time, Beiping would descend into complete chaos. And that is something Zhu Yunwen couldn’t bear.
“In that case, I will make another trip to the capital,” Zhu Di made up his mind.
Dao Yan smiled and said, “My lord, there is no need to worry. If you enter the capital, it may present an opportunity. The Five Army Commanders’ Office has many people who are close to you. If we can make some moves and preparations, it may benefit us in the future.”
Zhu Di nodded calmly. After keeping Dao Yan to have a meal, he arranged for someone to escort Dao Yan back to the Qingshou Temple.
As Zhu Di walked through his Mansion, he looked at Ma Sanbao[3]Zheng He (simplified Chinese: 郑和; traditional Chinese: 鄭和; pinyin: Zhènghé; Wade–Giles: Chêng-ho; 1371–1433 or 1435) was a … Continue reading, who was on guard duty, and said, “Prepare yourself. In a couple of days, accompany me to the capital.”
“Understood, my lord,” Ma Sanbao responded solemnly.
The capital city, Imperial Academy.
Xu Miaojin was well aware that being a Chief of Education at Imperial Academy was not an easy task. She would have to endure the criticisms and ridicule of others. Nevertheless, Xu Miaojin accepted the assignment willingly.
Though burdened, it held great significance.
While Xu Miaojin did not know how Zhu Yunwen had managed to quell the turmoil she caused, she respect the customs of the Imperial Academy. She dressed modestly, removing all her jewelry and donning the attire of a refined scholar. With a scholar’s cap on her head, she entered Imperial Academy.
The Chief Scholar of the Imperial Academy, Cheng Shizhou, and the Registrar, Zhang Zhi, received Xu Miaojin’s arrival with calmness. In their eyes, Xu Miaojin was merely a passing guest, a temporary interest of the emperor.
After all, although Xu Miaojin came from a prestigious family and possessed some knowledge, she still had a long way to go, in the Imperial Academy.
If the emperor truly wished to select talent from Imperial Academy, he would not have chosen her.
Rumors had it that Xu Miaojin had begged the emperor for something to do, and out of helplessness, the emperor had agreed to this arrangement.
Upon her arrival, Cheng Shizhou casually exchanged a few words with her and arranged for her to find a place to stay. Afterward, he paid her no further attention. Xu Miaojin was not bothered by this. She understood the principle that if the mountain does not come to you, then you must go to the mountain. She went directly to a hall of record, obtained a list of students at Imperial Academy, and conducted research on their past performances.
Being a student at Imperial Academy allowed for direct appointment to official positions, but life as a student was not easy.
According to the Ming Dynasty regulations, Imperial Academy students had two days off on the first and fifteenth of each month, while the rest of the time was spent either attending classes or self-study. For example, on the second and third of the month, there would be lectures; on the fourth, there would be recitation; on the fifth and sixth, there would be a review of the lectures; on the seventh…
It was either lectures, recitations, or reviews.
Approximately thirteen days of each month were spent on recitation, eight days on the review, and the remaining time was dedicated to self-study, academic assessments, and participating in various activities.
Compared to the scientific education in later times that did not emphasize memorization, Imperial Academy took memorization to the extreme.
Every student had to memorize texts, understand their meanings, and undergo examinations every three days. During each examination, they were required to recite a hundred characters of Edicts, Classics Confucianism Text, and Four books of Confucianism.
Failure to recite accurately resulted in being given ten lashes.
And the lashes were not administered on the palms but on the buttocks…
Each month, there is a requirement to write six essays, two on the interpretation of classics, two on the principles of the Four Books, imperial decrees, memorials, policy discussions, and judicial opinions in the field of internal affairs.
There was no room for slacking off.
The Imperial Academy in the early Ming Dynasty, they were indeed serious about nurturing talent.
However, the majority of students were often labeled as orthodox Confucian scholars, or simply “bookworms.”

Chapter 11: Empire’s Illness, Disloyal Li JingLong?
How Xu Miaojin selects and evaluates talents in the imperial academy is her own matter, and Zhu Yunwen neither wants nor can interfere in it.
Since the establishment of the Grand Secretariat, Zhu Yunwen has finally been able to free himself from countless memorials. Occasionally, he discusses matters with the cabinet ministers and the six ministries, and he appears to be more relaxed.
However, as Zhu Yunwen’s understanding of the Ming Empire deepens, he feels increasingly uneasy. The seemingly prosperous Ming Dynasty is actually like a volcano, and the fundamental problem lies in land occupation and taxation.
Zhu Yuanzhang was cruel in dealing with officials, but he was exceptionally kind to his own family and relatives. He once ordered that his descendants should be supported by the court, meaning that these princes and their descendants didn’t need to work and could rely on imperial provisions at home.
Although Zhu Yuanzhang had good intentions, this rule was seriously flawed. It’s hard to say about other aspects, but one thing is certain, Zhu Yuanzhang was not good at math.
Anyone familiar with “exponential growth” wouldn’t make such a decree.
your Zhu Yuanzhang’s time, how many people were there, and how much food was needed? But have you ever considered that after two hundred years, the descendants of your Zhu family have grown to a population of two hundred thousand? It would cost the court 8.6 million taels of silver annually just to support them. Have you ever looked at the state treasury and how much money is there?
And you stipulated that the descendants of the family don’t have to pay taxes. Fine, you don’t pay taxes, but at least don’t occupy the land. Each king grabs land as if they’re insane, and once they occupy land, they don’t pay any taxes on the output. How does the country sustain itself?
Zhu Yunwen remembers some statistics from the future. The land owned by the vassal kings in Henan during the Ming Dynasty directly occupied one-third of all cultivated land in Henan.
Great, it seems that one-third of the land doesn’t belong to the emperor.
If Zhu Yunwen were to speak, the downfall of the Ming Dynasty is closely related to these seeds of disaster planted by Zhu Yuanzhang.
Everything must be changed!
And it can only be changed during his own era, where the resistance he faces is relatively smaller.
But is it really smaller?
Zhu Yunwen can imagine that those uncles of his will likely attack him on the grounds of “disrespecting ancestral systems,” and these border kings, for their own interests, will inevitably fight back. They are no longer fat pig kings; they are wolves wielding heavy military power.
Not abolishing the fiefs, not reclaiming military power, I can’t even make a move against them!
Zhu Yunwen sighed.
Emperors are not omnipotent.
Zhu Yunwen put down the memorial and said to Shuangxi, “Summon Xie Jin.”
Soon after, Xie Jin entered the Wuying Hall.
Zhu Yunwen picked up a memorial and handed it over, saying, “Read it and give me your response.”
Xie Jin took the memorial and looked at it. This memorial was a secret report from Ge Cheng, the chief secretary of King Yan’s residence. It detailed the scene when Zhu Di was about to enter the capital and leave Beiping Prefecture.
“The common people wailed along the road, and the soldiers wailed endlessly. The direction of people’s hearts is to be feared, truly feared.”
Ge Cheng’s words surprised Xie Jin as well.
“King Yan’s entry into the capital is causing quite a stir.”
Zhu Yunwen sneered and said.
Xie Jin respectfully returned the memorial and quickly said, “Perhaps King Yan is worried…”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Xie Jin, who remained silent, and said, “Worried about what? Worried that I will detain him in the capital? Hah, forget it. Setting aside everything else, just this ability to control people’s hearts, King Yan does it better than me.”
Xie Jin broke out in a cold sweat, deeply alarmed for King Yan, Zhu Di…
The tone of the Emperor was chilling.
It seemed like a murderous intent was brewing.
“Your majesty is the sovereign of a nation, while the King of Yan is merely a vassal king. Although he has been governing Beiping prefecture for nearly twenty years, as long as your majesty gives the order, a large army can quickly capture it,” Xie Jin spoke frankly.
Zhu Yunwen waved his hand, took a deep breath, and said, “The matter regarding vassal kings, I have a way. I summoned you here today for a certain person.”
“Who?”
“The Judge of Five Army Commandery Tie Xuan[1]Tie Xuan (Chinese: 铁铉; 1366–1402),[1] courtesy name Dingshi (鼎石), was born in Dengzhou, Henan during the Yuan dynasty and was … Continue reading.”
“Tie Xuan?”
“Yes, what is your evaluation of him?”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Xie Jin, with a mysterious smile on his lips.
Anyone who has some understanding of the Jingnan Rebellion would surely know the name Tie Xuan. In later generations, especially in various parts of Shandong, there are many temples dedicated to the “Iron Duke,” and the person enshrined there is none other than Tie Xuan of the Ming Dynasty, who brought great trouble to Zhu Di and saved the Jianwen Dynasty from a crisis.
In the Battle of Jinan, he held out against Zhu Di’s forces for three months with a depleted army. Later, Tie Xuan joined forces with Grand General Sheng Yong and pursued the enemy after achieving victory.
As a cabinet minister, Xie Jin naturally had some knowledge of the imperial officials. Upon hearing Zhu Yunwen’s inquiry, he replied, “Is Your Majesty referring to Ding Shi?”
Tie Xuan, with courtesy name Ding Shi, and these two characters were bestowed personally by Zhu Yuanzhang on Tie Xuan.
Seeing Zhu Yunwen nod, Xie Jin continued, “Tie Xuan has a resolute temperament and is intelligent and agile. During the reign of Taizu, he was appointed as a supervising secretary of the Ministry of Rites and worked diligently. He was later transferred to the Commander’s mansion as Judge, he made swift judgments and resolved pending cases. Tie Xuan is highly capable and a pillar of the state.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Xie Jin, realizing that this person had a discerning eye and did not underestimate Tie Xuan due to his current low position.
“Transfer Tie Xuan to the Ministry of War and appointed as Left Deputy Minister.”
Zhu Yunwen issued the order.
Jie Jin quickly accepts.
Zhu Yunwen walked up to a map, looked in the direction of Beiping, and said to Xie Jin, “Our gaze should not only be fixed on the vassal kings. Our Great Ming Empire must become the jewel of the entire world. Come with me, I want to show you guys just how vast this world truly is.”
A fire ignited in Jie Jin’s heart as he looked at Zhu Yunwen with fervent eyes.
Zhu Yunwen laughed and suddenly said, “Arrange for the Ministry of Works to gather craftsmen from Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Huguang, Fujian, and Nanzhili, and have them enter the Longjiang Shipyard. I want a fleet of seafaring ships.”
“Seafaring ships?”
Xie Jin looked at Zhu Yunwen in confusion.
However, Zhu Yunwen did not explain further and simply said, “Go and make the arrangements.”
Jie Jin dared not ask further and could only leave with his doubts.
Zhu Yunwen was well aware of the vastness of the world and knew that Christopher Columbus had not been born yet.
The West enjoys colonization, don’t they?
Let the Great Ming Empire confront them and see who is more formidable, whether it’s them or the Great Ming Empire.
Most importantly, Zhu Yunwen wanted to send people to South America, not for colonization and conquest, but rather for potatoes, peanuts, chili peppers, corn, tomatoes, and tobacco…
And rubber trees as well.
During the early Ming Dynasty, it was unfortunate that these common ingredients and products that are easily found in later times were nonexistent.
Even something as simple as tomato and egg stir-fry was impossible to enjoy.
Smoking? Forget about it.
As for the combination of potatoes with beef, it was probably just a dream.[2]TL’s note: in ancient times, killing cows is against the law.
For food… no, in order to improve resources, alleviate famine, and benefit the Ming Dynasty, it was necessary to establish a fleet.
Zhu Yunwen sat beside his desk, He held a brush and drew on the paper, feeling a bit awkward. But there was no other choice, as pencils did not exist in this era. However, there were chalks available.
“That’s right! A blackboard!” Emperor Zhu Yunjuan suddenly exclaimed.
He called over Shuangxi and instructed, “Go to the Bureau of Works and find some thin wooden boards, A length of about one zhang (approximately 10 feet) and a width of three to four chi (approximately 1-1.3 meters) would be sufficient. Additionally, bring some black lacquer as well.”
After Shuangxi carefully noted the instructions, he quickly went to make the arrangements.
Shortly after, Shuangxi returned with the requested items. Zhu Yunwen instructed Shuangxi and other eunuchs to apply several layers of black lacquer on the wooden boards and let them dry outside. He also had Shuangxi find some chalk, the chalk wasn’t made from lime but from natural white chalk(calcium carbonate).
“Your Majesty, Duke of Wei has arrived,” Shuangxi informed Zhu Yunwen amidst the busy preparations.
I apologize for the mistake. Here is the corrected translation:
Zhu Yunwen nodded, and after Xu Huizu paid his respects, Zhu Yunwen asked, “How is the disarmament proceeding?”
Xu Huizu wore a troubled expression and sighed, “Your Majesty, we have already dismissed five thousand soldiers…”
“Five thousand? Didn’t I tell you to reduce the army by a hundred thousand?” Emperor Zhu Yunwen expressed his dissatisfaction.
Xu Huizu quickly stood up and apologized, saying, “Your Majesty, the disarmament is fraught with difficulties. I dare not act arbitrarily…”
“Do you mean someone has pressured you and prevented the disarmament?” Zhu Yunwen looked at Xu Huizu, who immediately knelt down.
“I have heard that Duke Cao visited the capital army and instigated a group of people to resist the disarmament. Is this information true?”
Zhu Yunwen asked in a soft voice.
Xu Huizu glanced at Zhu Yunwen and couldn’t determine his attitude, so he cautiously replied, “Duke Cao did visit the capital army, but I don’t know if it is related to the resistance against disarmament, Your Majesty.”
“You don’t know, or you dare not say?” Zhu Yunwen looked at Xu Huizu, who gritted his teeth and remained silent. Zhu Yunwen raised his hand and said, “Rise. You are in charge of the central Military Inspectorate. If you cannot handle even such matters properly, it would disappoint me.”
Xu Huizu trembled all over and hurriedly said, “I will do my utmost and not disappoint Your Majesty’s trust!”
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and said solemnly, “You can inform Duke Cao and all the noble officials that the disarmament of one hundred thousand soldiers is my decree. If anyone is dissatisfied, they can come to me and voice their concerns. You just focus on executing the plan. I still trust Duke Wei’s loyalty.”
Xu Huizu looked at Zhu Yunwen, his emotions stirring.
After returning to the Military Inspectorate, Xu Huizu finally felt relieved. Compared to offending these noble colleagues, it was not wise to offend the boss.
Colleagues can be replaced, but bosses are not easily replaced.
Xu Huizu had this realization. As a result, the ambitious plan of military downsizing finally began, and whether it was Duke Cao, other marquises, or royal relatives, anyone who had occupied positions in the military with their servants and subordinates would be eliminated without exception.
In the mansion of King Qiyang, Duke Cao, Li Jinglong, was engaged in bird fighting when a voice came from a distance, “Big brother, Xu Huizhu is challenging us.”
“What’s the matter? talk it out!” Li Jinglong called out to his younger brother, Li Zengzhi, with a frown.
Li Zengzhi approached, stomped his foot in anger, and said, “I just received news that Xu Huizhu has issued an order to dismiss military personnel. The quotas associated with us have been eliminated, and some old generals with connections to our Li family have been expelled from the army.”
Li Jinglong looked at Li Zengzhi, his expression turning serious, and asked, “Did Xu Huizhu really take action?”
Li Zengzhi nodded repeatedly, gritting his teeth as he said, “Big brother if we don’t do anything, who will listen to us?”
“Insolence!” Li Jinglong shouted sternly, looking at the startled Li Zengzhi. He said with seriousness, “The capital Garrison does not belong to us but to the emperor! If the emperor wants to dismiss, let him dismiss.”
“But…”
Li Zengzhi was getting anxious.
Li Jinglong fell silent for a moment, then slowly said, “Is the King of Yan about to arrive in the capital?”

Chapter 12: Your Majesty, is Extraordinary!
Tie Xuan is currently conducting an investigation of military crimes and prisons at the Commander’s Office. Some officials and soldiers, relying on their connections with influential families, have been daring enough to forcibly seize civilian women. It is shocking that such incidents occurred right under the Emperor’s nose, especially during a period of mourning.
If these actions are not met with punishment and severe consequences, they will not be enough to deter others and instill fear in their hearts.
But Tie Xuan was also aware that behind those soldiers stands the second most powerful figure in the military:
Li Jinglong!
Li Jinglong is the son of King Qiyang, Li Wenzhong, and Li Wenzhong is none other than the only nephew of Zhu Yuanzhang. He was even regarded as a son by Zhu Yuanzhang and was renamed Zhu Wenzhong.
Zhu Yuanzhang is Li Jinglong’s grand-uncle, and Zhu Di and other Princes are Li Jinglong’s uncles. Emperor Jianwen, Zhu Yunwen, is Li Jinglong’s cousin. With such influential figures, how can Tie Xuan, a mere fifth-rank official in charge of the commander’s office’s judge, confront them?
But Tie Xuan is unwilling to submit and refuses to yield!
As a result, in the verdict document, tie Xuan issued the order for execution!
Perhaps, not long after, Li Jinglong would send someone to confront him, even arranging for officials to impeach him, leading to a miserable outcome.
But I, Tie Xuan, have a clear conscience!
There was a commotion outside the door, Tie Xuan sat proudly with his back straight, staring towards the entrance.
A messenger named Wan Gui from the Ministry of Personnel entered the room, holding an imperial decree, and shouted, “I bring a decree!”
Tie Xuan quickly stood up and knelt down, followed by the other attendants and personnel in the room.
Some people thought that Tie Xuan was in trouble and secretly rejoiced, but as they listened to the contents of the decree, it seemed to be quite different.
Iron Xuan heard the words “appointed as the left Deputy Minister of the Ministry of War” and was somewhat stunned.
He, a fifth-ranked official, had suddenly become a third-ranked official.
After Wan Gui finished reading the decree, Tie Xuan stood, thanked, and receive the edict with confusion. Wan Gui approached and congratulated him, saying, “Assistant Minister Tie, you have achieved a great leap forward. Congratulations, sir.”
Tie Xuan knew that Wan Gui was seeking favors, so he casually searched and found three taels of silver and gave them to Wan Gui.
Wan Gui’s mouth twitched, but he didn’t want to show disdain. He believed that a mosquito’s meat was also meat, so he accepted the coins with the belief that every little bit counts. Moreover, Tie Xuan was clearly favored, and it wouldn’t look good if things turned sour. After a brief conversation, Wan Gui hurriedly left.
It is worth mentioning that in many TV dramas, eunuchs are often portrayed as delivering imperial edicts, arriving at the residences of officials, and proclaiming phrases like “You’ve been promoted” or “You’re finished.” While it may seem cool and majestic, it was not quite realistic in the Ming Dynasty.
In the Ming Dynasty, there was a specialized department called the “Department of Messengers” (行人司), which was responsible for delivering imperial edicts. Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang had a clear understanding of the role of eunuchs, stating that they were only servants responsible for cleaning and performing specific tasks, without any other appointments or excessive authority.
In short, eunuchs were just household slaves.
Of course, when it comes to announcements within the imperial court, delivering verbal orders from the Emperor, the Emperor delegates eunuchs to deliver the Imperial decrees, and the Department of Messengers is primarily responsible for external affairs.
After his promotion, Tie Xuan naturally needed to report to the Ministry of War. The Minister of War, Ru Chang, welcomed Tie Xuan and engaged in some small talk before arranging for him to enter the palace.
“His Majesty has sent word for you to settle in first then enter the palace,” Ru Huang said, looking pleased.
Ru Huang had great confidence in Tie Xuan’s abilities, especially considering that Tie Xuan was still in his early thirties, at the prime of his youth. His future prospects were promising.
Tie Xuan held a deep respect for Ru Huang. In the early Hongwu reign, Ru Huang served as the right vice Imperial Censor, later acting as the Minister of War, and eventually being officially appointed by Zhu Yuanzhang as the Minister of War due to his outstanding performance.
Tie Xuan showed utmost respect to this “old minister” despite being only forty years old.
“Minister Ru, may I know the reason why his Majesty assigns me to the Ministry of War?”
Tie Xuan was somewhat puzzled.
After all, there were not many officials in the bureaucracy who directly rose to their positions as he did. Most people either had someone recommend them or had the trust of the emperor.
Recommendation?
He don’t personally know the ministers of the Imperial Cabinet, nor was he familiar with the officials of the six ministries. Working at the Commander’s Office, he has offended a group of people, and He believes no one would be willing to recommend him.
A trusted person?
Although He has seen the emperor, the emperor has never seen him.
With so many people in the court, who would care about a low-ranking official like him? he only barely has the qualification to attend court sessions.
Standing outside the main hall, even if he were to take a nap, no one would know.
Ru Chang looked at Tie Xuan and smiled, saying, “Compared to you, I only received the news two hours earlier. I heard that the emperor values you greatly. If you have any doubts, why not speak directly to the emperor?”
“Since that’s the case, I will pay a visit to the emperor. Thank you, Minister Ru.”
Tie Xuan stood up, bowed, and took his leave.
Zhu Yunwen was in a separate room in the Wuying Hall, busy drawing a world map. He had strictly ordered that no one was allowed to enter the room without his permission, at any time.
Shuangxi could only wait outside the door, unaware of what Zhu Yunwen was doing inside.
When Tie Xuan arrived and his presence was announced, Zhu Yunwen finally came out and allowed Tie Xuan to enter. After granting him a seat, Zhu Yunwen smiled and asked, “Minister Tie, do you have any doubts?”
Tie Xuan nodded repeatedly and said, “I am filled with fear and unease, afraid of not living up to Your Majesty’s grace.”
Zhu Yunwen laughed heartily and said, “Nonsense. You will be the future Minister of War, and I have great confidence in your abilities. I have called you here for a specific matter.”
Tie Xuan’s eyebrows lifted, and he felt a surge of excitement in his heart.
Tie Xuan didn’t fully understand the hidden meaning behind “you will be the future Minister of War,” but he sensed that it implied he would be promoted to the position of Minister of War within a few years.
“I humbly ask for Your Majesty’s guidance,” Tie Xuan said.
Zhu Yunwen asked, “You were at the Five Army Commandery, so I presume you are aware of the order to reduce the army by 100,000 soldiers. Do you think there are any flaws in my command?”
Tie Xuan hesitated as he looked at Zhu Yunwen but eventually said, “I believe Your Majesty’s decision has its merits and shortcomings.”
“Hahaha, don’t worry, speak freely. I won’t blame you,” Zhu Yunwen reassured him.
Zhu Yunwen provided Tie Xuan with some reassurance.
Tie Xuan replied solemnly, “Your Majesty, reducing the army by 100,000 soldiers can save a considerable amount of resources and military expenses, benefiting the country. The number of 100,000 may seem significant, but it will not undermine the strength of the capital’s garrison troops. Those soldiers are mostly old, weak, or in unnecessary positions.”
“It seems you understand my intentions. What are the shortcomings, then?” Zhu Yunwen asked.
Tie Xuan spoke frankly, “Reducing the army by 100,000 soldiers will primarily affect the honorable and distinguished figures of the nation. Once they become dissatisfied, it may lead to unrest. Additionally, with the vassal kings stationed outside the capital commanding substantial military forces and guarding the borders, if Your Majesty weakens the garrison troops in the capital, there is a risk that the vassal kings could grow more powerful and pose a threat to the capital, potentially causing significant disturbances.”
“Oh, do you believe the vassal kings will rebel?” Zhu Yunwen asked with great interest.
Tie Xuan fell silent.
This was an important question and a difficult one to answer.
After all, these vassal kings were Zhu Yunwen’s family members. If Tie Xuan said they would rebel, he had no evidence to support his claim, making it mere speculation. How could he convince the Emperor without concrete proof?
But if he said they wouldn’t rebel, Tie Xuan believed that was highly unlikely.
Especially the current King of Yan, Zhu Di, although his ambitions are not yet fully revealed, there are hints to be observed.
By using a posthumous decree to prevent Zhu Di from entering the capital for mourning, it can be inferred that Zhu Yunwen also believed Zhu Di had rebellious intentions.
Tie Xuan sighed and replied solemnly, “Your Majesty, among the Kings, the King of Yan, the King of Ning, and the King of Qin, particularly the King of Yan and the King of Ning, harbor ambitious aspirations. While I dare not assert with certainty, based on my speculation, if no action is taken to curtail their power, it is likely that within two years, the King of Yan will make a move.”
Zhu Yunwen took a deep breath and silently praised:
What a remarkable Tie Xuan!
Following the historical timeline, Zhu Yunwen began the process of reducing the powers of the vassal Kings in August of the 31st year of the Hongwu era. Zhu Di rebelled in the first year of the Jianwen era in June, spanning two years but actually less than a year of time.
Although Tie Xuan was working as a judge in the Five Army Commandery, his vision extended beyond just matters of prisons. He took into account the overall national situation.
Such a person had the foresight of a prime minister!
Zhu Yunwen secretly sighed. In history, Zhu Yunwen was such a fool. He didn’t know how to employ talented officials and only relied on a few bookworms, missing several opportunities to defeat Zhu Di.
If he had entrusted important positions to people like Tie Xuan, Sheng Yong, Ping An, and Xu Huizu, Zhu Yunwen could confidently assert that Zhu Di would never have made it to the capital!
“The reduction of 100.000 troops is only the beginning. The strategy for elite soldiers extends beyond their individual physical abilities. It encompasses their beliefs, military preparations, logistics, and various other aspects. By promoting you to the Ministry of War, I hope you will undertake the crucial responsibility of training new troops in the capital.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Tie Xuan with seriousness.
During the reign of Zhu Yuanzhang, the Five Armies Commandery were established to oversee the military. However, to prevent the Commandery from acquiring excessive power and the commanders from becoming too influential, it was stipulated that although the Five Armies Commandery had the authority to command troops, but they did not possess the power to deploy them.
The power to deploy troops was held by the Emperor alone.
The Ministry of War had the authority to appoint, promote, and train the military but did not have the power to command troops.
Initially, the Five Armies Commandery had significant power, and the Ministry of War was overlooked and deemed insignificant. However, Zhu Yuanzhang made several revisions, aiming to avoid concentrating power in a single office and to ensure that matters were not obstructed. As a result, the power of the Five Armies Commandery was weakened, and certain powers were bestowed upon the Ministry of War.
Although the Five Armies Commandery were inevitably involved in the training of new troops, it was still the Ministry of War that took the leading role.
Tie Xuan finally understood Zhu Yunwen’s intention. He stood up, straightened his posture, and solemnly exclaimed, “I will not disappoint the grace of heaven!”
Zhu Yunwen took a document from the table and handed it to Tie Xuan, saying, “Here is the new strategy I have formulated for the training of new recruits. Study it carefully when you return. I want a comprehensive and viable training plan. You can discuss this matter with the Ministry of War and Duke of Wei.”
After paying his respects, Tie Xuan left and returned to the Ministry of War, placing the document on his desk with a hint of skepticism.
What does the emperor know about training strategies?
Training new troops still requires the collective efforts and brainstorming of the Ministry of War and the Five Armies Commandery. They need to work together to come up with solutions.
After all, it was the emperor’s laborious work. if he didn’t read it, it would be disrespectful to His Majesty’s hard work. Tie Xuan didn’t hold much hope, but when he opened the document and read through it, he suddenly stood up. The more he read, the more serious his expression became. Finally, he slammed the table and exclaimed, “Your Majesty, is Extraordinary!”
Ru chang furrowed his brow, glanced at Tie Xuan, and thought to himself, even if you’re trying to please the emperor, you shouldn’t do it in the Ministry of War’s main hall, right?
To his surprise, Tie Xuan hastily approached, holding the document and handing it to Ru Chang.
Ru chang looked at it, looked again, and suddenly stood up, slamming the table and declaring, “Your Majesty, is extraordinary!”

Chapter 13: The Strategy for New Recruits and the Challenges of Commerce
Strictly speaking, Zhu Yunwen had no understanding of new recruit training in the true sense. However, as the emperor, he didn’t need to be well-versed in the details; that was the responsibility of his ministers. The emperor only needed to provide overarching guidance and coordinate the overall situation.
With the perspective of future generations and drawing from historical knowledge, Zhu Yunwen drafted a comprehensive training plan.
The plan consisted of five parts: physical training, ideological development, battlefield arrangements, equipment upgrades, and special forces development.
It includes a mixture of special forces training methods learned from television and movies, ancient military command strategies on the battlefield, and training methods employed by exceptional ancient commanders, etc.
Naturally, physical fitness is crucial, in the era where cold weapons were predominant, The personal physical fitness, qualities, and combat capabilities of soldiers directly impact the outcome of battles.
Physical strengthening training is essential.
We cannot have soldiers who are out of breath after taking three steps or collapsing after walking ten steps going into battle, can we?
Regarding ideological development, Zhu Yunwen dared not mention anything about communism. After careful consideration, the best approach to instill Marxist-Leninist ideology would result in his own downfall.
As an emperor, it is important to approach it from the perspective of an emperor, respecting objective facts, which is known as a materialist view of history.
Without embracing Marxist-Leninist beliefs, we can promote the heroic spirit of “dying for the cause,” the patriotic spirit of “loyalty to the country,” and the national spirit of “assisting the monarch in governing the nation and maintaining peace throughout the land.”
Supplemented by promotions and rewards benefiting their descendants, it is enough to make soldiers willingly devote themselves to serving the court.
Regarding the arrangement of battle formations, Zhu Yunwen did not elaborate much, as it is the expertise of military commanders. However, he did propose the concept of the “Three Great Camps” and advocated for the practice of new battle formations and tactics.
Equipment upgrade is a matter of great importance to Zhu Yunwen.
Indeed, during the early Ming Dynasty, there were already firearms and ammunition. However, at that time, the long guns were called “huo chong,” and the short guns were called “shou chong.” But these weapons had limited range, ranging from tens of meters to two hundred meters.
Moreover, after firing one shot, they needed to be reloaded before the second shot could be fired, making it difficult to establish a comprehensive firepower network.
With a range of two hundred meters, when facing rapidly approaching cavalry, by the time you have fired two shots, they could already be charging at you with their sabers swinging.
As for cannons, although the “Francois machine” has not yet been introduced to the Ming Dynasty, there were still some cannons available, such as the Shenchong carriage cannon and the Great General cannon.
These cannons were still useful, with longer ranges reaching up to 3 kilometers, and even exceeding 4 kilometers.
However, they were nothing more than a pile of iron, weighing between two hundred to four hundred catties (approximately 100 to 200 kilograms). At that time, the Ming Dynasty did not have trucks or trains for transportation, nor did they have paved roads. After rainfall, the roads would become muddy. Who could transport these heavy cannons?
Furthermore, warfare requires speed, rapid maneuvering, and swift interchanges. If you’re carrying a large cannon, just waiting for it, how many miles can you travel in a day?
Therefore, in the Ming Dynasty, these cannons were mostly used for city defense or, after surrounding enemy cities, brought in to blast open the city gates.
Considering them as an independent branch and integrating them into the battle formation did not exist.
Now, Zhu Yunwen has made it clear that not only does he want to establish musket squads, but he also wants to establish artillery squads, giving them a resounding name: the Artillery Corps.
As for the special forces, Zhu Yunwen’s requirements are even stricter. He demands the selection of four thousand elite soldiers from the four hundred thousand-strong Beijing garrison for special training, truly picking the best of the best.
Minister of War, Ru Huang, looked at the lengthy document of nearly ten thousand characters, his hands trembling slightly. He raised his head and glanced at Tie Xuan, who still wore a look of astonishment and admiration on his face.
“Did the emperor really draft this?”
Ru Huang couldn’t believe it.
If the current emperor possessed such foresight, the Ming Dynasty would flourish in both culture and martial prowess!
A true era of prosperity was on the horizon!
And when that time comes, his name will surely be recorded in the annals of history!
Tie Xuan gradually regained his composure, nodding emphatically. He couldn’t help but exclaim, “The emperor’s actions are undoubtedly feasible. The path to a strong military will be accomplished in our hands. Now I understand, this is the true confidence behind the emperor’s decision to reduce the army by a hundred thousand!”
Ru Huang lowered his head and glanced at the strategy for new recruits, shaking his head slightly. He said, “As the Minister of War for nearly a decade, I have never come across such profound insights. Our emperor first implemented the Cabinet, rectifying the court, and now he is implementing the strategy for new recruits to forge a new army. It seems that our monarch has far-reaching concerns.”
Tie Xuan collected the document and looked at Ru Huang with seriousness, saying, “This matter requires consultation with the Duke of Wei.”
“The Duke of Wei? Only the Duke of Wei?”
Ru Huang was taken aback.
Tie Xuan looked at Ru Huang and suddenly realized the situation.
In theory, although the emperor trusted the Duke of Wei, Xu Huizu, it was not right to completely disregard the Duke of Cao, Li Jinglong. But the emperor had never mentioned Li Jinglong at all.
This meant that Li Jinglong did not have the emperor’s favor.
Tie Xuan frowned slightly and said, “We will follow the Emperor’s orders. As for other matters, they are not within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of War.”
The power struggles within the Five Army Commander’s Office did not extend to the Ministry of War.
Tie Xuan did not want to get involved in them. He only wanted to refine the strategy for the new recruits and train the capital army as soon as possible.
In the Wuying Hall, side hall.
Based on his memory, Zhu Yunwen roughly sketched a world map. Looking at the direction of South America, his gaze then turned towards Europe.
In the 31st year of the Hongwu era, around the year 1398 AD,
Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio had passed away several decades already, but the European Renaissance was still ongoing.
The Hundred Years’ War between England and France was likely still being fought.
Capitalism in Europe was beginning to emerge, and in a few more decades, the Age of Discovery would unfold.
The time left for the Ming Dynasty was not much.
Zhu Yunwen was well aware that if naval power and maritime exploration were not given importance, China would become a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society over four hundred years later. At that time, foreign powers would ravage and exploit the land of China at will.
Zhu Yunwen did not want such a history to repeat itself.
However, embarking on long voyages was not an easy task.
One major factor was the lack of funds.
Zhu Yunwen had visited the imperial treasury, and while it was filled with wealth, it did not belong solely to him.
In fact, many people believed that the imperial treasury was the emperor’s personal property. Strictly speaking, this view was incorrect.
During the reign of Zhu Yuanzhang, the founding emperor, he believed that the whole world belonged to him, so why would he need to set aside private funds?
‘drawing a snake and adding feet to i[1]TL’s note: its Chinese idiom, meaning: spoiling things by doing something unnecessary.
“Emperors consider the world as their own family, and the wealth of the world should be used for the benefit of the world. Why should there be a distinction between public and private? Emperor Taizong of the Song Dynasty also held the same view!” these are Zhu Yuanzhang’s original words.
Zhu Yuanzhang believed that the downfall of the Song Dynasty was related to the imperial family’s establishment of the internal treasury, which used national resources for personal use.
Therefore, during the early Ming Dynasty, the internal treasury was essentially the national treasury.
Although Zhu Yuanzhang implemented the internal treasury system, it lacked effective supervision and management. Additionally, due to Zhu Yuanzhang’s lack of education in economics, there was a tendency to print money without linking it to gold or silver reserves.
By the time of Zhu Yunwen’s reign, the state of the national economy had already deteriorated to some extent.
In the later period, Zhu Yuanzhang also recognized this issue. For example, he made adjustments to officials’ salaries by changing them from salary notes and salary rice to only salary rice.
There was no choice, as paper money was not widely accepted.
Moreover, in the Ming Dynasty, a significant portion of tax revenue came from agricultural taxes, which essentially meant collecting grain as taxes.
During Zhu Yunwen’s reign, having three million taels of silver in the central treasury was considered decent. Of course, if we consider grain as a form of currency, the income would be over ten million taels of silver.
Indeed, a significant portion of the money and grain was allocated to support the military. The military forces of the frontier regions, the capital city, and the local areas all required funding for their maintenance. Additionally, government officials also received salaries.
Especially for the princes and imperial relatives, many of them lacked any real abilities but still received substantial salaries, sometimes even more than the ministers of the cabinet.
With such expenditures, the national treasury would often be depleted by the end of each year.
Zhu Yunwen sighed, realizing that if they were given a few more years of peaceful development, the economy of the Ming Dynasty could improve. However, in the current situation, could true peace be achieved?
As for Zhu Di, the formidable figure, would he choose to resist to the end or submit?
This was something Zhu Yunwen couldn’t determine.
“Industry and commerce,” Zhu Yunwen murmured to himself. If they couldn’t lift the restrictions on industry and commerce, relying solely on the agricultural output of the peasants to make Ming Dynasty prosperous would be almost impossible.
However, in the Ming Dynasty, there were no merchants.
Zhu Yuanzhang had a strong hatred for merchants and even issued the command “Those who do not engage in production can be captured and killed.” It can be said that among the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, the Ming Dynasty had the lowest status for merchants.
This may be related to Zhu Yuanzhang’s background. Additionally, his family members were harmed by unscrupulous merchants, which further fueled his belief that merchants were as detestable as corrupt officials and needed to be severely suppressed.
During the early Ming Dynasty, there were only official statuses for soldiers, farmers, and craftsmen. The concept of a merchant class simply did not exist.
The policy of “focusing on agriculture and suppressing commerce” became a fundamental state policy for Zhu Yuanzhang.
The biggest challenge in changing this policy is not Zhu Yuanzhang who already rests in the Xiaoling Mausoleum, but rather the deeply ingrained Confucian ideology of “focusing on agriculture and suppressing commerce.”
Government officials preferred stability and the development of the agricultural economy.
As for merchants? Today they are in the capital, tomorrow in the northern part, and the day after tomorrow they might be doing business at sea. How can we possibly manage them?
They should stay rooted in the land, tightly controlled and managed, shouldn’t they?
Moreover, if merchants continue to accumulate wealth, it will result in a concentration of riches, leading to a shortage of wealth in the country. How can the common people survive?
Perhaps these were the sentiments of officials during that era.
However, history has proven that outdated systems cannot restrain the mighty force of economic laws.
Ming Dynasty merchants found ways to navigate through these restrictions. For example, they would affiliate themselves with certain registered statuses. They would first buy a piece of land and make it clear that they were farmers, merely engaged in agricultural activities. But as for why they engaged in business, should they not be allowed to pursue additional sources of income?
If that was not feasible, they would collaborate with military households and assume military status. They would have their son or nephew join the army on their behalf. He was soldier, who dare to interfere with his business?
These merchant collectives, disguised under different identities, became significant drivers of the Ming Dynasty’s economy.
They still carried heavy shackles on them, indeed.
Zhu Yunwen understood that merchants needed to be legalized, as it was the key to unleashing the market’s potential.
As for how this fierce bull of commerce would move, it would depend on how it was guided.
However, now was not the right time, because Zhu Di was about to enter the capital.

Chapter 14: Great Ming Security Bureau.
Reforms are never an overnight process. Zhu Yunwen was familiar with Marxist-Leninist principles and understood the importance of “seeking truth from facts.” Simply transplanting the experiences and mindset of future generations to the Ming dynasty would only result in resistance and an unsatisfactory outcome.
For now, setting aside commercial matters, the construction of the court was of utmost importance. Despite the apparent stability of the court, hidden currents were constantly surging, and a significant portion of these undercurrents originated from the influential nobility groups.
These noble factions were often composed of the second generation of the nobility, exerting considerable influence within the court.
Unfortunately, the majority of the first-generation nobility were essentially exterminated by Zhu Yuanzhang, and only a few managed to survive. Tang He, the Duke of Xinguo, survived, but he passed away from illness three years ago.
Geng Bingwen, the Marquis of Changxing, is still alive, but he is already sixty-four years old and primarily a skilled defensive general. While his loyalty is not a major concern, his age makes him unfit for the rigors of battle and unable to deter the ambitions of the younger generation.
For the past few days, Zhu Yunwen has been studying the reform of the Five Army Commandery. Without transforming the military structure, it will be difficult to realize the dream of a strong army.
The dilemma of having commanders who lack military knowledge and soldiers who do not recognize their leaders greatly undermines the combat effectiveness of the army.
Zhu Yunwen’s gaze is fixed on the position of the Left Army Commandery in the organizational chart, where there is a name: Li Jinglong.
Zhu Yunwen despises Li Jinglong because, in history, Li Jinglong was a complete imbecile and traitor.
During the Jingnan Rebellion, Emperor Jianwen appointed Li Jinglong as the Grand General and entrusted him with leading a force of five hundred thousand troops to attack the nine gates of Beiping. As Commander Qü Neng was about to breach the Zhangye Gate, Li Jinglong, fearing that Qü Neng would steal the credit, ordered a retreat, resulting in a defeat.
Later in the Battle of Baigou River, Li Jinglong suffered a major defeat, abandoning all his troops, and fleeing back alone to Nanjing.
Not to mention, during Zhu Di’s assault on Nanjing, Li Jinglong acted as a treacherous traitor and, together with the King of Gu, Zhu Hui, opened the Jinchuan Gate of Nanjing, allowing Zhu Di to easily conquer the city.
Zhu Yunwen is well aware of this period in history.
Although Li Jinglong had not betrayed Zhu Yunwen at this time, Zhu Yunwen did not like him at all for being a fool, an idiot, and a potential traitor.
If Zhu Yunwen had not just ascended to the throne and reigned for a short period, he might have even considered killing Li Jinglong.
Shuangxi knocked on the door.
Zhu Yunwen walked out of the side hall, and Shuangxi respectfully handed him a memorial, saying softly, “Your Majesty, Duke of Wei has sent a confidential report.”
Zhu Yunwen opened the confidential report and read it carefully. When he came across the words “Front Army Left Commander Li Zengzhi has left the city and headed straight to Yangzhou Prefecture,” his gaze slightly hardened, emanating a chilling aura.
“Where is the King of Yan?” Zhu Yunwen asked.
Shuangxi quickly replied, “He has passed Huai’an and should be approaching Gaoyou soon.”
Just south of Gaoyou[1]Gaoyou (simplified Chinese: 高邮; traditional Chinese: 高郵; pinyin: Gāoyóu), is a county-level city under the administration … Continue reading is Yangzhou Prefecture.
A cold smile crept onto Zhu Yunwen’s lips. He hadn’t even had the chance to meet Zhu Di yet, and these military officials and nobles had already taken the initiative to make contact. Did they really think he was blind?
Li Zengzhi was nothing to worry about, but behind him stood Li Jinglong, who held considerable power.
Indeed, the influence of Li Wenzhong still lingers, and there are close connections between Li Jinglong and Li Wenzhong’s former subordinates. Moreover, Li Jinglong holds the title of Marquis of Cao. Unless he commits a significant offense, it won’t be easy to take action against him.
As an emperor, one must consider methods, reasons, and implications before making decisions. It’s not as simple as speaking a few words to resolve a person’s fate.
As powerful as Zhu Yuanzhang was, he still came up with a pile of excuses when he killed Hu Weiyong.
After careful consideration, Zhu Yunwen burned the confidential report and said to Shuangxi, “Some people’s appetites are never satisfied. They always want to eat more without considering whether their stomachs can digest it all.”
Shuangxi lowered his head, not daring to speak.
“Never mind, let them be. What are those Kings and princes in the capital busy with?” Zhu Yunwen asked.
Shuangxi quickly responded, “Your Majesty, the princes haven’t been particularly active these days, although Prince Gaoyang, Zhu Gaoxu, has been a bit more conspicuous. He has been seen frequenting some entertainment venues with Li Zengzhi.”
“Heh, unable to withstand a little loneliness even during the mourning period. It seems that Zhu Gaoxu also has his shortcomings…” Zhu Yunchuan chuckled lightly.
If a person cannot even control their own desires, their achievements will inevitably not last long.
Achieving greatness requires willpower, wisdom, capability, and also self-discipline, knowing what one should and should not do!
“But…”
Shuangxi hesitated.
“But what?”
Zhu Yunwen asked.
Shuangxi quickly knelt and said, “Your Majesty, it’s just a rumor I heard…”
“Speak up, I won’t blame you,” Zhu Yunwen reassured.
Shuangxi said, “Your Majesty, I have heard that the King of Ning has a close interaction with the Duke of Cao, and they have been getting drunk together in the King of Qiyang’s residence in recent days. However, I cannot confirm the truth of these rumors.”
Zhu Yunwen chuckled and asked, “What else have you heard?”
Shuangxi said with unease, “I have also heard that the King of Ning is skilled at making connections and has close ties with influential military figures…”
Zhu Yunwen waved his hand and said, “Investigate who told you this information and apprehend them for interrogation.”
“Ah?”
Shuangxi looked at Zhu Yunwen in surprise.
Zhu Yunwen looked at Shuangxi with a somewhat cold gaze and said, “You are my eyes and ears. What you hear and see is often what others want you to hear and see. Go and investigate. Someone wants to divert my attention to the King of Ning. Find out who is so clever!”
Shuangxi broke out in a cold sweat and remained kneeling.
“It seems that it’s time to reinstate the Jinyiwei (Embroidered Uniform Guard)[2]The Embroidered Uniform Guard (traditional Chinese: 錦衣衞; simplified Chinese: 锦衣卫; pinyin: Jǐnyīwèi; lit. ‘brocade-clad guard’) … Continue reading,” Zhu Yunwen sighed inwardly.
He cannot rely solely on the Five Military Commandery or the Grand Secretariat to know everything. These individuals all have their own personal interests and networks. If someone deliberately conceals information, he would only be a deaf and blind person sitting in the depths of the palace.
The Jinyiwei was created by Zhu Yuanzhang. It was originally known as the Gongwei(Guarding and Escort) Bureau, later transformed into the Imperial Guards office, overseeing the emperor’s ceremonial guards and attendants. In the fifteenth year of the Hongwu reign, Zhu Yuanzhang disbanded the Office of Imperial Guards and reestablished it as the Jinyiwei.
During the early Ming dynasty, The main authority of the Jinyiwei was to be responsible for the direct escorting of the emperor, performing guard duties, and conducting patrols and apprehensions, They were directly responsible to the Emperor. The Jinyiwei had the power to arrest any individuals, including members of the imperial family and high-ranking officials,. Furthermore, they had the ability to conduct interrogations without the involvement of the three judicial offices.
During the Hongwu era, the Jinyiwei dressed in “flying fish” uniforms, was a nightmare for many ministers.
A Sentence in “Ming History, Study of Law”, proves the terrifying nature of the Jinyiwei: “Case of Hu Weiyong, Lan Yu, Implicated and persecuted up to forty thousand people.”
This kind of mass persecution was largely a result of the actions carried out by the Jinyiwei, and of course, it was related to the paranoid nature of Zhu Yuanzhang and his tacit approval.
In the twentieth year of the Hongwu era, Zhu Yuanzhang abolished the Jinyiwei. However, after Zhu Di ascended to the throne, the Jinyiwei was reinstated and, along with the notorious “Eastern Depot,” became one of the most feared organizations in the Ming Dynasty.
Zhu Yunwen was well aware that the ministers would undoubtedly oppose the reinstatement of the Jinyiwei. They were weary and afraid of those dark and oppressive days. However, Zhu Yunwen also refused to be without obedient ears and eyes.
Relying solely on the Five Military Commandery, Grand Secretariat, and the Imperial Censor, it is highly likely that other voices may not be heard.
Zhu Yunwen doesn’t advocate violence, but he needs an institution similar to the Jinyiwei to gather information and provide more detailed intelligence for him.
In consideration of the significant resistance faced in directly restoring the Jin Yi Wei, Zhu Yunwen decided to establish a new department under his direct control, responsible for various intelligence investigations within the Ming Empire. This department will be named the “Great Ming Security Bureau(大明安全局).”
Zhu Yunwen establishes the Great Ming Security Bureau, It’s only a reorganization of the emperor’s personal guard and its application. This does not require approval from the Grand Secretariat and the Six Ministries. However, to prevent panic among the Grand Secretariat and court officials, Zhu Yunwen issues a decree with the following general idea:
The Great Ming Security Bureau is primarily responsible for Combatting actions that pose a threat to the security of the Ming Dynasty, Engaging in covert operations against enemies, Safeguarding national security, and Maintaining social and political stability.
As for gathering intelligence, investigating military situations, and gathering information, these activities are also carried out in the interest of the security of the Ming Dynasty.
To prevent the excessive power and arbitrary actions of the Great Ming Security Bureau, Zhu Yunwen issued an order stating that the bureau is not allowed to arrest, detain, or interrogate any government officials without his or the Grand Secretariat’s permission.
In other words, the Great Ming Security Bureau has the authority to conduct investigations and take action, but it does not have the power to arrest or interrogate individuals. If the need for interrogation arises, it must be done in collaboration with the Three Judicial Offices. The bureau cannot independently carry out interrogations
Compared to the Jinyiwei, the Great Ming Security Bureau has indeed had its fangs removed.
Even if the Grand Secretariat wanted to oppose, they couldn’t voice their opposition. Some officials in the court expressed concerns and were preparing to submit memorials to voice their opposition. However, before the memorials could be submitted, they were confiscated by the Grand Secretariat and they might even be destroyed tomorrow.
The Emperor has given face to the Grand Secretariat and the central government. The Grand Secretariat and the central government also need to take care of the Emperor’s dignity, don’t they?
Even Fang Xiaoru, who advocated civil governance, did not utter a word of dissent regarding the establishment of the Great Ming Security Bureau.
In essence, the Great Ming Security Bureau and Jinyiwei are not different; both are independent intelligence and security agencies responsible to the Emperor.
But in terms of characteristics, Jinyiwei was like a wild and untamed wolf that would pounce on anyone it saw, relentlessly biting and attacking. It would continue biting one person after another. On the other hand, the Great Ming Security Bureau is different. It is more like a horse held by a rein. While it can neigh and run freely, it ultimately will not bite anyone.
Fang Xiaoru does not oppose the existence of such an institution because he understands it is a means for the emperor to maintain his rule.
If the higher-ups do not speak up, the voices of those below will be futile.
On the tenth day of July in the thirty-first year of the Hongwu era, Zhu Yunwen issued a clear decree to establish the Great Ming Security Bureau.
The Great Ming Security Bureau stepped onto the stage of Ming history, becoming a blunt yet formidable sword in the hands of Zhu Yunwen. Though it may not appear sharp, it is unstoppable!
On July 16th, outside the city of Yangzhou.
Zhu Di looked at Li Zengzhi, who was approaching from a distance. With a smile on his face, he turned to Qiu Fu beside him and said, “These people still have their uses.”
Qiu Fu glanced at Li Zengzhi and smiled, saying, “Your Highness’s words are absolutely right.”
As they approached closer, Li Zengzhi dismounted from his horse and shouted loudly, “Li Zengzhi, the Left Commander of the Front Army, pays respects to the King of Yan.”
Zhu Di quickly dismounted and called out, “Commander Li, please rise quickly. After traveling for over a month, it is comforting to see family here in Yangzhou Prefecture.”
Li Zengzhi, seeing Zhu Di’s approachable demeanor and referring to him as family, couldn’t help but smile. He quickly extended his invitation, saying, “Uncle, I have made arrangements in the city. Please come with me and take some rest before continuing your journey to the capital.”

Chapter 15: Zhu Yunwen’s Transfer Order
Li Zengzhi is the second son of the King of Qiyang, Li Wenzhong, and Li Wenzhong is also a nephew of Zhu Yuanzhang. From this family relationship, Li Wenzhong and Zhu Di can be considered first cousins.
Therefore, Li Jinglong and Li Zengzhi need to address Zhu Di as their paternal uncle.
In his youth, Zhu Di studied warfare under the guidance of Li Wenzhong, establishing a close relationship with both Li Jinglong and Li Zengzhi.
Now, Zhu Di is traveling from Beiping to the capital, Jinling[1]TL’s note: The Capital of the Ming dynasty in the early era is Nanjing or Jinling, and encountering “family” in the city of Yangzhou naturally brings him joy. In addition, Li Zengzhi, being competent and efficient, makes arrangements for Zhu Di and his entourage to enter Yangzhou, He directly rented an entire tavern and ordered soldiers to guard it, prohibiting anyone from approaching.
After three rounds of drinking, Li Zengzhi dismisses those around him, and Zhu Di remains calm, raising his hand to signal Qiu Fu and others to also leave the room.
Seeing that there were only themselves in the room, Li Zengzhi felt relieved. He raised his cup and toasted Zhu Di, saying, “Uncle, we are family, so there’s no need for formalities.”
Zhu Di nodded silently.
Li Zengzhi asked in a low voice, “Uncle, to be honest with you, the emperor’s intentions are hard to decipher, some time ago, he established Grand Secretariat, introduced a new military policy, and just recently established the Great Ming Security Bureau. Both the court and the people are filled with anxiety.”
“Oh? What happened?” Zhu Di looked at Li Zengzhi and asked.
Regarding Zhu Yunwen’s methods, Zhu Di has heard about them and supports them.
Even if he ascends to the throne, it is necessary to have a group of capable individuals to handle important tasks on his behalf. Otherwise, the emperor would have to directly manage the court, and review every matter, and it would be exhausting and burdensome.
Zhu Di considers the establishment of the Grand Secretariat to be a brilliant strategy.
As for the military reforms and the establishment of the Great Ming Security Bureau, Zhu Di finds them acceptable and does not believe that these measures would cause widespread anxiety among the people.
Li Zengzhi sighed and said, “Nowadays, the central power of the court is concentrated in the Six Ministries and the Grand Secretariat. Officials can only see the emperor twice a month, and even if they submit memorials or impeach someone, they may be detained by the Grand Secretariat. If this continues, the sovereignty of the Ming Dynasty will become the sovereignty of the Grand Secretariat.”
Zhu Di calmly sipped his wine.
Zhu Di was well aware of the extent of power held by the Grand Secretariat. He considered Li Zengzhi’s words to be exaggerated.
Li Zengzhi continued, “The implementation of the New Military Policy requires the reduction of 100,000 soldiers, and among these 100,000, many of them are from our noble ranks. Especially some of the commanding officers in the guards who have close ties with us, they have been stripped of their official positions and forced to leave the capital garrison along with their comrades.”
“These comrades have come to our doorstep. Should we intervene or not? If we intervene, we can’t manage all of them, and we can’t go against the emperor’s will. If we don’t intervene, how can we bear to see them wandering the streets as former comrades?”
“The emperor is only focused on implementing the New Military Policy, but it has shaken the foundation of the capital garrison. It is a sign of chaos. Moreover, this Great Ming Security Bureau is clearly just another name for the Jinyiwei. It hasn’t been long since the emperor took over the reins of power, yet he has already violated the intentions of the founding emperor by reinstating the Jinyiwei. It seems that the emperor hasn’t truly grasped the governing strategies of the founding emperor.”
Zhu Di looked at Li Zengzhi and the words “lack of understanding of the founding emperor’s governing strategies” flashed through his mind like a bolt of lightning.
This is a perfect reason!
The founding emperor abolished the position of Chancellor, and Zhu Yunwen established the Grand Secretariat as a replacement.
The founding emperor expanded the capital guards, and Zhu Yunwen downsized them.
The founding emperor abolished the Jinyiwei, and Zhu Yunwen established the Great Ming Security Bureau.
Based on Zhu Yunwen’s recent actions, his style of governance and methods are clearly contrary to those of the founding emperor!
If we use the pretext of “disrespecting the founding emperor and deviating from his governing strategies” to prove that Zhu Yunwen is not a qualified successor to the empire, then when the time comes to raise an army, we can proclaim the slogan of “upholding the founding principles and restoring ancestral systems.” We will let the world know that I, Zhu Di, am the true rightful heir who best understands and can grasp the founding emperor’s governing strategies!
Li Zengzhi noticed the gleam in Zhu Di’s eyes, the unspoken desire he held. He lightly tapped his finger on the table and said, “Uncle, we are family.”
Li Zengzhi deliberately emphasized the word “we,” speaking slowly and exchanging meaningful glances, conveying a hidden meaning.
Zhu Di, being an intelligent person, understands the underlying message in Li Zengzhi’s words.
Li Zengzhi was telling Zhu Di that if Zhu Di had the intention, they would be his strength to help him achieve greatness.
Zhu Di put down his wine cup and chuckled, “The recent days of traveling have indeed made me weary. Drinking too much now seems to overwhelm me.”
“Changing the wine is not difficult at all. It only requires…” Li Zengzhi raised an eyebrow, picked up a nearby wine jug, and casually poured it onto the ground. He looked at Zhu Di and slowly said, “Since the wine is spilled, we can only bring in new wine.”
Zhu Di narrowed his eyes, listening to the sound of the wine spilling onto the ground, which seemed to resemble the neighing of a thousand horses. He composed himself and said, “When the wine is spilled, there are always people who will set it right.”
Li Zengzhi stared at Zhu Di and softly asked, “Under the blade of the founding emperor, many souls perished, but the King of Yan stands unchallenged.”
Zhu Di took the wine jug from Li Zengzhi, poured himself a cup, and drank it in one gulp. He said, “I wonder if the wind is strong in the capital. If the weather is good, I’d like to take a walk on Purple Mountain[2]Purple Mountain or Zijin Shan (Chinese: 紫金山; pinyin: Zǐjīn Shān; lit. ‘Purple-Gold Mountain’) is located on the eastern side … Continue reading.”
Li Zengzhi nodded solemnly and said, “Your Highness, I’m sure everything will go as you wish.”
After this conversation, Li Zengzhi understood Zhu Di’s thoughts. Zhu Di wasn’t without thought of betrayal, but he had yet to make up his mind. On one hand, he worried about the imperial army besieging him, and on the other hand, he feared that Zhu Yunwen would suddenly act against him in the capital.
However, thanks to Zhu Yuanzhang, Most of the founding heroes of the Ming Dynasty, especially the military commanders, have been largely exterminated. Among the few remaining leaders capable of commanding the army in Ming, there were only a handful, including the King of Yan Zhu Di and the King of Ning Zhu Quan.
And the other, Li Zengzhi, around Ming Dynasty, was just mediocre.
Zhu Di understood Li Zengzhi’s words and recognized them as an opportunity. However, he was well aware that along with opportunities came great challenges.
Zhu Yunwen was the emperor, and he had the power to mobilize the entire nation’s forces to besiege Zhu Di. The military strength at his disposal was not limited to a mere million troops.
Also, Zhu Yunwen is in Nanjing, his own army is in Beiping, separated by over two thousand miles. Even if Zhu Yunwen doesn’t send a single soldier, it would still take him at least a month to travel there, and if we consider logistics and supplies, it could take several months.
Even if Zhu Yunwen lacks capable generals, his vast army is enough to make Zhu Di extremely cautious. He needs to carefully consider his options and think twice. If Zhu Yunwen becomes ruthless or if he makes a wrong decision, he could easily be eliminated.
Zhu Di doesn’t want to die.
Rebellion comes with great rewards, but they also come with great risks.
If successful, He could reign over the world.
If unsuccessful, He could meet his demise.
After seeing Zhu Di off to rest, Li Zengzhi bids farewell at the door with a smile, saying, “Uncle, we’ll meet again in the capital.”
Zhu Di in a somewhat drunken state, lies on his bed, contemplating his next move.
The distance between Yangzhou Prefecture and the capital is less than 200 miles. If traveling on horseback, one can reach the capital tomorrow evening. Zhu Di is curious about how Zhu Yunwen will act in this situation.
But the current Zhu Yunwen seems different from the Zhu Yunwen he used to know.
He no longer appears as the benevolent and hesitating person he once was. Instead, he possesses a decisive and ruthless determination, as well as a decisive power of strategic thinking.
What surprises Zhu Di, even more, is that his nephew, Zhu Yunwen, seems to have great insights and exhibits the qualities of a wise ruler when it comes to governing the country.
Unable to unravel his own confusion, Zhu Di can only fall into a drowsy sleep while contemplating.
In the magnificent palace illuminated by bright lights, Zhu Yunwen is listening to the report of Liu Changge, the first commander of the Great Ming Security Bureau.
Liu Changge rose from humble beginnings and experienced several major battles. He showed great bravery during the “Desert Expedition” led by Lan Yu and was later selected by Zhu Yuanzhang to join the Imperial Guards.
This obscure figure in history, whose name cannot be found, ascended to the historical stage because Zhu Yunwen and become head of the Great Ming Security Bureau—the Commanding Officer.
Zhu Yunwen chose Liu Changge not only for his unquestionable loyalty but also for his exceptional abilities. He had a keen understanding of written texts and was highly strategic in his thinking.
He had a remarkable perceptiveness, able to discern the smallest details and predict the outcome of events based on subtle indications.
This is Zhu Yunwen’s assessment of Liu Changge.
Since the establishment of the Great Ming Security Bureau, Liu Changge has devoted himself wholeheartedly. Within a short week, he has selected three thousand skilled individuals from the imperial guards and deployed them both inside and outside the capital to gather intelligence and investigate matters.
Liu Changge reported to Zhu Yunwen, saying, “Li Zengzhi had a secret conversation with the King of Yan for two hours. However, we were unable to ascertain the specific details.”
Zhu Yunwen pondered for a moment and said, “Even if you treat someone well if they harbor ulterior motives, they won’t appreciate it.”
Liu Changge dared not say another word.
Zhu Yunwen smiled lightly and said, “You may leave for now.”
Liu Changge bowed and withdrew.
After contemplating for a while, Zhu Yunwen turned to Shuangxi, who stood by with lowered hands and said, “Instruct the Grand Secretariat to draft an imperial decree appointing Zhang Bing as Beiping’s chief secretary. Ping’an and Sheng Yong as the Commanders of Beiping, with Ping’an in charge of defense affairs in Beiping. Transfer Qu Neng and Xu Kai, the Commanders of Sichuan, to station their troops at Shanhai Pass [3]Shanhai Pass or Shanhaiguan (simplified Chinese: 山海关; traditional Chinese: 山海關; pinyin: Shānhǎi Guān) is one of the major passes in … Continue reading, Kaiping[4]Kaiping (Chinese: 开平), alternately romanized in Cantonese as Hoiping,[a] is a county-level city in Guangdong Province, China.

“Tell Ping’an, Sheng Yong, Qu Neng, and others to treat the soldiers well and ensure that the army obeys the orders of the court. If anyone disobeys, they can enforce military law! Reassign the commanding officers as necessary, and I grant them the authority!”
Shuangxi solemnly remembered these instructions in his mind and hurried to the Grand Secretariat.
On that night, Xie Jin presided over the Grand Secretariat and heard the emperor’s orders, which, though unexpected, were within his expectations.
King of Yan Zhu Di had always been the emperor’s focal point.
Without a doubt!
Xie Jin couldn’t quite grasp Emperor Zhu Yunwen’s intentions. It seemed that the emperor was confident that the other princes wouldn’t pose a threat and focused his attention solely on Zhu Di. However, considering the current situation, it was indeed Zhu Di who posed the greatest threat among the kings.
Xie Jin drafted the edict, and Zhu Yunwen used the imperial seal to validate it. The General Secretariat promptly transmitted the orders throughout the night.
Zhu Yunwen decided to make a preemptive move and observe Zhu Di’s reaction.
Ping An, Sheng Yong, and Qu Neng are all outstanding military commanders who emerged during the Jingnan Rebellion. Zhu Yunwen dispatched all three of them to the north, specifically to keep an eye on Zhu Di, he believe Zhu Di understand what this military threat means.
On the evening of July 17th, Zhu Di arrived at the outskirts of the capital city, but instead of entering the city, he chose to rest outside for the night.
The next morning, Zhu Di’s carriage crossed the river and arrived at the Sanshanmen Wharf. Instead of appearing proud and arrogant, he was dressed in white and wept bitterly, calling out loudly, “Father, your son has come late.”

Chapter 16: The First Confrontation with Zhu Di
Zhu Yunwen sat in the Wuying Hall, accompanied by Grand Secretary Yu Xin and Zhang Dan, Xie Jin, and Fang Xiaoru. Liu Changge, the commander of the Great Ming Security Bureau, constantly reported to Zhu Yunwen about the activities of Zhu Di after his entry into the city.
Zhu Di did not return to his residence in the capital city. Instead, he moved through Jinling City, wailing as if in a funeral procession. Perhaps feeling that his own voice was too faint and easily broken, Zhu Di had his three sons join him in crying.
Zhu Di had previously embarked on expeditions to Mongolia, which had significantly raised his fame. Coupled with the big commotion of his arrival, as he made his way through the cities, people in the city, regardless of age, eagerly hoped to catch a glimpse of the King of Yan’s elegance.
What kind of elegance can a weeping King of Yan possess?
It merely evoked silent sympathy from the people in the city.
After all, a son arrives late to mourn his departed father.
Whose fault is it?
It is the fault of the Emperor!
Have you not heard that the King of Yan was intercepted at Huai’an on his way to mourn?
Otherwise, could the King of Yan have arrived so late?
It’s just that no one dares to directly say that the Emperor made a mistake.
In ancient times, it was believed that the Emperor could do no wrong.
Anyone who dared to criticize the Emperor would face consequences once it was known by the imperial court. They could be scolded or even killed.
Zhu Di indulged himself in acting to his heart’s content. His voice grew hoarse from shouting, his stomach became empty, and his mouth felt dry and parched. Unable to continue his performance, he led his entourage out of the city through the Jubao Gate[1]The Zhonghua Gate (traditional Chinese: 中華門; simplified Chinese: 中华门; pinyin: Zhōnghuámén), previously Jubao Gate (聚宝门)is a gate and defensive complex on … Continue reading and went to Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum.

Ming Xiaoling mausoleum is located at the southern foot of Purple Mountain, and … Continue reading
He wailed at Xiaoling throughout the afternoon until it grew dark before returning to the city.
It is said that Zhu Di cried until he fainted, but it is unclear whether it was due to exhaustion from acting or if he accidentally fell asleep.
Liu Changge reported Zhu Di’s activities, as well as the activities of people and vassal kings in the city to Zhu Yunwen. Zhu Yunwen, however, remained calm and listened attentively. Zhu Yunwen even invited the three cabinet ministers and Fang Xiaoru to have lunch and dinner. However, their discussions were not about Zhu Di but rather focused on the issue of taxation in Jiangnan[3]Jiangnan, also romanized as Kiangnan, Chiang-nan, and Jiang Nan, is a geographic area in China referring to lands immediately to the south of lower reaches of … Continue reading.

Zhu Yuanzhang is known for his vengeful nature, after becoming the Emperor, he reduced and exempted taxes in many regions to revive production. However, only the Jiangzhe region had its taxes increased several-fold.
Not only that, but Zhu Yuanzhang also issued an edict prohibiting individuals from Jiangzhe regions from holding positions in the Ministry of Revenue. He even included this provision in the “Imperial Ming Ancestral Instructions” to ensure that future generations would abide by it.
“Excessive taxation in Jiangzhe” was indeed a pressing issue that Zhu Yunwen had to address.
In Zhu Yunwen’s view, the Jiangzhe regions had always been prosperous since the old times, with a history of wealth, prominent merchants, and thriving cultural and educational development. These regions were crucial for his vision of establishing a grand commercial empire in the future.
A Jiangzhe region stifled by oppressive taxation would lack the means and conditions to foster a prosperous business landscape. What’s more concerning is that excessive taxation can significantly dampen productivity and hinder economic growth.
If everyone refrains from productive activities, it can lead to social instability. Zhu Yunwen needs a stable and prosperous Jiangzhe region.
Yu Xin, Zhang Dan, and Jian Jin all support the reform of taxation in Jiangnan, even if it means breaking away from the principles outlined in the “Imperial Ming Ancestral Instructions.”
Similarly, Fang Xiaoru also supports the reform and emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the welfare of the people. He even quotes Zhu Yuanzhang’s words, “Rest the people and accumulate resources; this is how life and livelihood are sustained.” Fang Xiaoru advocates for lighter burdens and lower taxes.
Zhu Yunwen agrees with their opinions and is about to issue an edict. However, Fang Xiaoru adds, “Your Majesty, according to the ‘Rites of Zhou,’ the implementation of the well-field system in the Jiangzhe regions can enhance the national strength.”
“well-field system?”
Zhu Yunwen’s teeth began to ache slightly.
The well-field system is from the slave society period, implemented during the Shang Dynasty, prevalent during the Western Zhou Dynasty, disintegrated during the Spring and Autumn Period, and abolished during the Warring States Period.
A system that has already been abandoned by the times, and yet you still want to bring it back and use it?
Although the well-field system adopted a system of state ownership, where the emperor granted land to nobles and officials who would then have slaves work on the land, the land was not allowed to be bought, sold, or transferred. This system allowed the nobility to reap the benefits.
Such a system restricted productivity and has been discarded by the passage of time.
He didn’t expect that Fang Xiaoru would actually want to revive it?
Zhu Yunwen was well aware that all of Fang Xiaoru’s actions, thoughts, and methods stemmed from the “Rites of Zhou.” He found Fang Xiaoru to be overly idealistic.
“Mr. Fang, I presume you have read ‘Master Lu Spring and Autumn Annals: Examining the Present'[6]The Lüshi Chunqiu, also known in English as Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals,[1][2] is an encyclopedic Chinese classic text compiled around 239 BC under … Continue reading, haven’t you?”
Zhu Yunwen did not directly respond to Fang Xiaoru’s statement. Instead, he replied with a question of his own.
Fang Xiaoru quickly nodded and said, “I have read it.”
Zhu Yunwen earnestly spoke to Fang Xiaoru, “In the state of Chu, there was a person who accidentally dropped his sword into the river while crossing it. He immediately marked the spot on the boat and said, ‘This is where my sword fell.’ When the boat stopped, he entered the water to search for it. However, while the boat moved on, the sword did not move. Isn’t it perplexing to search for the sword in this way? Do you recall this passage, Mr. Fang?”
Fang Xiaoru nodded.
Zhu Yunwen continued, “You dropped the ‘Rites of Zhou’ into the water, and while the boat moved forward, the ‘Rites of Zhou’ followed along in the hidden currents. Carving the boat and searching for it, is the ‘Rites of Zhou’ still there?”
Fang Xiaoru looked at Zhu Yunwen in confusion.
Yu Xin, Zhang Dan, and Xie Jin suddenly realized and understood that the Emperor was warning Fang Xiaoru not too rely heavily on “Rites of Zhou” as a guiding principle, that thing is too old, and not effective anymore.
Adaptation is necessary for smooth progress.
Fang Xiaoru, being astute, understood it and respectfully receive the teaching and stepped aside.
Zhu Yunwen ordered Xie Jin to draft a decree, proclaiming “Grant the world, next year land rent by half”[7]Tl’s note: it means reducing the farming land rent by half. reducing the tax burden in Jiangzhe regions and implementing the policy “land not exceeding one dou[8]TL’s note: although dou used in measuring weights, in ancient times it also used to measure size of land. One dou is around 267 square meters, please correct me if I’m wrong., the people of Suzhou, Songjiang allowed to become officials in ministry of revenue.”, breaking Zhu Yuanzhang’s ancestral teachings.
After resolving the issue of Jiangzhe region’s taxes, as the day grew late, Zhu Yunwen arranged for someone to escort the Grand Secretaries and Fang Xiaoru back home. Then he assigned Wang Yue of The Directorate of Imperial Accouterments to go and meet Zhu Di.
According to court regulations, when a king enters the capital, he is required to spend the night in the Eastern penthouse outside the Gate of Supreme Harmony and present himself to the emperor the next morning.
After settling Zhu Di in, Wang Yue had a conversation with him and expressed that the emperor and the empress dowager were pleased with his arrival. He advised Zhu Di not to be too saddened by the situation.
Zhu Di showed his eloquence and tact, saying that he had brought special products from Beiping. After meeting the emperor the next day, he planned to visit the Empress Dowager at the Cining Palace. He acknowledged his delayed arrival and hoped that Wang Yue could speak a few kind words on his behalf to avoid any blame from the emperor.
As Zhu Di saw Wang Yue off, he maintained a smiling face. However, once Wang Yue left, his smile disappeared.
Zhu Di has already heard the news, the emperor issued an order overnight to assign Zhang Bing, Ping An, Sheng Yong, Qu Neng, and others to take control of Beiping. Meanwhile, troops were stationed along the line from Shanhai Pass to Kaiping.
it is likely that these individuals are already on their way. Zhu Di’s mood is not high, and he is filled with worry and fear, which occasionally overwhelms him.
It is true that it is unlikely for Zhu Yunwen to take action against Zhu Di in the capital during the mourning period. However, he could take action against Beiping. Currently, He is in the capital, and Zhu Gaozhi, Zhu Gaoxu, and Zhu Gaosui are also present. In the King of Yan’s Mansion in Beiping, there are not any individuals who can handle the situation besides Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng.
Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng, are both military commanders, and they have little understanding of strategies. Once they become agitated and cause trouble out of shock, even before he returns, Beiping Prefecture will fall into the hands of Zhu Yunwen.
Taking a step back, if Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng don’t make any moves, Zhu Yunwen will not take any action against himself, when he returns after a period of time, considering the travel distance, it will take at least a month or more.
A period of over a month is enough for Zhu Yunwen to handle the entire defense of Beiping, as well as the surrounding defenses.
And moreover, the personnel appointed by Zhu Yunzhong have made Zhu Di filled with fear!
Sheng Yong?
Zhu Di doesn’t think this person will pose a threat to himself and can be ignored.
But Zhu Di cannot ignore the other two individuals!
The first person is Qu Neng!
Qu Neng, from an early age, accompanied his father in the military and gained extensive combat experience. He excelled in horsemanship, archery, and possessed strategic acumen, earning him a renowned reputation in the court and the public.
Later, he was appointed by Zhu Yuanzhang as the Commander-in-Chief of Sichuan, responsible for overseeing military affairs in the western border regions and assisting the King of Shu, Zhu Chun, in governing the region of Ba and Shu. The region enjoyed two hundred years of peace and prosperity, largely attributed to Qu Neng’s contributions.
He is a formidable individual who is both skilled in martial arts and strategy, making him a formidable force to be reckoned with.
Compared to Qu Neng, the person Zhu Di is more wary of is the second person:
Ping An!
Zhu Di’s eyes revealed a sense of anger and unease.
Ping An, is not an ordinary person, let alone the fact that he was adopted son of Zhu Yuanzhang. Speaking of Ping An himself, he is extremely brave and skilled in battle. In his early years, he accompanied Zhu Di on expeditions beyond the borders and was well acquainted with Zhu Di’s military strategies.
This person knows his capabilities, and Zhu Di also knows his capabilities.
Zhu Di’s hands trembled slightly. Whether he returned or not, it would be extremely difficult to resolve this situation.
Zhu Yunwen, his own beloved nephew, had made such decisive moves! This night, Zhu Di couldn’t sleep peacefully.
The next morning.
Zhu Yunwen arrived at the Hall of Supreme Harmony, with officials standing in their respective positions on the left and right. Zhu Di, who had been waiting in the penthouse, changed into the attire of a King, with Zhu Gaochi and others standing beside him.
The ceremonial officials come out and welcomed the king of Yan into the palace.
Zhu Di followed the ceremonial official, he walked along the imperial path and ascended the dais, and sat on the throne. Zhu Gaozhi and others knelt beside him.
The ceremonial music began, and Zhu Gaozhi and the others turned to the north and prostrated themselves.
Zhu Di gazed toward the north, with fluctuating expression, but he did not kneel.
The officials on both sides of the dais were puzzled and also felt anxious for Zhu Di. If Zhu Di didn’t perform the proper ceremonial gesture, it would be a great disrespect to the Emperor, and the Emperor could use this incident to take action against Zhu Di and strip him of his position as the vassal king.
Zhu Yunwen’s gaze turned towards the outside of the hall, observing Zhu Di who is standing without bowing.
He is a renowned historical Ming emperor, a legendary figure who established the prosperous era of the Yongle, and a formidable warrior who brought great glory to the Ming dynasty.
But it seems that he does not want to pay respects to him!
Zhu Yunwen’s lips curled into a smile, a smile that carried a hint of coldness.
If he refuses to pay respects.
Then let him lie down, it wouldn’t be a bad thing to accompany Zhu Yuanzhang.
Zhu Yunwen is not the Jianwen Emperor in history, the Jianwen Emperor was lenient and hesitant towards Zhu Di, appearing timid like a woman. Zhu Yunwen knows about Zhu Di’s ambition and future, aware of his preparations and threats.
Kill one person to ensure peace in the world, Zhu Yunwen has no reason to hesitate.
At this moment, Zhu Di is hesitant.
Bowing to the north signifies acknowledging Zhu Yunwen’s position as the emperor, which will pose significant difficulties for Zhu Yunwen’s next actions. At the very least, he cannot use Zhu Yunwen’s “manipulating Imperial edicts” as an excuse to manipulate public opinion.
Because, he has submitted, and agreed to it.
If he doesn’t bow to Zhu Yunwen, and Zhu Yunwen uses it as an excuse to take action against him, how can he smooth things over?
The power in the hands of his nephew is no longer just a bunch of bookworms and civil officials, but a force that sends shivers down his spine!
To bow or not to bow!
To submit or not to submit!
Zhu Di was caught in a dilemma, his gaze piercing through space, looking towards Zhu Yunwen sat on the throne in the Hall of Supreme Harmony, and the throne beneath Zhu Yunwen!

Chapter 17: Zhu Di, Bowed!
Standing without bowing!
With a proud demeanor, Zhu Di gazed resolutely toward the direction of the Hall of Supreme Harmony. His upright posture resembled an unwavering spear as he boldly questioned the heavens above.
The officials outside the hall were stunned, exchanging astonished glances with one another. Their eyes were filled with disbelief.
The commotion among those people reached inside the grand hall.
However, the officials in the grand hall, refraining from being disrespectful, did not turn around to look back and remained unaware of what was happening outside.
The first round of salutations is concluded.
The inner praising official trembled as he invited Zhu Di to step forward and led him to the Royal seat in the Hall of Supreme Harmony. He then retreated with cold sweat covering his body.
At this moment, the ceremonial music resumed.
According to the ceremonial protocol, Zhu Di needs to bring his three sons to kneel and pay respects to the Emperor.
Zhu Gaozhi and his two brothers obediently knelt down following the ceremonial music, but Zhu Di remained standing. Not only that, he wore a proud expression and stared directly at Zhu Yunwen.
The officials in the hall who had not witnessed Zhu Di’s refusal to kneel before, now after they saw this scene, the hall erupted in chaos instantaneously, The hall was filled with buzzing voices of discussion.
Fang Xiaoru stepped forward and sternly accused, “Your Majesty, the King of Yan entered the hall without bowing, showing disrespect to the ritual etiquette and lacking the proper loyalty of a subject. I beseech Your Majesty to punish the King of Yan for his grave disrespect!”
“I concur!”
Chen Di, the Minister of Rites, stepped forward and voiced his agreement.
The head of the Ministry of Rites has spoken, and naturally, the deputy ministers and other officials from the ministry need to express their stance as well.
Seeing this situation, other officials also followed suit in voicing their agreement.
Zhu Yunwen scrutinized Zhu Di, as the distance was too far before, making it difficult to see clearly. Now, being closer, he could observe more distinctly.
Zhu Di had thick, arched eyebrows, a straight nose, deep and bright eyes, and a large beard. Along with his imposing presence, there was an air of arrogance about him.
Zhu Yunwen stared at Zhu Di and suddenly burst into laughter.
A burst of laughter echoed through the hall.
Zhu Di’s heart trembled for a moment!
The Zhu Yunwen in front of him, instead of being angry or furious as Zhu Di would have expected, was laughing?
Based on Zhu Di’s understanding of Zhu Yunwen, he should have been infuriated, pointing at him in a state of disarray, unable to utter a single word!
But now, he was laughing!
This laughter carried with it confidence, strength, and an indescribable pressure that made Zhu Di tremble.
The ministers remained silent, unsure why Zhu Yunwen was laughing.
Zhu Yunwen suppressed his laughter and looked at Zhu Di, slowly saying, “This is the Hall of Supreme Harmony, not a casual hall. If the King of Yan is tired and not yet awake, you can go to the casual hall and rest for a few hours. We will wait for you to wake up!”
Zhu Di was instantly at a loss for words, his face filled with anxiety.
Zhu Yunwen’s meaning was clear: this place was where the Emperor and ministers discussed important state matters, and regardless of whether Zhu Di was the King of Yan or anyone else, he must adhere to the protocol of the Emperor and ministers.
If Zhu Di felt indignant and wanted to cause trouble because of being “prevented from mourning,” it didn’t matter!
But you must understand, the matter of mourning is a family affair of the Zhu family. If you want to discuss family matters, go to the side hall.
This is the Hall of Supreme Harmony!
There is only Emperor and his subjects!
Only discuss state affairs here!
With a single sentence from Zhu Yunwen, Zhu Di found himself blocked from all possible retreats.
In fact, Zhu Di intended to use the excuse of being hindered in mourning for Zhu Yuanzhang’s death to confront Zhu Yunwen. If Zhu Yunwen claimed to be following a posthumous decree, another problem would arise: Zhu Di could question why Zhu Yunwen allowed other vassal kings to enter the capital while denying his own entry.
In summary, Zhu Di can seize the initiative, and even if he behaves impolitely, there might be understandable reasons behind it.
But now, Zhu Di has lost this way. It is inappropriate to bring up family matters in the Hall of Supreme Harmony.
If Zhu Di forcefully uses this as an excuse, it is unlikely that Zhu Yunwen will listen, and the officials in the court will not easily accept it either.
Zhu Di, For the first time, discovered that his nephew seemed different from before.
The court officials, including some nobles and aristocrats such as Xu Huizu, Li Jinglong, and Geng Bingwen, were all looking at disrespectful Zhu Di. Their expressions were filled with anger, but their eyes were shifting, indicating that they were contemplating something.
Xie Jin withdrew his foot that was about to step forward. The silence in this situation had a more powerful effect than any words spoken.
Indeed, the hall fell into silence.
No one spoke another word.
They all stood there, staring at Zhu Di.
The wordless silence made the entire space feel oppressive, and this pressure continued to erode Zhu Di’s resolve.
Zhu Gaochi, Zhu Gaoxu, and Zhu Gaosui were already trembling.
If their father refuses to bow to the emperor today, the best outcome for the three of them would be to hold hands with Zhu Di and find a place to farm.
As for the worst outcome, the three of them dare not even imagine.
Zhu Yunwen looked at Zhu Di, and Zhu Di looked at Zhu Yunwen.
They engaged in a silent showdown.
Zhu Di could clearly see the constant smile at the corner of Zhu Yunwen’s mouth, but there was a coldness, a ruthless coldness, in his eyes. He couldn’t help but recall that not long ago, Zhu Yunwen had appointed Ping An, Qu Neng, and others to enter Beiping and its surroundings.
The situation has changed, and Zhu Di finds himself with no way out.
Zhu Di lowers his head, takes a deep breath, slowly kneels down, and prostrates himself on the ground. He exclaims, “Your subject Zhu Di, pay his respects to Your Majesty.”
Reclutant!
But he cannot refuse to bow!
Zhu Di endured it!
He carefully concealed his desire for imperial power.
He knelt today so that he wouldn’t have to kneel in the future!
As Zhu Di knelt, the whole court breathed a sigh of relief, and the atmosphere gradually eased.
The smile at the corner of Zhu Yunwen’s mouth disappeared, and his expression turned serious.
Zhu Di is a great man, capable of bending and stretching, and skilled in deception and performance.
He may kneel with his legs, but his heart remains unyielding.
“You may rise.”
Zhu Yunwen raised his hand and spoke in a cold tone, looking at Zhu Di and the others as they stood up. He said, “At the time of Taizu’s passing, I was solely focused on following the imperial edict, neglecting the familial bond within the royal family, which resulted in the delayed return of the King of Yan for mourning in the capital. This was my fault.”
“Your Majesty, the instruction from Taizu for the kings to stay in their respective fiefdoms and not come to the capital is unrelated to you. It is inappropriate to solely attribute the fault to you. I implore Your Majesty to retract your statement.”
Fang Xiaoru quickly exclaimed.
Upon seeing Zhu Yunwen taking the initiative and assuming the blame for the oversight, thereby preempting any further inquiries regarding the obstruction of mourning, Zhu Di realized that pressing the matter further would make him appear petty. Thus, he was forced to change his stance and said, “Academician Fang’s words are correct. Although I have grievances, I dare not defy the intentions of Emperor Taizu. Since it is Emperor Taizu’s decree, I shall abide by it.”
Zhu Yunwen sighed and said, “Wrong is wrong, a ruler who dares not admit their mistakes and confront them cannot effectively govern the world. I reflect on myself three times a day and understand a principle: for minor mistakes, they can be corrected; for moderate mistakes, they can be rectified; but for major mistakes, they cannot be easily forgiven…”
The four words “cannot be easily forgiven” resonated in Zhu Di’s ears, causing him to tremble. He looked up and saw Zhu Yunwen staring at him.
Is this a warning to him, telling him to turn back?
“I hope everyone will reflect diligently, and encourage open discussions, and if I have made any mistakes, you may submit written reports for me to review. However, I require one thing: I do not need hearsay and baseless accusations. I need solid evidence and valid arguments. Let us put an end to such matters that lack substance and are driven by personal agendas.”
The words of Zhu Yunwen energized the court.
Especially for the officials who had survived the Hongwu reign, they finally breathed a sigh of relief. This meant that the Emperor would no longer resort to punishing officials without reason, nor would he allow anyone’s malicious schemes to result in indiscriminate punishment.
Zhu Di silently nodded upon hearing Zhu Yunwen’s words.
This nephew indeed possesses some tactics when it comes to governance.
The meetings in court gradually shifted away from focusing on Zhu Di and turned to trivial matters of little significance. After the court session, Zhu Di entered the Qianqing Palace to pay respects to Empress Dowager Lu.
The Hall of Great Accomplishment, King of Zhongshan’s Mansion.
Zhu Di arrived slowly in his carriage, and outside the King of Zhongshan’s Mansion, Duke Wei, Xu Huizu, Deputy Commander of Central Army, Xu Yingxu, Left commander of Right Army, Xu Zengshou, The three individuals had been waiting for a long time to welcome him.
Xu Da was the foremost military general of the Hongwu era. To consolidate his relationship with Xu Da, Zhu Yuanzhang arranged for Zhu Di to marry Xu Da’s eldest daughter, Xu Yihua.
As the son-in-law of Xu Da, it was necessary for the King of Yan to pay a visit to the King of Zhongshan’s Mansion and meet his brother-in-law, Xu Huizu. After all, At this time, Xu Huizu held the highest military rank and was considered the most distinguished military general.
Although Zhu Di enjoyed a prominent position in Beiping Prefecture, he was still far from the central government. If he didn’t establish strong connections, In the event that the emperor wanted to take action against him one day, without even having someone to deliver a message, that would be disastrous.
Whether it is for the sake of family relations or for his own future considerations, Zhu Di needs to come.
The carriage came to a stop, and Zhu Di stepped out from it.
Xu Huizu and others approached and bowed in salute.
Zhu Di quickly stopped them and said, “No need for so many formalities, my little brothers-in-law.”
Xu Huizu maintained a cold expression and persisted in performing the formalities. He then said, “Your Highness, upon your return to the capital, it is proper to observe the proper protocols. If the Xu family does not perform the appropriate greetings, wouldn’t it be a breach of etiquette?”
The pupils of Zhu Di’s eyes slightly constricted. Xu Huizu’s words seemed to praise Zhu Di for being courteous, but in reality, they were reproachful words. Xu Huizu was admonishing him for not kneeling and paying respects during the morning court for a prolonged period, indicating a lack of proper etiquette.
Unexpectedly, after not seeing each other for over three years, his little brother-in-law didn’t give him any face upon their meeting.
It seems that his heart has already been given to Zhu Yunchen.
Unable to compete!
Zhu Di made an internal judgment.
“Big Brother, it’s not easy for Brother-in-law to come to the capital. Now that he’s visiting our family, there’s no need to be so serious. Brother-in-law, please come in quickly.”
Xu Zengshou, seeing that the atmosphere is a bit awkward, quickly spoke up.
Xu Huizu glared fiercely at his younger brother, his face slightly darkened. However, Zhu Di paid no attention and smiled faintly as he entered the residence. After paying respects at the family’s ancestral temple, he proceeded to the main hall.
Zhu Di arranged for people to bring the gifts intended for Xu Family from Xu Yihua into residence, in place of Xu Yihua, he inquired about their well-being and gave them warm greetings. reminding them to take care of their health and other such concerns.
“By the way, why isn’t the fourth sister present?” Zhu Di inquired.
The corner of Xu Huizu’s mouth twitched slightly, but he ultimately didn’t say anything.
Xu Zengshou, on the other hand, was more proactive and said, “Brother-in-law, Miaojin is currently at the Imperial Academy and has been quite busy lately. She might not be able to take time off.”
“Imperial Academy?”
Zhu Di was taken aback.
Zhu Di was not aware of such a minor matter.
“Suddenly hearing that Xu Miaojin has entered the Imperial Academy, Zhu Di couldn’t help but feel astonished. After all, how could Zhu Di doesn’t knows what kind of place the Imperial Academy is, how could a mere young woman be allowed to mess around!”
“His Majesty entrust Miaojin to enter the Imperial Academy as Chief of Education to look for talents….”
Xu Zengshou chuckled and his gaze was full of mockery regarding this appointment.
Although Xu Zengshou cares for his younger sister, but Xu Miaojin is still young at the age of eighteen. As a young girl, how could she possibly understand the meaning of talent?
This appointment by the Emperor is simply absurd.
There was a hint of unusual brilliance in Zhu Di’s eyes. this nephew of his was bold and audacious, repeatedly defying the will of the founding emperor and going against the ancestral teachings. Perhaps this matter could be manipulated to his advantage…

Chapter 18: Zhu Di understands Marketing and Public Relations
Zhu Di did not stay long in the Xu family, as he hastily left without even having a meal due to Xu Huizu’s indifferent attitude. This incident left Xu Zengshou somewhat dissatisfied with Xu Huizu
After Zhu Di left, Xu Zengshou returned to his room and looked directly at Xu Huizu, asking, “Elder brother, brother-in-law is our family, can’t you treat him well?”
Xu Huizu coldly stared at Xu Zengshou and said, “Remember this, you must not get too close to the King of Yan!”
“Why? Are we not even allowed to interact with our own family members?” Xu Zengshou asked discontentedly.
Xu Huizu shook his head and sternly warned, “Don’t you know that he refused to bow at the court today? If it wasn’t for the pressure from the emperor, do you think he would have bowed? If it wasn’t for the emperor’s rearrangement of the defense in Beiping Prefecture, do you think he would have bowed? Remember this, his ambition is enough to bring disaster upon the Xu family!”
Xu Zengshou, seeing Xu Huizu becoming more agitated as he spoke, quickly lowered his head and listened to the admonition. He then said, “Elder brother is right, I will follow your arrangements.”
Xu Huizu, knowing that Xu Zengshou had always been close to Zhu Di, saw that he had taken the warning seriously and didn’t say anything further.
Nowadays, Xu Huizu no longer has much energy to manage the Xu family because the new military policy is steadily progressing. This is the most crucial matter for Xu Huizu to establish himself in the court and gain the recognition of Zhu Yunwen.
As long as the new military policy is successfully implemented, Xu Huizu believes that even if Zhu Di or the nine border kings join forces, they would not be a match for the Capital army.
From ancient times to the Ming Dynasty, soldiers only served for the sake of receiving pay and rations from the emperor. In other words, they were merely fighting to survive.
But things are different now!
These soldiers will possess unwavering beliefs and a noble faith in protecting and defending the Great Ming Empire.
They are the most formidable soldiers in the hands of Zhu Yunwen. They will burn themselves for the future of the empire, even if it means turning into bricks and tiles!
“The Art of War” by Sun Tzu highlights the six aspects: “as swift as the wind, as gentle as the forest, as fierce as fire, as immovable as a mountain, as elusive as a shadow, and as sudden as thunder.” However, it primarily emphasizes the soldiers’ physical qualities such as speed, bravery, loyalty, and uniformity, rather than placing a significant emphasis on their thoughts and mindset.
Zhu Yunwen creatively incorporated ideological development and introduced a series of innovative methods for training new soldiers, which surprised Xu Huizu. After undergoing the training, everyone was dripping with sweat, indicating that although the training content was simple, it was extremely physically demanding.
Not only that, but Zhu Yunwen also ordered the improvement of the food for the Capital Garrison and established a department called “Capital Garrison Family Affairs Bureau,” specifically responsible for managing the affairs of the families of capital garrison soldiers.
If a soldier or their family member fell seriously ill, the emperor would provide fifty percent of the medical expenses.
If a soldier’s family member is assaulted by a landlord, or if their land is occupied, or if they get involved in a lawsuit, there’s no need to panic. They can directly find the Capital Garrison Family Affairs Bureau, and the bureau will take responsibility for handling the matter.
If the Capital Garrison Family Affairs Bureau is unable to resolve the issue, it can be escalated to Five Army Commandery.
If even the Five Army Commandery cannot handle the situation, it can be reported to the emperor through a formal report.
In summary, soldiers are the soldiers of the emperor, the soldiers of the Ming Empire. The families of the soldiers should enjoy the benefits and honor that come with their connection to the army.
Even if a soldier dies on the battlefield, the empire will provide generous compensation. In addition to a one-time payment of twenty taels of silver or twenty stones of rice, a continuous subsidy will be given for a period of ten years. Every year, the soldier’s family will receive a subsidy of five taels of silver or five stones of rice.
Such a system naturally encountered resistance from the Ministry of Revenue. After all, compared to the previous system where the family of a deceased soldier received a one-time payment of thirty-six taels of silver or thirty-six stone of rice, the subsequent expenses were essentially negligible.
It is unknown what methods the emperor used to convince Huang Zicheng and others to accept this new system.
Nowadays, almost every soldier in the Capital garrison is willing to risk their lives for Zhu Yunwen. If Zhu Di lacks foresight and truly harbors ulterior motives, his fate will be extremely tragic.
Xu Hui understands the power’s new military policy, which is why he is more concerned about Zhu Di. His coldness towards Zhu Di is not only a warning to him but also a display of loyalty to Zhu Yunwen.
Currently, Zhu Yunwen has clearly changed his initial attitude and trusts Xu Huizu more. In the past month alone, Xu Huizu has been summoned to the palace more than ten times, while the Duke of Cao, Li Jinglong, hasn’t been summoned once.
Even the new military policy did not involve Li Jinglong.
The implications behind this are something Xu Hui can still comprehend.
Just as Xu Hui was lost in thought, the door was pushed open and Xu Miaojin hurriedly entered the room. She called out to Xu Huizu, “Elder brother, where is my big brother-in-law?”
Xu Huizu frowned as he looked at his younger sister and said, “Why did you come back home instead of searching for talents at the Imperial Academy?”
Xu Miaojin rubbed her temples and replied, “Finding talented individuals is extremely difficult. Up until now, I haven’t found a single person. When I heard that my big brother-in-law had returned, I wanted to seek his advice and ask him what kind of scholar is considered talented. Where is he?”
“He has gone back,” replied Xu Hui.
Xu Hui responded casually.
Xu Miaojin glanced at the sun. It was lunchtime, so why did her big brother-in-law go back already? Could it be that we are short of food? That couldn’t be right. After all, elder brother was Duke of Wei and received a substantial income every year…
“The King of Yan has been feeling a bit weary lately, so he went back early to rest. Didn’t you want someone to give you advice, I can give you advice.”
Xu Huizu felt somewhat frustrated. His sister had gone to the Imperial Academy, but despite not causing any trouble, she hadn’t fulfilled the task assigned to her by Zhu Yunwen. Not only could she not find ten talented individuals, she couldn’t even find one.
There was no one willing to accept Xu Miaojin’s test.
The scholars at the Imperial Academy carried arrogance and prejudice deep in their bones. When they saw that the person assessing them was a female official, they either avoided her or pretended to be ignorant when questioned. No matter how she tried to test them, they simply ignored her.
This made it extremely difficult for Xu Miaojin to make any progress. In desperation, she sought help from Xu Huizu for some advice, but Xu Huizu always said that she had to rely on her own wisdom.
Xu Miaojin rolled her eyes in frustration. If she had the wisdom, why would she need to seek his help?
During this challenging time, when Xu Miaojin heard that her brother-in-law Zhu Di had returned, she hurried back to seek his advice, only to be disappointed.
Xu Hui had no solution and could only ask Xu Miaojin, “What kind of person did the Emperor ask you to find?”
“Talented individuals,” Xu Miaojin replied without hesitation.
“Then what is considered talented?” Xu Hui asked.
Xu Miaojin suddenly felt bewildered.
Indeed, what is considered talented?
Xu Hui sighed and said, “In the book ‘Discussive Weighing: Annoyances and Vexations[1]Lunheng 論衡 “Discussive Weighing” is a philosophical treatise written by the Later Han period 後漢 (25-220) scholar Wang Chong 王充.,’ it is mentioned that ‘the superiority or inferiority of talents cannot be judged equally.’ In ‘Baopuzi[2]The Baopuzi 抱朴子 “Master embracing simplicity”, occasionally written 抱樸子, is a Daoist treatise written by the Jin period 晉 (265-420) … Continue reading: The Rusticating People,’ it states ‘praise the virtuous and value morality, delight in nurturing talented individuals.’ And in ‘Shitong[3]Shitong 史通 “All about historiography” is one of China’s oldest books containing a systematic critique to historiography. It was written by … Continue reading: Narrative,’ it says, ‘Hence, we know that talents differ, their distances like this, how can we compare their merits, can they be of the same generation?’ From this, it can be seen that talented individuals refer to those who possess abilities and knowledge.”
“Those who can enter the Imperial Academy for study do have some knowledge. But if we look at the court as a whole, who doesn’t possess knowledge? The question is, having knowledge, do they also have abilities and the capability to accomplish things?”
“When faced with a problem, a talented individual is someone who can identify the root cause, find solutions, and prevent similar issues from occurring again. On the other hand, those who can only talk about the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, benevolence, righteousness, and morality without offering any practical solutions are mediocre talents!”
“Since you’re looking for talented individuals, I’ll give you two suggestions. The first one is…”
Upon hearing Xu Huizu’s words, Xu Miaojin’s eyes widened, nodding repeatedly, rubbing her hands together in excitement. She exclaimed, “I knew it, brother, you’re always the best to me!”
Xu Huizu smiled and sent Xu Miaojin back to the Imperial Academy. He himself went to the vital military area of the Capital garrison, cooperating with Tie Xuan, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of War, to implement various policies and promote new training methods for the soldiers.
Meanwhile, Zhu Di, after leaving the King of Zhongshan’s residence, didn’t return to the King of Yan’s mansion. Instead, he visited other vassal king’s mansions, and he spend more than ten days either reconnecting with the kings or visiting nobles and ministers, such as Duke of Cao, Li Jinglong, and Marquis of Wu Ding, Guo Ying.
Some people received him earnestly, treating him with great respect and giving him ample face.
Some people, on the other hand, dealt with him in a perfunctory manner, being cautious and merely going through the motions.
Nevertheless, Zhu Di treated everyone with courtesy.
What Zhu Di wanted was not just to be a guest, but rather, public opinion!
Prior to this, the people in Nanjing had heard rumors that Zhu Di “refused to pay respects to the Emperor” and “violated the rites of a vassal,” but it was only hearsay. Now, they saw Zhu Di walking through the streets, visiting old friends, receiving lavish hospitality, and displaying great affability. The previous rumors were completely shattered.
“If the King of Yan shows such courtesy to his guests, how can he possibly refuse to pay respects to the Emperor?”
“There must be malicious individuals spreading false accusations against the King of Yan.”
“The King of Yan is a man of loyalty and filial piety. He would never do such a thing.”
As a result, public opinion shifted, and the voices praising Zhu Di grew louder.
Zhu Yunwen sitting in the Wuying Hall, listened to Liu Changge’s report and couldn’t help but smile with delight.
He didn’t expect that Zhu Di was someone who understood self-promotion, self-marketing, and the creation of public opinion to expand his influence.
It must be said that Zhu Di’s public relations and marketing skills were quite effective.
Zhu Yunwen even received numerous memorial letters praising Zhu Di. Whether explicitly or implicitly, they all conveyed a message to Zhu Yunwen:
Zhu Di is the King of Yan. Although he didn’t give you a face during court sessions, don’t be angry. After all, the King of Yan is the leader of all the Kings, the supreme commander in the north. You must take action against him, for any disturbance caused by such an action would be catastrophic…
Among these memorials, some are from distinguished military generals, while others are from officials of lower ranks.
With intricate connections and intertwined roots, upon closer examination, without exception, they are all related to Zhu Di and share an extraordinary relationship.
“Has the Prince of Yan visited the King of Qiyang’s residence again?” 
Emperor Zhu Yuncheng squinted his eyes and asked.
Liu Changge nodded slightly and reported, “Yes.”
Zhu Yunwen lightly tapped the table and suddenly remembered something. He pulled out a memorial from the table and said softly, “The Governor of Guangdong has reported that the sea pirates are rampant and have repeatedly attacked various places in Guangzhou. This is indeed a major issue.”
Liu Changge remained silent.
Zhu Yunwen pointed to the memorials praising Zhu Di and said to Liu Changge, “Compile a list of names for me. I have use for it.”
Liu Changge took the memorial and left.
August 1st.
Zhu Yunwen presided over the court and presented this seemingly insignificant memorial from Guangzhou. He addressed the ministers, saying, “Guangzhou has reported that there are numerous sea pirates in Yangjiang, Guanghai, Xinning, Wuchuan, Suixi, and other places. They are disturbing our territory and killing our people. Guangzhou has petitioned for assistance. I would like to hear the opinions of the ministers. Whom should we send to quell the unrest?”

Chapter 19: Deploying Great Duke to Suppress Sea Pirates.
The words of Zhu Yunwen left the members of the Grand Secretariat momentarily dumbfounded, They stared at each other with wide eyes and puzzled expressions.
Yuxin, Zhang Dan, and Xie Jin had all seen the report, and the content seemed, probably, should be, not as serious as the Emperor said.
They clearly stated:
“In the coastal areas, there are frequent activities of pirates, ranging from a few individuals to several hundred, causing constant disturbances. The Guangzhou Garrison, commanding three thousand soldiers, has conducted operations in Yangjiang, Guanghai, Xinning, Wuchuan, Suixi, and other areas. With a sacrifice of thirty lives and fifty injuries, they have successfully eliminated five hundred pirates.”
This seems to be a report of their achievements. How did it become a plea for assistance in the Emperor’s words?
Could it be that there’s some hidden motive?
With his quick thinking, Xie Jin understood the Emperor’s intention. He loudly exclaimed, “Your Majesty, Guangzhou is a crucial gateway in the southern part of the empire. It must not be lost. In my opinion, only a senior minister can handle this task.”
“Oh?”
Emperor Zhu Yunwen looked at Xie Jin with satisfaction. This one of the Three Great Talents was indeed living up to his reputation.
“Minister Xie, who do you think is capable of shouldering this important responsibility?”
Emperor Zhu Yunwen asked with a smile.
Xie Jin was about to speak up, but suddenly realized that mentioning a particular name could potentially cause trouble. After all, although he had entered the Grand Secretariat, his foundation was still shallow compared to the powerful nobles.
Xie Jin bowed and said, “Your Majesty, this matter can be inquired with the Ministry of Personnel.”
Zhu Yunwen smiled faintly, he understand that Xie Jin had seen through his intentions and was trying to be cunning. However, he didn’t mind and turned his gaze to Qi Tai, asking, “Minister Qi, who do you think is capable of shouldering this important responsibility?”
The Ministry of Personnel was responsible for recommending talented individuals.
Minister of Personnel, Qi Tai stepped forward and exclaimed, “I believe Marquis of An Lu, Wu Jie is capable of assuming this position.”
Zhu Yunwen frowned and said, “Marquis of An Lu is currently in charge of military training in Zhejiang and is also responsible for coastal defense. It may be difficult for him to spare his time.”
“How about Marquis of Jiang Yin, Wu Gao…”
“Wu Gao’s health has been poor recently…”
“What about Commander Gu Cheng…”
“I have other arrangements for Gu Cheng, it’s not suitable…”
Qi Tai successively recommended several individuals, but Zhu Yunwen rejected them all.
Qi Tai was not a fool either, at this time if he couldn’t figure it out, it’d be a waste of his officialdom.
Clearly, the emperor already had someone in mind, but due to his status, he couldn’t openly declare it himself. That’s why he sought recommendations from his subordinates, and when Xie Jin declined to suggest a candidate, he passed the ball to Qi Tai.
However, Qi Tai was bewildered. He had no idea whom the emperor intended to trap. Surely, it couldn’t be the King of Yan.
Nervously, Qi Tai glanced at Zhu Yunwen and saw that the emperor slightly turned his head toward the side of the military elite. Qi Tai followed his gaze and realized that the emperor seemed to be looking at the Duke of Wei, Xu Huizu.
Wait!
Xu Huizu is currently busy training the new army in the capital and cannot be available for this task.
In that case, who else could it be?
Qi Tai widened his eyes, swallowed nervously, and steadied himself. Then he shouted loudly, “I believe that this matter is crucial for the peace and prosperity of our nation. It requires a formidable force to completely eradicate the sea pirates. The one who can handle such a momentous task and lead our Ming Dynasty’s expedition in the south is none other than Duke of Cao.”
Upon hearing his name being called, Li Jinglong, who was dozing off, suddenly trembled.
He had drunk too much last night and didn’t sleep well.
Could it be that he was experiencing auditory hallucinations?
Just as Li Jinglong was feeling a bit disoriented, Zhu Yunwen nodded in satisfaction and said, “Minister Qi’s words are correct. This will be the first battle since my ascension to the throne, and it must be ensured with utmost caution. It will showcase the might of our Ming army, protect our territories, and ensure the safety of our people. We must dispatch a senior minister for this task! In that case, Duke Cao!”
“Here I am!”
Li Jinglong quickly stepped forward and paid his respects.
“I appoint you as the Great General of pacifying the south, Li Zengzhi as the Commander-in-Chief, Xu Zengshou as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief, Li You, Xu Hong, Chen Yue… eight individuals as participating generals. Starting tomorrow, you will march to Guangzhou and join forces with the Guangzhou Commandery to eradicate the sea pirates and protect our Ming Dynasty!”
Zhu Yunwen stood up and shouted with authority.
No room for discussion!
No room for questioning!
The command of Zhu Yunwen left Li Jinglong feeling as if he had been struck by lightning. He numbly expressed his gratitude and accepted the order.
Inside the grand hall, officials whispered and discussed among themselves.
Using a Great Duke to suppress small pirates?
How serious is the situation with the Guangzhou pirates?
Isn’t this deployment giving too much face to those pirates?
Could it be that Guangzhou has already completely fallen?
They haven’t heard anything about it!
“Your Majesty, I believe that the Duke of Cao is a pillar of the empire and should not be easily deployed. Although Guangzhou is troubled by pirates, it is sufficient to mobilize a regional commander or a marquis to suppress the chaos.”
The Commander of the Capital Guard, Wang Zuo, stepped forward to voice his opposition.
“We concur,” several inconspicuous officials spoke up.
Zhu Yunwen coldly stared at the officials who opposed him and spoke sternly, “While the people of Guangzhou are trapped in turmoil, all of you are still deliberating over who should be deployed? Wang Zuo, if I send you, can you guarantee victory? I am well aware that without eliminating the pirates, Guangzhou and the stability of the empire will be at risk! As the Commander, don’t you understand this simple fact?”
“The Duke of Cao is someone I trust and he is also the heir of the King of Qiyang. With his military expertise, once he takes action, remarkable results will be achieved! He will thoroughly eradicate the pirates and secure a peaceful southern gateway for me. How dare you oppose, What are your ulterior motives?”
Wang Zuo, startled by Zhu Yunwen’s outburst, quickly knelt down and kowtowed.
If they continue to oppose, they are unsure of whether the pirates will be eradicated, but their own heads will surely be taken off.
Zhu Yunwen spoke sternly, “By appointing the Duke of Cao, I am sending a message to the world that I, for the safety of the empire and its people, am willing to use the Duke of Cao without hesitation! Even if the need arises, I myself can take the lead, don armor, and go into battle to kill the enemy! Duke of Cao, do you have the courage to thoroughly eradicate the pirates and share the burden with me?!”
Duke of Cao, Li Jinglong, quickly knelt and shouted, “I have the courage and I am willing to share the burden for Your Majesty!”
At this point, if they don’t lower their heads, they will be finished.
The emperor has spoken, declaring that if no one else goes, he will personally lead the troops.
What choice does Li Jinglong have but to comply?
Who would dare let the new emperor from going to battle himself?
As a loyal subject, if he cannot share the emperor’s burdens, how can he continue to hold his position in the court?
Moreover, Zhu Yunwen expressed his trust and willingness to utilize the Duke and delivered a fervent speech filled with determination and a thirst for action. It was enough to make Li Jinglong willingly embark on the mission.
Zhu Yunwen after settling the matter with Li Jinglong, glanced at the officials who had opposed him and said, “Wang Zuo and others, follow the army in the expedition. Use your eyes and hearts to witness the suffering of the people affected by the disasters. Then come back and tell me whether my decision was right or wrong!”
The entire court was shocked.
Did opposition result in immediate conscription?
Isn’t that too harsh?
Although they weren’t going as frontline soldiers, following the army in the expedition still carried risks. The battlefield does not discriminate, and if the pirates were to attack, they might end up sacrificing themselves heroically.
In reality, Wang Zuo was more concerned about meeting a heroic fate on the way there.
From Nanjing to Guangzhou, there are approximately three thousand miles, and it would take at least two to three months to travel southward. What if he can’t adapt to the local environment? He could end up losing his life in the unfamiliar lands of the Great Ming.
Unfortunately, Wang Zuo’s plea had no effect.
Zhu Yunwen did not give him a chance.
After the court meeting ended, Zhu Yunwen left, and the officials smiled and looked at Li Jinglong.
Yu Xin, Zhang Dan, and Xie Jin, with bowed hands, congratulated, “Upon the new emperor’s ascension, Duke of Cao has been entrusted in the first battle, showing that he has received great blessings from the heavens.”
Li Jinglong’s smile at the corners of his mouth appeared very unnatural.
Received great blessings from the heavens?
Why don’t I feel that at all?
Looking back now, why does it feel like being exiled to Guangzhou?
After accepting sincere or insincere congratulations from the ministers, Li Jinglong returned to King Qiyang’s residence in a state of confusion. He looked at his younger brother, Li Zengzhi, and suddenly asked, “It seems that all the arrangements made by the emperor are our people, right?”
Li Zengzhi frowned and thought for a moment before saying, “Except for Xu Zengshou, most of them are our people! Elder Brother, the arrangements this time, could it be that the Emperor has noticed something?”
Li Jinglong sighed and said, “That’s right. The Emperor has never taken action and remained oblivious to our interactions with the king of Yan. Hehe, I thought he was weak, but it turns out he has been concealing his strength! Our Emperor is not simple!”
Li Zengzhi felt somewhat frustrated and asked, “What should we do? Should we go to Guangzhou?”
Li Jinglong fell into contemplation.
During this period, the Li family had been building relationships with the King of Yan and the King of Ning. They were about to conclude the mourning period, and these vassal kings would soon depart. Li Jinglong had planned to bid them farewell with a heartfelt parting, hoping to meet again in the future.
Unexpectedly, before they could leave, he himself was now being sent away.
If he were to go to Guangzhou, it would mean that the Li family could not serve as support for the King of Yan, the King of Ning, and others.
Li Jinglong understood the principle of being unable to reach faraway goals.
Li Zengzhi didn’t think that far ahead and instead said, “Big brother, we have always wanted to become the foremost noble family, surpassing Xu Huizu. Now, perhaps this is an opportunity.”
“An opportunity? Don’t you think this is a trap?” Li Jinglong’s face turned cold.
Going to Guangzhou, such a distant place, would take at least half a year-round trip, or even up to a year.
If he doesn’t perform well, he might end up staying there for a long time, living his days at sea.
If he does a good job, and Zhu Yunwen is pleased, he might appoint him as the commander of the anti-piracy forces and have him stationed in Guangzhou to fight against the pirates for a long term. That would be the end of his life.
This is simply a massive trap, a treacherous trap that can cost us his lives.
Li Zengzhi smiled and said, “Big brother, don’t worry. The Emperor will never let us stay in Guangzhou for long, and even if we stay, it won’t be for long.”
“Why is that?” Li Jinglong looked at his younger brother in surprise.
Li Zengzhi chuckled, “Firstly if we successfully eliminate the pirates, it’s only natural to return triumphantly. Secondly, if the Emperor doesn’t allow us to return, we can always seek Empress Dowager’s intervention. And besides, isn’t there still the third son of the Xu family? If we don’t come back, can the third son of the Xu family come back? If he returns, then we have to return too, right?”
“The most important thing is that we just need to employ a little strategy. The Emperor will surely need us to go and return early. And when we return, the Duke of Wei, Xu Huizu, will be beneath you, big brother.”
Li Jinglong looked at Li Zengzhi curiously and asked, “What kind of strategy?”
Li Zengzhi leaned in close to Li Jinglong’s ear and whispered, “Confidentially report to the Emperor, claiming that the King of Ning and the King of Yan have ulterior motives.”
Li Jinglong stood up abruptly, pointing at Li Zengzhi, and angrily exclaimed, “How can we do such actions!”
“Brother, please calm down. The key point of what we will inform the emperor is not about the loyalty of the two kings, but rather the close relationship between Xu Huizu and the King of Yan. You must understand that they are relatives by marriage. If the King of Yan rebels, can the emperor trust Xu Huizu, who is the King of Yan’s brother-in-law? Can he entrust the imperial army to his command? Absolutely not!”
Li Zengzhi confidently looked at the contemplative Li Jinglong and added, “Brother, you must know that in the royal court, loyalty is of utmost importance, followed by abilities. Although we may not be as capable as Xu Huizu, if we can excel in loyalty, hehe…”

Chapter 20: Naval Forces? Li Jinglong changed his stance.
Inside the King of Yan Mansion, Zhu Di reclined on a rattan chair with two maids fanning him. Although it had transitioned into the middle of autumn in the eighth month, the heat had somewhat subsided, but it still felt sultry at noon. The weather seemed gloomy as if it was about to rain.
Zhu Gaoxu informed Zhu Di about the appointment of Li Jinglong as the Great General pacifying the South and his upcoming departure for Guangzhou.
Upon hearing this, Zhu Di’s face immediately turned dark. He waved his hand, dismissing the maids, and then spoke to Zhu Gaoxu, saying, “There are pirates causing trouble in Guangzhou? Is this information true or false?”
Zhu Gaoxu hastily replied, “The news comes from the general secretariat, and it is indeed true that there are pirates in Guangzhou. A few days ago, the Governor of Guangzhou even submitted a memorial stating that they had beheaded five hundred pirates. It seems to be a merit-seeking action and not a loss of control.”
A twitch appeared at the corner of Zhu Di’s mouth, and his gaze was filled with concern as he said, “To employ a Duke for such petty pirates? What if there are larger bandits? Does that mean the Emperor will have to lead the expedition personally?! There is something suspicious about this matter!”
“Father!”
Zhu Gaochi hobbled over and after paying his respects, he spoke solemnly, “Xiang Zhuang perform sword dances, with the intent directed at Liu Bang[1]Xiang Zhuang performs the sword dance, but his mind is set on Liu Bang (idiom); refers to 206 BC plot to murder Liu Bang, aka Duke of Pei (沛公) and the future Han emperor, during a sword dance at … Continue reading
Zhu Di raised an eyebrow and looked at Zhu Gaochi, speaking with seriousness, “Are you saying that the Emperor’s actions are targeted at us?”
Zhu Gaochi nodded gravely and took out a booklet from his robe, handing it to Zhu Di, saying, “Father, take a look at this.”
Zhu Di opened the booklet and looked inside. It contained a list of personnel accompanying Li Jinglong on his southern expedition. The majority of them had good personal relationships with Zhu Di, and they had been interacting frequently in recent days.
In other words, these were a group of noble figures with their loyalty directed towards the Prince of Yan.
Even Xu Zengshou, the third son of Xu Da, had been dispatched, and Xu Zengshou could be considered as one of the hidden pieces left by Zhu Di in the capital!
But now, this piece was going to be taken out of the capital!
“Xu’er, you should learn more from your brother. This is how things should be handled,”
Zhu Di glances at Zhu Gaoxu. He then turned to Zhu Gaozhi and said, “You’ve done well in this matter. It seems that the emperor’s network of spies is extremely efficient. The Great Ming Security Bureau is truly formidable!”
Zhu Gaochi was pleased to receive praise from Zhu Di, but he maintained a calm demeanor and said, “Father, it seems that our every move is under the emperor’s surveillance. We won’t be able to stay in the capital for much longer. Perhaps we should wait until the period of mourning is over, then let’s leave this place.”
Zhu Di sighed and replied, “That may be true, but if we want to leave, we may have to wait until after the Mid-Autumn Festival.”
Zhu Di felt a sense of fear for the first time from Zhu Yunwen.
This nephew knew about his secret moves and knew which people were aligned with him or could potentially align with him. That’s why, Zhu Yunwen severed his hand.
This was a silent warning to himself.
Zhu Di didn’t like his current state, feeling restricted and constrained at every turn.
After some time, Ping An and Sheng Yong should have arrived in Beiping Prefecture. By then, would Beiping Prefecture still be under his control?
Zhu Di felt a wave of worry. He stood up, looked at the gloomy sky, and said heavily, “It’s going to rain.”
And finally, it rained.
It wasn’t a torrential downpour, but a gentle, chilly drizzle. Though not heavy, it persisted from the afternoon until the evening without any sign of stopping.
In Wu Ying Hall, where he was reviewing memorials, Zhu Yunwen suddenly heard the report that Li Jinglong requested an audience. He set aside his cinnabar brush, his gaze cold and distant, as he slowly said, “Let him go to the Hall of Preserving Harmony.”
Leaving Wu Ying Hall, Zhu Yunwen looked at the autumn rain falling gently. He reached out and felt the coolness of the rain, and said to his attendant Shuangxi, who wanted to fetch him an umbrella, “No need, let’s go.”
In the Hall of Preserving Harmony.
Li Jinglong knelt and paid his respects, exclaiming, “I pay my respects to His Majesty, long live, long live!”
“Rise, take a seat,” Zhu Yunwen responded.
Zhu Yunwen smiled and made arrangements before asking, “Duke Cao isn’t preparing for the expedition but came to the palace in the middle of the night, is there something urgent? If you encounter any difficulties, you can tell me, and I will solve them for you.”
After expressing his gratitude, Li Jinglong said, “Your Majesty, I have been tasked with a distant expedition, and I will do my utmost to eradicate the sea pirates and swear not to return to the capital until they are eliminated. I have come tonight because I have something that must be reported to Your Majesty in person.”
“Oh?”
Zhu Yunwen glanced at Shuangxi, and Shuangxi led the eunuch out of the room and closed the door.
Li Jinglong, seeing that there were no outsiders present, quickly knelt down and said, “Your Majesty, please forgive me for my rudeness!”
“What rudeness?”
Zhu Yunwen asked calmly.
Li Jinglong took out a memorial from his sleeve, moved forward two steps while still kneeling, and placed the memorial in front of Zhu Yunwen. Then he knelt back down and said, “I have impertinent words to say!”
Zhu Yunwen picked up the memorial and glanced through it. He said, “The King of Yan has ulterior motives? Are you trying to sow discord between us, uncle and nephew?”
Li Jinglong kowtowed vigorously and exclaimed, “Your Majesty, every word I said is true. I arranged for Li Zengzhi to secretly make contact with the King of Yan and discovered that he is coveting the imperial throne, relying on his military forces. If Your Majesty does not take early action to curb his power, it may lead to disaster!”
“Heh, it’s just 80,000 troops, nothing that can cause much trouble,” Zhu Yunwen set the memorial aside and then asked Li Jinglong, “You also mentioned Xu Huizu. Do you believe that Xu Huizu is loyal?”
Li Jinglong squinted his eyes slightly and quickly responded, “I believe that Duke Wei is intelligent, broad-minded, exceptionally capable, and possesses strong leadership skills. He is undoubtedly loyal to Your Majesty. However, there is one thing… the King of Zhongshan’s mansion relationship with the King of Yan goes beyond mere marriage alliance; their personal connection is also quite close… I hope Your Majesty will pay close attention.”
Praise first, then belittle.
First uplift, then undermine, hitting directly at the heart of the matter.
This is the art of speech.
If Zhu Yunwen is indeed the historical Jianwen Emperor, with just these words, he would not dare to use Xu Huizu or at the very least won’t entrust him with absolute authority.
However, Zhu Yunwen knows history, he knows that Xu Huizu was a loyal supporter of the Jianwen Emperor, remaining loyal until his death.
But the current Li Jinglong before his eyes is a shameless traitor!
“Very well… I understand.”
Zhu Yunwen stood up and nodded solemnly at Li Jinglong. Then, he turned around, blocking Li Jinglong’s view, and took out a memorial from his sleeve. He concealed Li Jinglong’s memorial and walked towards a nearby oil lamp. He lit the memorial on fire and looked at Li Jinglong, saying, “We are family, and I count on you to achieve great feats.”
Li Jinglong was pleasantly surprised and quickly bowed, expressing his loyalty. He watched as the memorial turned to ashes, relieved.
Zhu Yunwen gestured for Li Jinglong to sit down and then handed him a report from Guangdong, saying, “In truth, there aren’t many pirates in Guangzhou.”
Li Jinglong naturally knew this, but he still pretended to be surprised as he looked at Zhu Yunwen and asked, “Then why did Your Majesty…”
Zhu Yunwen laughed heartily and said, “Because, I sent you to Guangzhou not only to deal with the pirates but also for a more important mission. Otherwise, why would I have sent you there?”
Li Jinglong was pleasantly surprised. No wonder the Emperor had arranged for him to go to Hainan. It turned out there was a significant task at hand. He had thought the Emperor was playing tricks on him…
“Please enlighten me, Your Majesty.”
“We will construct sea boats and establish a naval force.”
“A naval force?”
Li Jinglong blinked, looking at Zhu Yunwen with confusion.
Since when did the Ming Dynasty have the concept of a naval force?
Wasn’t it always referred to as navy?”
Zhu Yunwen’s eyes were clear and solemn as he spoke, “I want a naval forces fleet capable of long-distance voyages across the sea! Guangzhou is situated by the coast and has a well-developed shipbuilding industry, as well as abundant experience in maritime navigation. They should have nautical charts as well. When you arrive in Guangzhou, on the surface, your mission will be to combat pirates, but in reality, I need your assistance in building a formidable navy!”
Li Jinglong remained perplexed.
Wasn’t the Navy sufficient?
Long-distance voyages across the sea?
What could there be in the depths of the sea?
“You have one year to lay the foundation. If you wish to return afterward, you can do so at any time without reporting, but you must ensure the normal operation of the shipyard.”
“If you succeed, you will be the pioneer of the Ming Naval forces! Your achievements will be recorded in the annals of history! If you fail, you will be held accountable for the empire’s sins. It’s better for you to retire early!”
Zhu Yunwen spoke solemnly.
Li Jinglong’s mind was filled with the words “Your achievements will be recorded in the annals of history.” In one’s lifetime, isn’t it all about making a name for oneself?
They may say that I, Li Jinglong, am a fool, incompetent, and can’t even compare to one percent of my father, Li Wenzhong. But I, Li Jinglong, am determined to accomplish something!
The first person of the Ming Navy!
I, Li Jinglong, have made up my mind!
“I, your servant, will fulfill this mission even at the cost of my life!”
Li Jinglong bowed deeply.
Zhu Yunwen’s eyes were filled with anticipation.
Although the Ming Dynasty had faced numerous crises throughout its nearly three-hundred-year history, when looking back at the entire reign of the Ming Dynasty, the navy had an impeccable record!
It could be proudly stated that the Ming Navy was the most formidable naval force of its time!
Whether it was the Portuguese, the Japanese, or the Dutch, none of them could match the Ming Navy!
Certainly, the peak of the Ming Dynasty’s naval power was during the reign of Zhu Di. There were 1,350 warships, 1,350 patrol boats, 400 large ships, and 400-grain transport ships. Additionally, there were 250 treasure ships for long-distance voyages. These figures do not include a significant number of enforcement and messenger boats.
However, Zhu Yunwen believes that as he continues to alter history, Emperor Yongle, Zhu Di, will not reappear in history. His title can only be the King of Yan. Therefore, the Great Ming Navy and Great Ming Maritime Force need to be built by themselves!
In history, although Li Jinglong was regarded as a fool and a traitor, what if he make good use of him?
As long as Zhu Di doesn’t rebel and Li Jinglong doesn’t turn to Zhu Di, he doesn’t mind utilizing him to his fullest potential!
Li Jinglong accepted Zhu Yunwen’s secret order and left the palace with great joy in his heart.
Li Zengzhi was right. This is his chance!
A chance to leave a lasting legacy!
A chance to surpass his father, Li Wenzhong!
As for the schemes of the King of Yan?
To hell with them.
What he wants to do now is a grand endeavor worthy of the empire’s utmost attention.
As for the King of Yan, it would be best for him to stay obediently in Beijing[2]TL’s note: not a mistake, but the author used the word 北京.If he hinders his path to fame and glory if he obstructs the everlasting reputation of the Li family, then he shall be his enemy!
One’s perspective often depends on where they stand.
And where one stands can be changed.
Zhu Yunwen is not sure if he can change Li Jinglong, but it doesn’t matter. Li Jinglong is no longer a threat. At least for a year, he will be required to stay in Guangzhou, unable to secretly contact Zhu Di.
That is sufficient.
As for the Great Ming Navy, Li Jinglong is in charge of just a backup plan.
If it succeeds, it will naturally be a cause for celebration.
If it fails, it doesn’t matter.
Because the real Great Ming Navy fleet has already been secretly initiated at the Longjiang Shipyard outside Dinghuai Gate in Nanjing, and the person directly responsible for it is none other than Zhu Yunwen himself.

Chapter 21: Fourth Uncle, I need a favor from you.
The next morning, Li Jinglong, Li Zengzhi, Xu Zengshou, and others gathered at the training ground, mustering a force of three thousand soldiers.
Zhu Yunwen, along with several kings and ministers, personally bid them farewell, delivering a passionate speech titled “Protecting Our Mountains and Seas in Eternal Tranquility,” which ignited the fiery enthusiasm of Zhu Di, the King of Ning, Xu Huizu, and others.
Everyone initially thought that Li Jinglong would be dispirited and passive in his resistance, considering they were heading to Guangzhou. Not only was the journey long and arduous, but the place itself was also backward and far from being as prosperous as the capital. Going there to fight was not much different from being exiled.
However, no one expected Li Jinglong to be in high spirits, displaying a resolute and heroic demeanor, without a hint of complaint or despair. He made a solemn vow to “eliminate the pirates and never return until justice is served,” and advised the emperor to “eat well, sleep well, and enjoy life” while awaiting his triumphant news. With a big laugh, he led his troops and charged out of Zhengyang Gate.
Xu Huizu, puzzled by this turn of events, glanced at Zhu Yunwen and then averted his gaze.
Regarding Xu Zengshou’s inclusion in the expeditionary force, Zhu Yunwen’s explanation was that Xu Zengshou would serve as his representative to supervise Li Jinglong. In the event of any misconduct by Li Jinglong, Xu Zengshou would secretly report it.
Xu Huizu did not fully accept this explanation. It was clear to him that the emperor was intentionally transferring influential figures associated with the King of Yan away from the capital to weaken his power.
Since the emperor did not explicitly state his intentions, Xu Huizu did not dare to inquire further.
After all, he was Xu Zengshou’s elder brother. If the emperor regarded Xu Zengshou as Zhu Di’s loyalist, how would he view Xu Huizu?
In the following days, Zhu Yunwen focused his attention on the New Military policy, personally participating in their training and the implementation of related policies. Xu Huizu, Tie Xuan, Xie Jin, and others constantly engaged in these efforts, refining the policies and training methods of the New Military.
On August 4th, Zhu Yunwen promoted Song Cheng, the Deputy Commander of the Central Army Commandery, to the position of Right Commander of the Central Army Commandery, acknowledging his meritorious service in defending the region of Xiliang. He was granted the title General of Pacifying Qiang and instructed to participate in the training of the new army.
On the 5th, Liaodong’s Commander in Chief, Yang Wen was granted the title of Marquis of Dong Yuan, defending Liaodong.
On the 6th, Transfer Deputy Commander of the Qiyang Guard, Xu Zhong, to Guizhou, assuming control over the local chieftain.
On the 7th, Transfer Deputy Commander of North Zhili, Chen Heng, to Fujian, stationed along the coastal areas.
Over the course of several consecutive days, Zhu Yunwen either appointed or transferred a group of military commanders. Upon closer observation of the map, one would notice that these individuals were either heading toward Zhu Di or were a consequence of Zhu Di’s actions.
Taking advantage of Zhu Di’s presence in the capital, Zhu Yunwen laid out a large-scale plan. From Liaodong to Datong, from the southern border to Shandong, and from Beiping Prefecture to Shanhai Pass, Kaiping, a total of four hundred thousand troops were deployed, effectively sealing off Beiping.
Zhu Di, of course, was well aware of Zhu Yunwen’s series of movements. However, he was powerless to do anything and could only watch as Zhu Yunwen repeatedly made strategic maneuvers, placing formidable individuals within his area.
Zhu Di understood that Zhu Yunwen was not taking action; he was waiting for Zhu Di to fully submit himself. However, Zhu Di was not willing to give up so easily.
The period of mourning had finally come to an end.
Zhu Yunwen focused on two key areas: reforming the New Army and improving the livelihood of the people. He rectified the wrongful imprisonments during the Hongwu era, provided compensation to those who deserved it, recalled officials who were wrongly dismissed, and reduced taxes in regions such as Guangxi and Guizhou.
These measures not only won the support of the people but also alleviated tensions within the empire, maintaining a relatively stable situation.
To the surprise of the court, Zhu Yunwen never showed any intention of abolishing the feudal fiefs. He didn’t even mention it. Instead, he occasionally invited some kings into the palace for casual conversations, establishing a rather intimate relationship.
On the other hand, Zhu Di remained mostly within the King of Yan’s Mansion and rarely ventured outside.
On this particular day, Zhu Di was engrossed in studying military strategy when he suddenly heard Qiu Fu’s loud voice shouting outside, “I Greet Your Majesty! Long live Your Majesty!”
Zhu Di was startled. Zhu Yunwen had personally come to the King of Yan’s mansion?
“Rise.”
Zhu Yunwen, dressed in his regular attire, was accompanied by Shuangxi, Liu Changge, and Xu Huizu.
Zhu Di hurriedly opened the door and saw Zhu Yunwen’s warm and amicable expression. He wanted to perform a grand gesture of respect but was lifted up by Zhu Yunwen, who said, “Fourth Uncle, today I come as a family member, not as an emperor.”
“Good, good, good.”
Zhu Di repeated “good” three times and gestured for Zhu Yunwen to take a seat, saying, “Please take a seat, Your Majesty. Qiu Fu, serve the tea.”
Zhu Yunwen stepped into the study, walked to the desk, and picked up “The Art of War” by Sun Tzu. He read softly, “Those skilled in warfare can shape the momentum of their forces, much like rolling a round stone down from a thousand-foot mountain. It is all about the momentum. I have heard that Fourth Uncle excels in the application of military momentum.”
Zhu Di was secretly alarmed upon hearing this but quickly responded, “Not at all, I am merely executing the strategies of the Great Ancestor.”
Zhu Yunwen shook his head slightly and said, “In the twenty-third year of the Hongwu reign, Fourth Uncle led his troops out of the Great Wall at Gubeikou[1]Gubeikou Town (simplified Chinese: 古北口镇; traditional Chinese: 古北口鎮; pinyin: Gǔběikǒu Zhèn) is a town of Miyun District in … Continue reading and learned that Nayir Bukha and others were stationed in Yidu. Coincidentally, heavy snowfall occurred. Fourth Uncle, without hesitation, took advantage of the snow and launched a surprise attack on their camp, catching them off guard, just like that round stone rolling down from a thousand-foot mountain.”
“However, Fourth Uncle did not launch a sudden attack to kill Nai Er Bu Hua. Instead, employ tactics to force surrender, utilizing strategies that compelled Nayir Bukha to submit. Without expending much manpower or resources, Fourth Uncle successfully captured tens of thousands of their troops and hundreds of thousands of livestock. It was a great triumph.”
“I have thought more than once that if the day comes when we, uncle and nephew, face each other, Will I be more than just a one-time general in front of you?”
Zhu Di was startled, his soul almost ready to flee.
The Emperor could say such words, isn’t it like directly saying he wants to rebel? Let’s meet each other on the battlefield one day?
“I would rather die a thousand deaths than be an enemy of Your Majesty!”
Zhu Di had no choice but to bow his head and declare hastily, “I was granted the title of King of Yan, defending Beiping prefecture, by the will of Taizu, solely to safeguard the northern borders. I have no personal motives, and I dare not be your enemy. If Your Majesty does not retract these words, I will take my own life here today!”
Zhu Yunwen looked at the trembling Zhu Di, then he paused and burst into laughter, saying, “Uncle, I was merely making metaphorical speculation, just a flight of imagination. It does not imply any doubt about your loyalty, so there is no need to panic like this.”
Zhu Di’s forehead was covered in a cold sweat.
Damn it, you said it out loud, and yet you expect me not to panic?
Who speaks so directly like you?
My poor heart!
“Very well, I take back what I said.”
Seeing that Zhu Di was truly fearful, Zhu Yunwen spoke up.
Just as Zhu Di breathed a sigh of relief, Zhu Yunwen suddenly became serious and asked, “Do you truly have sincere intentions towards me, Fourth Uncle?”
“As clear as the heavens and the earth!” Zhu Di quickly responded.
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and said to Zhu Di, “Then, may I ask Fourth Uncle for a favor? I wonder if it would be possible?”
Zhu Di narrowed his eyes slightly, feeling uneasy, and asked, “May I know what kind of favor Your Majesty is seeking?”
Zhu Yunwen smiled lightly and said, “The Empress Dowager is deeply devoted to Buddhism, and I have heard of a monk named Dao Yan in the Qing Shou Monastery who is well-versed in Buddhist teachings. I would like to invite him to the capital. Fourth Uncle, would you be willing to grant this request?”
Zhu Di looked at Zhu Yunwen in astonishment.
Dao Yan is his trusted adviser and plays a crucial role in many important decisions. If Zhu Yunwen takes Dao Yan away, Zhu Di will be left unable to make any progress. In the future, he won’t have anyone suitable to discuss important matters with!
This move is cutting off the roots!
It’s too ruthless!
But what troubles Zhu Di the most is the hidden meaning behind Zhu Yunwen’s words!
At the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang believed that Buddhism had a negative influence on governance, so he established the “Charity Temple (善世院)” to oversee the management of monks and nuns throughout the country.
In the fifteenth year of the Hongwu reign, Zhu Yuanzhang abolished the Charity Temple and established the Central Buddhist registry (僧录司) and Central Daoist registry (道录司). The Central Buddshit Registry became the highest institution responsible for the management of Buddhist monks under a central authority.
At the level of the prefecture(府), there was the Bureau of Monastic Affairs.
At the level of the departments(州)[2]TL’s note: I used department to differentiate 府 and 州 because both have the same translation), there was the Bureau of Monastic Supervision.



At the county(县)level, there was the Bureau of … Continue reading!”
“Zheng He?” Zhu Di was stunned.
In his memory, there is no such name. 
But judging from the Emperor’s expectant gaze, it doesn’t seem like a joke. 
“Your Majesty, I’m sorry, but I truly can’t recall who Zheng He is.” 
Zhu Di looked at Zhu Yunwen with bewilderment. 
Zhu Yunwen was taken aback. Could it be that he remember it wrong?
It shouldn’t be like this. During Zhu Di’s reign, Zheng He made seven voyages to the West, initially with the mission of searching for the escaped Emperor Jianwen overseas, but later evolving into trade, diplomacy, and political activities. 
Zheng He was Zhu Di’s man.”
“You really don’t know?” Zhu Yunwen looked at Zhu Di uncertainly.
Zhu Di shook his head repeatedly and called over Qiu Fu, asking, “In the King of Yan Mansion, is there anyone named Zheng He?”
Qiu Fu thought carefully and shook his head, saying, “My lord, not only in the King of Yan Mansion but even in the army, I haven’t heard of anyone named Zheng He.”
Zhu Di dismissed Qiu Fu and then looked at Zhu Yunwen.
Zhu Yunwen was somewhat anxious. Without Zheng He, where could he find highly skilled maritime talents? Without talented individuals, how could they explore special products in South America?
To eat beef stew with potatoes, we can only rely on this Eunuch Sanbao.
Eunuch?
Yes!
Zheng He was a eunuch!



---


Chapter 22: I bestow upon you the surname Zheng and the given name He!
Zhu Yunwen looked at Zhu Di and asked, “Is there a eunuch named Zheng He in the King of Yan’s residence?”
“Eunuch?”
Zhu Di was even more confused.
Could the Emperor be pulling his leg?
There is no such person in the entire King of Yan’s residence, how could there be a eunuch?
Zhu Yunwen looked at Zhu Di’s puzzled expression, furrowing his brows. Could it be that Zheng He is not currently by Zhu Di’s side?
This shouldn’t be the case. He himself doesn’t have Zheng He by his side either.
Xu Huizu remained silent, pondering secretly. Who is this Zheng He? What kind of person is he that the Emperor personally inquires about and requests?
Eunuch?
Is the Imperial Palace still in need of eunuchs?
Zhu Yunwen didn’t inquire further. Zhu Di didn’t even say much when requesting Dao Yan, so he wouldn’t say anything about Zheng He either unless he truly didn’t know.
Leaving the study, Zhu Di led Zhu Yunwen towards the back garden. Their conversation became more peaceful, occasionally punctuated by laughter.
In front of the Moon Gate, stood a tall man, approximately two meters in height. When he saw Zhu Yunwen and Zhu Di approaching from afar, he knelt down to the side.
Zhu Yunwen glanced at him and walked into the Moon Gate. However, after taking a few steps, he suddenly stopped and turned to look outside the gate. He asked Zhu Di, “Who is this guard?”
“Ma Sanbao.”
Zhu Di quickly responded.
Zhu Yunwen’s eyes lit up.
Damn it, how could I forget? The name Zheng He is because, during the Jingnan Period, Ma Sanbao provided advice and strategies to Zhu Di in the Battle of Zhengcunba, helping him achieve victory. Later, when Zhu Di became the emperor, he bestowed the surname Zheng and the given name He upon Ma Sanbao.
No wonder I couldn’t find him!
Zhu Yunwen walked back, and Ma Sanbao wanted to kneel and pay his respects but was stopped by Zhu Yunwen, who said, “Stand properly.”
Ma Sanbao looked at Zhu Yunwen, perplexed.
Zhu Yunwen carefully observed Ma Sanbao, with a fair complexion, a clean-shaven chin, a high forehead, cheeks, and cheekbones, distinct eyebrows and eyes, and large ears.
“How long have you been in the King of Yan’s Residence?” Zhu Yunwen asked.
Ma Sanbao’s voice resounded like a bell as he replied, “Reply to Your Majesty, it has been thirteen years.”
“Come, let’s have a chat. Fourth Uncle, Duke of Wei, you don’t need to come over for now.”
Zhu Yunwen patted Ma Sanbao’s shoulder and called out to the surprised Zhu Di and Xu Huizu, signaling them to stay back. He then led Ma Sanbao to a nearby pavilion, gesturing for him to sit down. However, Ma Sanbao was too anxious and remained standing.
“I wonder, Your Majesty…”
“As-salamu alaykum.”
Zhu Yunwen said calmly.
Ma Sanbao’s eyes widened instantly, and he quickly responded, “Wa ʿalaykumu s-salam.”
Zhu Yunwen smiled. It was indeed him.
The dialogue between the two was indeed a form of communication commonly used among Islamic followers.
Zhu Yunwen said, “Peace be upon you,” and Ma Sanbao replied, “May Peace be upon you.”
Although Zhu Yunwen was not particularly interested in Western religions, being a person from future, he had inevitably come into contact with some aspects of Western religious culture. Whether it was the Christian God, Yahweh, or the Islamic Allah, he had some knowledge of them.
In the worst case, you must have at least tried Lanzhou noodles, right?
Lanzhou noodles are mostly operated by Hui ethnic people, who are followers of Islam and Ma Sanbao shares the same faith.”
“Your, Your Majesty…”
Ma Sanbao began to tremble. For how many years had it been? He had never heard a greeting from a follower of Islam. Who would have expected that this sudden greeting would come from the Emperor of the Ming Empire!
Zhu Yunwen looked at Ma Sanbao before him, his heart filled with excitement. He had finally found a commander for his great maritime era!
However, Ma Sanbao’s past was a painful one.
In the seventeenth year of the Hongwu reign, Fu Youde and Lan Yu launched a campaign in Yunnan. At that time, the ten-year-old Ma Sanbao became a captive. Later, he was castrated and entered the palace to serve.
“I am not a follower of Islam, but I have read the Quran,” Emperor Zhu Yunwen said slowly.
Ma Sanbao became excited. He didn’t expect that the Emperor had actually read the Quran, the holy book of Islam.
“Whether Allah is your God or not, I don’t mind. But from now on, I hope you will follow me and remain loyal to me! I will give you the opportunity to voyage, to make a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca! To fulfill your dreams as a Muslim!” Emperor Zhu Yunwen said sternly.
Ma Sanbao’s breathing became rapid, and his eyes sparkled.
Dreams!
The Emperor supports his dreams!
He can go to sea?
He can go to Mecca?
He can touch the holy stone, and pour out his heart to Allah?
“Are you willing to follow me?” Zhu Yunwen asked.
Ma Sanbao fell to his knees and shouted, “I am willing!”
Zhu Yunwen raised his hand and said, “Rise, for if you are to follow me, your name shall no longer be Ma Sanbao. I grant you the surname Zheng and the name He! You shall enter the Imperial Stables as Seal-holding Eunuch Director!”
“Zheng He!” Ma Sanbao repeated the name and then expressed his gratitude while kneeling, “Thank you, Your Majesty, for bestowing this name upon me!”
Zhu Yunwen burst into laughter, feeling relieved and joyful.
He walked towards Zhu Di and Xu Huizu, saying, “Fourth Uncle, I want this person.”
Zhu Di looked at Ma Sanbao and furrowed his brow. He wondered what had gotten into Zhu Yunwen to snatch his eunuch and bodyguard.
But this time, Zhu Yunwen left no room for negotiation.
The emperor’s want someone, what else he can do, he can only release the person.
Zhu Di reluctantly nodded his head.
Ma Sanbao knelt before Zhu Di and said, “Ma Sanbao is deeply grateful for the care of the King of Yan. I can hardly express my gratitude. I wish the King of Yan prosperity and good health.”
Zhu Di sighed. This bodyguard had earned his trust, but now…
“Fourth Uncle, I have brought Duke of Wei here today because there is something I wish to discuss with you.” Zhu Yunwen said softly.
Zhu Di laughed in an ugly manner, looking at Xu Huizu, wondering what other tricks he had up his sleeve.
Xu Huizu took out a document and handed it to Zhu Di, saying, “This is the policy document of the New Military. It has been implemented in the capital garrison for over a month and has achieved great success. The emperor said that all the military forces in the country belong to the court and should enjoy the same policies, without distinction between internal and external, without distinction between kinship and favoritism.”
Zhu Di took the document and carefully read through it, becoming more and more astonished as he read.
These policies cover logistics, promotions, soldiers themselves, and soldiers’ families, and even include retirement benefits for soldiers!
Any one of these policies is enough to win the hearts of the people!
Once these policies are implemented throughout the Ming Dynasty, all the military forces will undoubtedly be loyal to the court, loyal to Zhu Yunwen!
Who would sacrifice their lives for him anymore in the future?
They will only sacrifice their lives for Zhu Yunwen!
This is not just a policy for the new military, it’s a policy to win over the military!
Soldiers join the army precisely to endure hardships and exchange their labor for a meal, don’t they?
Many people join the military out of necessity, out of livelihood!
But now, once Zhu Yunwen’s new policies for the soldiers spread, being a soldier will no longer be a grueling task, but a satisfying “good job”!
In that case, who will the soldiers be grateful to?
Naturally, it will be Zhu Yunwen, the Jianwen Emperor of the Ming Dynasty!
Even if he raise his arms and shout, even if he break his arm and lose his voice, there are probably very few people willing to join him in rebellion. They might even tie him up and send him straight to Nanjing!
“This… Your Majesty, this policy for the new military, it might consume vast amounts of silver and food. Implementing it could be risky. If we fail to deliver on the promises, won’t it easily lead to mutiny?”
Zhu Di did not allow this policy to be implemented, at least not within his own army!
Otherwise, he wouldn’t have any control over his soldiers!
Zhu Yunwen stood by the pavilion, looking at the nearby lake, and said, “The allocation of silver and food is the responsibility of the Ministry of Revenue. They have discussed it, and they assured me that there won’t be any issues.”
Zhu Di swallowed nervously, glanced at the documents, and continued, “This policy is too generous. It may undermine the soldiers’ willingness to fight to the death. If they become too concerned about preserving their own lives on the battlefield, they may hesitate and become reluctant to advance. What should we do?”
Zhu Yunwen motioned for Liu Changge to bring some stones over, and he said to Zhu Di, “That’s why, in addition to the policy, we need to focus on ideological development. We must make every soldier understand that their battles are fought for the Emperor, for the glory of the Ming Dynasty. Their sacrifices are for the Empire, for this land and its everlasting splendor!”
“Furthermore, I don’t believe that treating them well would make them reluctant to give their all. Are you suggesting that if I sincerely treat fourth uncle well, Fourth Uncle wouldn’t reciprocate? I refuse to entertain such absurdity!,” Zhu Yuanzhang said firmly.
Zhu Di was completely helpless. He looked at the document in his hand, wishing he could tear it apart.
Zhu Di couldn’t bear to imagine the consequences if these policies were to spread. How many of the soldiers under his command would still be loyal to him?
Xu Huizu looked at the silent Zhu Di and said, “These policies have been successful in the capital’s garrison and have gained strong support from the soldiers. They are intended to benefit every soldier of the empire. The Emperor and the Five Army Commandery also unanimously recognize the loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness of the King of Yan. Moreover, as the commander in the north, you hold high prestige. Therefore, they want to entrust this matter to you, overseeing the implementation of the new military policies for the troops around Beiping Prefecture.”
Zhu Di felt a deep sense of resentment. Loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness? High prestige? Wasn’t it just a ploy to prevent him from rebelling, by implementing the new military policies around Beiping Prefecture and undermining his own power?
“I’m afraid I have limited abilities, and such a significant matter should be entrusted to someone more capable…” Zhu Di politely refused.
Zhu Yunwen smiled and said, “Since Fourth Uncle is unwilling, then let’s have the Beiping Commandery’s Ping An handle it. As for the King of Yan’s Three Guards…”
Zhu Di’s eyes widened in shock as he looked at Zhu Yunwen with fear.
Zhu Yunwen tossed a chess piece into the lake and said, “Fourth Uncle will be in charge of it, and I won’t worry about it.”
Zhu Di felt a sense of relief, but he also realized that as Zhu Yunwen’s actions continued to close in, he had lost the ability to resist!
The implementation of the new military policy by Ping An, will inevitably become widely known in Beiping prefecture, and the surrounding guards will likely respond and pledge their allegiance to the court.
In his possession, He was left with the Three Guards of the King of Yan and his personal guards, totaling just over 50,000 troops. Relying on this small force to confront a united and blockading army of 400,000 would surely result in certain death.
Regardless of Zhu Di’s preferences, Zhu Yunwen forcefully pushed for the implementation of the new military policy, with Beiping Prefecture being the top priority.
This is because among the guards in Beiping, although they are supplied by the court, many of them are former subordinates of the King of Yan. Especially the officers and military officials, most of them were promoted by Zhu Di himself. If Zhu Di shows any signs of rebellion, those individuals will likely contribute their forces to support him.
This is something Zhu Yunwen cannot allow. The implementation of the new military policy, the replacement of officers and military officials will be carried out together. At this stage, Zhu Yunwen still gave Zhu Di a significant amount of face. After all, he did not touch the Three Guards of the King of Yan.
On the surface, these guards belong to the King of Yan, but fundamentally, they are troops under the jurisdiction of North Zhili Province. The true command authority lies with the Commander of North Zhili Province. However, according to Zhu Yuanzhang’s system, the King assumes the role of commander.
Apart from the Three Guards of the King of Yan, the King of Yan also has his own personal guards, numbering nearly ten thousand. Zhu Yunwen has also refrained from making any moves against them.
Zhu Yunwen is waiting, waiting for the opportunity to use his power to crush Zhu Di and make him completely submit.

Chapter 23: Zhu Yunwen’s “Banquet to Bestow Titles and Territories”
On the 15th of the eighth month in the 31st year of the Hongwu reign.
Originally on the 15th day, Zhu Yunwen was supposed to hold a court meeting, but he believed that the Mid-Autumn Festival was a time for a family reunion. Therefore, he issued an imperial decree to postpone the court meeting to the following day, the 16th. He also arranged for officials to handle essential and important matters in the morning before returning home to gather with their families.
Not only that but those eunuchs and palace maids who were from nearby areas close to the capital were also allowed to return home to visit their families.
Those who had long distances to travel or had no families to visit would consider the palace their home. Lanterns were hung, decorations were put up, and mooncakes and other treats were distributed to enjoy the Mid-Autumn Festival together with the Emperor and the Empress.
Early in the morning, Ma Enhui started bustling around, arranging the palace maids to prepare for the family banquet in the palace.
Although Zhu Yunwen wanted to sleep a little longer, he was awakened by Ma Enhui and called upon the palace maids to dress in court attire. He was informed that he would receive congratulations in the Hall of Central Harmony and Hall of Supreme Harmony.
It was a time of elaborate ceremonies and rituals.
Zhu Yunwen didn’t like it, but he had to accept these rituals because they played a crucial role in the governance of the Ming Empire.
When the rituals crumble, it becomes a sign of the downfall of a nation.
The order of the court, the hierarchy of officials, and their conduct are all tied to these rituals.
What clothes to wear, which belt to match, how to speak when encountering the living, how to wail when facing the dead—all of these have prescribed manners.
Making a mistake is not simply met with a disapproving glance or a reprimand. It could lead to impeachment, a reduction in salary, or even severe punishment such as dismissal from office or execution.
Being in ancient times, it was necessary to adhere to the customs and rituals of that era. One couldn’t be too outrageous or proclaim ideas of individual liberation and freedom in dressing, as it would invite severe criticism…
In the Hall of Central Harmony.
Ma Enhui, along with Zhu Yunwen’s younger brothers, Zhu Yunteng, Zhu Yunjian, and Zhu Yunxi, as well as all the eunuchs and officials from the harem, knelt and paid their respects to Zhu Yunwen.
“In this golden autumn season, we congratulate Your Majesty and celebrate the glory of the Ming Empire. May Your Majesty enjoy good health and well-being, and may the nation of Great Ming be prosperous and the people live in peace..”
Ma Enhui performed the ritual with utmost reverence.
After receiving the congratulations and well-wishes from the crowd, Zhu Yunwen stepped forward to assist Ma Enhui and gestured for everyone to rise. He then spoke, “Today, on this Mid-Autumn Festival, I also wish for all of you to work together in harmony, with unity and virtue, to contribute to the prosperity of our Great Ming Dynasty.”
The people were filled with enthusiasm and expressed their determination not to disappoint the Emperor’s high expectations.
“What is this?” After signaling for everyone to leave, Zhu Yunwen noticed a memorial on the table and couldn’t help but ask.
Ma Enhui smiled and said, “Your Majesty, these are the gifts from the princes. Here is also a list of guests for the family banquet. I seek your decision on this.”
Zhu Yunwen picked up the memorial and unfolded it, and he burst into laughter.
Among the gifts from the Kings, the offerings from Zhu Di, the King of Yan, and Zhu Zhi, the King of Liao, were the most significant. Looking at the densely recorded details on them, it was needless to say that both of them had emptied their treasuries.
Zhu Di’s emphasis on the gifts was understandable to Zhu Yunwen. After all, the series of actions were directed toward Zhu Di, and he felt the pressure. Expressing loyalty and willingness to submit in this manner was reasonable.
However, Zhu Zhi, the King of Liao, also presented such lavish gifts was somewhat surprising.
However, benefits are still needed. Now, training the new army requires a significant amount of financial and logistical support. Although he had reduced the expenses by disbanding 100,000 troops, relying solely on savings is far from enough to sustain the new army.
The key lies in generating additional resources. These gifts are valuable, and he can keep some as reserves while selling the rest.
“As for the family banquet guest list, you can decide.”
Zhu Yunwen went to pay respects to Empress Dowager Lu, exchanged a few words, and then left.
In the evening, Zhu Yunwen hosted a family banquet at the Shenggong Hall to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival. He invited his uncles, brothers-in-law, brothers, and relatives to attend.
Accompanied by music and ceremony, Zhu Yunwen took his seat and gestured for everyone to rise, he said, “This is the Mid-Autumn Festival family banquet, and all of you are my family. Please rise.”
“Thank you, Your Majesty.”
Everyone stood up.
“We congratulate Your Majesty on this auspicious occasion of the Mid-Autumn Festival. May the moon shine brightly, bringing peace and prosperity to the people of Great Ming. May the civil and martial aspects of the empire flourish, and its reputation spread across the four seas. We wish Your Majesty good health and smooth endeavors in all matters.”
Zhu Di, as the head of the vassal kings, led everyone in offering their congratulations.
Zhu Yunwen smiled and once again asked everyone to rise before taking his seat.
“Since my ascension to the throne, this is the first time I have held a family banquet to entertain my uncles and brothers. Although it coincides with the Mid-Autumn Festival, a time for a family reunion, but mourning period has already passed, and uncles are about to depart for the distant borderlands. I feel a deep sense of reluctance.”
Zhu Yunwen expressed his genuine emotions.
Zhu Di, the King of Yan, and the King of Ning were suddenly taken aback. From Zhu Yunwen’s words, it seemed that he didn’t want everyone to go to their respective fiefs.
Zhu Zhi, the King of Liao, looked at Zhu Yunwen and after a moment, he spoke, “Your Majesty’s concern is the foundation of human emotions. I have a thought, but I’m not sure if it’s appropriate to bring it up?”
Zhu Zhi, the fifteenth son of Zhu, was granted the title of King of Liao and fief in Guangning, which is near the Yiwulu Mountain in present-day Beizhen City.
Zhu Yunwen looked at his uncle, who was only twenty-one years old and of similar age to himself and smiled, saying, “During a family banquet, there’s nothing that can’t be said. Please, go ahead and share your thoughts.”
“Your Majesty, the winters in Guangning are extremely harsh, with biting cold winds that seem endless. I truly do not wish to stay in Guangning and would like to earnestly request Your Majesty to grant me a different fief…”
Zhuzhi was not joking.
The winters in Liaodong were bitterly cold and living conditions were difficult.
He was born in Nanjing, and he had yet to fully enjoy the beautiful scenery of Jiangnan before being sent to this inhospitable and frigid region at the age of fifteen or sixteen. Though it was an impressive position to command tens of thousands of troops at such a young age, prestige alone could not satisfy one’s hunger.
Whenever there is a military report, he has to crawl out like a dog, trembling with fear. Sometimes he can’t even get a peaceful night’s sleep. He has been longing for the days in the capital all these years.
Taking advantage of his father, Zhu Yuanzhang passing away, he returned to the capital for the funeral, the stark contrast in lifestyles made him completely fed up with Liaodong. He has made up his mind that even if the Emperor wants him to be stationed there, He will pretend to be ill and stay behind.
“Uncle Liao is like a mountain and a pillar of the empire in Liaodong. Grandfather personally appointed uncle, how could I change that……” said Zhu Yunwen pretending to be hesitant.
No wonder Zhu Zhi presented such generous gifts. It turns out he was trying to take the backdoor approach. He’s quite a clever person.
Zhu Zhi quickly complained, recounting the hardships of life in Liaodong. Finally, he fiercely pinched his own thigh, disregarding the etiquette, and pointed at it, claiming it was frostbitten. He insisted that if he were to return, he might lose this leg.
Everyone took a glance and could clearly see the bruise, which didn’t resemble frostbite at all. This guy, even if you are faking it, you should put more effort into it. Besides, during the past few months, you’ve been running around in the capital, and everyone knows you’re perfectly fine.
If it weren’t for filial piety, you would have caused quite a few troubles by now.
Zhu Yunwen looked at Zhu Zhi’s earnest gaze, sighed, and said, “Since that’s the case, then Uncle Liao will stay in the capital for now to recuperate. As for the fiefdom, let’s change it to Songjiang Prefecture.”
Songjiang Prefecture!
The other vassal kings were suddenly taken aback.
Songjiang Prefecture was known for its fertile land, abundant resources, and beautiful scenery. It had been an important source of revenue for various dynasties throughout history.
During the Yuan Dynasty, Songjiang Prefecture was known as the “Land of Fish and Rice.”
During the Ming Dynasty, Songjiang was highly valued. According to the statistics from the twenty-fourth year of the Hongwu reign (1391) in the Ming Dynasty, the cultivated land in Songjiang Prefecture covered an area of 47,605 hectares, with an annual tax revenue of 1.4 million shi, Although this data reflects the heavy tax burden, it also indicates the abundant agricultural production in Songjiang.
In addition to the continuous cultivation of cotton, mulberry, and rice, the development of reclaimed land, and its rich resources, the region enjoys thriving commerce. To its west lies the nearby city of Suzhou, and to the southwest is Hangzhou. It is also within a distance of merely eight hundred li from the capital city of Nanjing.
Such a prosperous and important region, and yet the Emperor granted it to the King of Liao, Zhu Zhi!
朱植 felt a sense of surrealism and pinched himself to confirm that it wasn’t a dream. He quickly knelt down and expressed his gratitude, saying, “Thank you for your heavenly grace, Your Majesty!”
Many of the other princes looked on with envy at the delighted Zhu Zhi.
However, the King of Yan, Zhu Di, the King of Ning, Zhu Quan, and others, felt extreme fear.
If Zhu Yunwen were to follow in the footsteps of Emperor Taizu of the Song Dynasty, “relinquished military power over a cup of wine”, and stage a similar play of “changing fiefdoms” during the family banquet, should they agree or not?
If they agreed, they wouldn’t even have to return to their fief!
They could simply hand over their military powers and relocate to the southern regions!
If they were to refuse, the Emperor would likely wonder, “What do you mean? You don’t want to be close to me? You don’t want to enjoy wealth and prosperity and instead want to resort to violence?”
Zhu Geng, the King of Min, saw how Zhu Zhi had benefited and couldn’t help but recall his own days of hardship, eating sand in Gansu and enduring the harsh conditions of the wild lands in Yunnan. He was only twenty years old and had already suffered so much. Now that he had the opportunity to change it all, how could he not seize it?
He managed to find a piece of ginger from somewhere and discreetly rubbed it on his eyes, causing tears to flow uncontrollably. He cried out, “Your Majesty, I also want to change my fiefdom…”
However, Zhu Yunwen didn’t allow it, stating that Yunnan couldn’t do without the King of Min.
Zhu Geng couldn’t stop crying, as he really didn’t want to stay in Yunnan anymore. He was willing to endure the humiliation for the sake of his future happiness.
During the Ming Dynasty, Yunnan was far from the picturesque tourist destination it is in modern times, where people flock with bundles of money.
In those days, Yunnan was not only backward but also difficult to govern. The native people were not easily controlled. Today they captured a few elephants to rebel, and tomorrow they make a few spears and rob some food, Killing people was quite common.
Moreover, even in the 21st century, there are still many impoverished areas in Yunnan, let alone during the early Ming Dynasty over six hundred years ago!
Zhu Yunwen had enough and waved his hand, saying, “Alright, alright, I agree.”
Zhu Geng immediately stopped crying and thanked him, wearing a smile with tears on his face. He couldn’t help it, he had used too much ginger.
Zhu Yunwen looked at the others. Without waiting for a response from Zhu Di, Zhu Quan, Zhu Gui, Zhu Yang, and others, Zhu Yunwen spoke first, saying, “Uncles, let’s not think about changing fiefdoms. The Ming Empire still needs uncles to guard it so that I can sleep peacefully.”
“Your Majesty…” Zhu Quan gritted his teeth and shouted, “I don’t want to be far away from the capital. Please grant me your favor.”
“Uncle Ning, I just said not to think about changing fiefdoms,” Zhu Yunwen frowned and said seriously, “I need you to guard the Ming Empire. This is a family banquet. By agreeing to the requests of the King of Liao and the King of Min, I am already uneasy. If we continue like this, how will the empire’s borders fare?”
Zhu Qian could only retract his words, and Zhu Di and others also felt relieved.
As for Zhu Shangbing, the King of Qin, he was just an eight-year-old child and didn’t care much about such matters.
As for Zhu Jixi, the King of Jin, although he was in his twenties, he was still a second-generation prince.
Their father had passed away early, and the two of them had little prestige in the military. They had already held hands and entered the palace a few days ago, seeking Empress Dowager’s help to allow them to stay in the capital.
Zhu Yunwen, seeing that Empress Dowager had spoken, naturally agreed, but it was not announced publicly.
As a result, three of the nine Great Border Kings in the north were gone: Zhu Zhi, the King of Liao; Zhu Shangbing, the King of Qin; and Zhu Jixi, the King of Jin. There were still six remaining Great Border kings!
These remaining kings were the most troublesome ones!
As for Zhu Geng, the King of Min in Yunnan, he was not considered a threat. Changing his fiefdom was just going with the flow.

Chapter 24: Startled Zhu Di
A forced landing is prone to problems, while a soft landing is the proper way.
When Emperor Jianwen ascended the throne in history, within a few months, he resorted to drastic measures. He demoted the King of Zhou to a commoner and later took action against the King of Qi, Xiang, and Dai, stripping them of their titles and reducing them to commoners.
King of Xiang had no way to defend himself and burned himself to death!
Despite such a tragic incident, Emperor Jianwen remained unmoved. He subsequently placed the King of Qi and the King of Dai under house arrest and further demoted the king of Min to a commoner.
Zhu Di, with no way out, rebelled under the banner of ” defending the righteous cause and stabilizing the kingdom.” After four years, he successfully overthrew Emperor Jianwen and ascended the throne in Nanjing.
This time, Zhu Yunwen learned from the lessons of history. He decided not to forcefully strip the kings of their titles but rather let them voluntarily request to be demoted and relocated. Wouldn’t that be better?
By handling the matter openly in front of everyone, no one could find fault. Moreover, the outcome of relocation would be much better for them than remaining in their desolate border territories.
Why not enjoy prosperity and be a peaceful regional prince?
For those who are fond of pleasure, take more concubines; for those who desire wealth, acquire more land; for those who enjoy food, indulge in more delicacies.
But as for military power?
That is a path to self-destruction.
Military power must belong to the central authority!
There is no room for negotiation on this matter!
“Come, let us celebrate and drink on this Mid-Autumn Festival.”
Emperor Zhu Yunwen raised his cup, and everyone followed suit.
Setting down his wine cup, with a eunuch refilling it nearby, Zhu Yunwen descended from the platform with a wine cup in his hand and said to the crowd, “This cup of wine, I offer it to Uncle Four alone. Uncle Four, come!”
Zhu Di quickly stood up, expressing his gratitude repeatedly.
Zhu Yunwen smiled and said, “Uncle Four, you have achieved great merits and worked tirelessly. I have witnessed it all. Without your presence in Shuntian[1]TL’s note: He means Shuntian Prefecture and your coordination of the military across the nine borders, I would have restless days and nights. This cup of wine is dedicated to you, Uncle Four.”
“Brother Four, go ahead and drink it.”
King of Dai, Zhu Gui, shouted with a smile.
Zhu Di looked at Zhu Yunwen, and as Zhu Yunwen raised his wine cup when their cups touched, Zhu Di noticed that Zhu Yunwen lowered his cup. He quickly adjusted his cup downwards, lightly touched it, and drank it all in one gulp.
Zhu Yunwen observed this small detail, a smile forming at the corner of his mouth. He then picked up a wine pitcher from the side, intending to pour wine for Zhu Di personally. However, in a moment of carelessness, the wine pitcher slipped from his hand and fell to the ground, spilling wine all over the floor.
The crowd was taken aback.
Shuangxi quickly came forward to clean up the mess and brought a fresh bottle of wine.
With a hint of apology, Zhu Yunwen said, “Fourth Uncle, it was my carelessness. Here, let me fill up your cup. Since the wine has spilled, we can only serve fresh wine now. I hope it suits your taste, Fourth Uncle.”
Zhu Di’s eyes widened in extreme astonishment!
“The wine has spilled, we can only serve fresh wine now.” These were the words spoken by Li Zengzhi to Zhu Di during their secret conversation in Yangzhou Prefecture!
And now, the Emperor himself spoke those exact words!
Could it be that Li Zengzhi was the Emperor’s man, sent to test him?!
The family banquet continued, but Zhu Di felt a chill running through his body. He had lost all interest, his gaze fixed on the gentle smile on Zhu Yunwen’s face. Fear crept over Zhu Di in waves.
He knew his every move!
He knew he had ambitions!
He knew who was on his side!
That’s why he changed the defense of Beiping!
That’s why he transferred Li Jinglong, Xu Zengshou, Li Zengzhi, and others!
That’s why he wants Dao Yan!
That’s why he was preparing to implement the New Military Policy in Beiping Prefecture!
What was he really doing?
Bitterness filled Zhu Di’s mouth as he finally understood!
Zhu Yunwen was using the art of war, seeking to achieve victory without a battle and make him surrender!
What a formidable Zhu Yunwen, what a formidable Jianwen Emperor, what a formidable nephew!
As the family banquet concluded, the various princes departed one by one.
After returning to the King of Yan’s Mansion, Zhu Di shared the events of the family banquet with Zhu Gaochi, Zhu Gaoxu, and others, asking, “What do you all think?”
Zhu Gaoxu stood up angrily and said, “Father, it must be Li Zengzhi who betrayed us! At that time, Qiu Fu was guarding outside, and it was impossible for anyone outside to hear the conversation inside. Apart from Li Zengzhi and Father, no one knew the content of our secret talk!”
“Is it still meaningful to investigate who betrayed us now?”
Zhu Gaochi glared at Zhu Gaoxu and then said to Zhu Di, “Father, the current plan is to conform to the Emperor’s wishes and wait for the opportunity. From the Emperor summoning Dao Yan to the capital to the New Military policy in Beiping Prefecture to the implicit hints during the Mid-Autumn family banquet, it shows that the Emperor is aware of our intentions. However, due to the lack of clear evidence, he has been testing us repeatedly.”
Zhu Di naturally understood this and sighed, “According to your opinion, how should we conform to the Emperor’s wishes?”
Zhu Gaochi solemnly said, “Show loyalty.”
Zhu Di’s pupils slightly contracted. These three words may be easy to say, but they were incredibly difficult to execute!
It was relatively easy to show loyalty in the capital, just say a few words and put on an act.
But how to show loyalty after returning to Beiping Prefecture?
It would involve giving up military power, weakening the army, or implementing the New military policy, but Zhu Di couldn’t choose any of these options!
How could he achieve his great ambitions without an army?
Zhu Gaoxu disagreed with his elder brother’s view and said, “Father, why don’t we return to the capital, raise the banner, and rally the forces under your call? The guards in Beiping Prefecture will surely respond. At that time, we will command an army of a hundred thousand. As long as we convince the King of Ning, King of Gu, and King of Dai, we can control most of the North Zhili. Then we can march south, capture Jinan, Xuzhou, and Yangzhou in one fell swoop, and ultimately seize Nanjing!”
“You seem to have forgotten, little brother, that there are still four hundred thousand troops surrounding Beiping Prefecture!”
Zhu Gaochi retorted sternly.
Zhu Gaoxu sneered, “So what if there are four hundred thousand troops? Without competent generals, no matter how numerous the soldiers are, they are just useless. Ping’an and Qu Neng may have some abilities, but they are no match for Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng. Moreover, Father has a great reputation from countless battles. Who would dare to challenge us?”
Zhu Gaochi shouted angrily, “You are too naive! The defense of Beiping is most likely completely under Ping’an’s control by now! Ping’an is a cunning person and the Emperor has even given them the authority to appoint military officers. Once they replace our people with their own, who will obey our commands?”
“Even if we control Beiping Prefecture, the New Military Policy will undoubtedly be implemented before we arrive. Do you think the guards will risk their lives to fight or enjoy the benefits of the New Military Policy? Without these people, where will we get our hundred thousand soldiers?”
“And furthermore, if we rush into action, the provisions, horses, and weapons are not yet ready. How can we proceed? Are we going to eat the people? Without the support of the people, how far can we go? The Jianwen Emperor holds the world in his hands. Do you think he will sit idly by?”
Zhu Gaoxu was about to refute Zhu Gaochi, but Zhu Di slammed the table and shouted, “Enough!”
There was a hint of unwillingness in Zhu Di’s eyes as he said, “Let’s discuss this matter further once we return to our fiefdoms.”
Hall of Martial Valor.
Zhu Yunwen was not lying drunk, but instead reviewing memorials from various regions. Fortunately, there were no major events during this period, and the country was in a state of peace and prosperity.
Shuangxi approached and reported, “Your Majesty, Zheng He from the Imperial Stables has arrived.”
Zhu Yunwen raised his eyebrows slightly and instructed Shuangxi to bring him in.
Zheng He entered the hall, paid his respects, and said, “Your Majesty, it is indeed possible to build large seafaring ships at the Longjiang Shipyard. However, we still have a shortage of shipbuilders. It may take several years to build large ships and form a substantial fleet.”
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and said, “I have already issued orders to gather shipbuilders and establish shipyards in Suzhou, Songjiang, Zhenjiang, and other places. We will mobilize the nation’s resources to build a fleet for long-distance voyages. Duke Cao’s journey to the South is also for the purpose of preparing for shipbuilding.”
Zheng He quickly responded, “Your Majesty’s considerations are thorough. I have no objections. We will be ready for long-distance voyages in three years!”
Zhu Yunwen frowned slightly, as three years seemed quite distant.
However, the matter of long-distance voyages was complex and required careful planning. It could not be rushed.
“I appoint you as the Deputy Commander of the Navy. You may select ten thousand troops from the navy to form the long-distance voyage fleet and commence training. Inform Commander of Navy, Chen Xuan, that I allow you to choose anyone you need.”
“In addition, begin training in rivers and lakes first, and when the time is right, conduct sea training. Travel south to Guangzhou, engage in round-trip transportation of goods, and experience various storms and waves to cultivate your skills. If you encounter any unsolvable problems, come directly to me.”
Emperor Zhu Yunwen made the arrangements with seriousness.
Zheng He expressed his gratitude and excitement.
The Emperor had considered everything that he had in mind. What more could he ask for?
It was time to prepare for the long-distance voyages.
Zhu Yunwen lowered his head to continue handling the memorials. He seemed to sense something and noticed Shuangxi gazing in the direction where Zheng He had left. He asked, “What are you daydreaming about?”
Shuangxi was suddenly startled and quickly knelt down, begging for forgiveness.
“Alright, I was just asking a question. Just give a proper response, there’s no need to kneel every time,” Zhu Yunwen said with a furrowed brow.
Shuangxi quickly stood up and said, “I am only envious of Zheng He’s ability to oversee construction and command troops. It’s surprising that even a disabled person can make contributions.”
Zhu Yunwen chuckled and said, “In this world, everyone has their own place. Your place is to accompany me faithfully, and his place is to explore new sea routes.”
Shuangxi naturally understood this point.
After handling the memorials, Zhu Yunwen instructed someone to deliver them to the Office of Transmission. He then stretched his somewhat weary body and walked out of the Hall of Martial Valor with Shuangxi by his side.
The full moon hung high in the sky, casting its bright and serene light over the grand palace of the Great Ming.
The tranquil and cool autumn night brought a sense of contentment.
Ma Enhui slowly approached and said to Emperor Zhu Yunwen, who was gazing at the moon, “Your Majesty, are you in a poetic mood?”
“A poetic mood?”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Ma Enhui with a bitter smile.
Ma Enhui, slightly intoxicated, gazed at Zhu Yunwen with a hazy look in her eyes and said, “On such a beautiful night, wouldn’t Your Majesty like to compose a poetic verse?”
Zhu Yunwen shook his head helplessly, looked at the moon, and thought for a moment. Here was not the Tang or Song Dynasty where he could borrow poems from Li Bai or Su Shi and pretend to be romantic.
During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, there were not many renowned poets like those in the Tang and Song Dynasties. People from later generations didn’t know much about poets like Song Lian, Liu Ji, and Gao Qi, known as the Three Masters of Early Ming Poetry.
Although later poets like Li Menglong, Wang Shizhen, Li Zhi, Yuan Kai, Wang Fuzhi, Huang Zongxi, and Gu Yanwu had their poetry works passed down, Emperor Zhu Yunwen didn’t remember many of them.
However, there was one poem by Wang Shizhen that suited the current mood.
Emperor Zhu Yunwen shamelessly used it directly, since the Ming Dynasty belonged to him, so what were Wang Shizhen’s poems? Moreover, there are still hundred years before Wang Shizhen born.
“The moon shines brightly, knowing its true essence, regardless of waxing or waning.
Whether it waxes or wanes, let us rejoice in this good season on Earth.
In this good season, may we witness it year after year and always see the Mid-Autumn Moon.”
Zhu Yunwen recited slowly.
Ma Enhui looked at Emperor Zhu Yunwen in astonishment. Although she knew he had some talent, she was still surprised to hear such thought-provoking poetry.
“In this good season, may we witness it year after year and always see the Mid-Autumn Moon. I also have the same wish.”
Ma Enhui said joyfully.
Zhu Yunwen embraced Ma Enhui and looked at the moon, which was currently full, but in a few days, it would begin to wane.

Chapter 25: The Issue of “In prosperity, the people suffer”
The lamp dimmed, and the wine had a slightly intoxicating effect.
On the couch, Zhu Yunwen extended his hand and gently brushed aside the strands of Ma Enhui’s hair that fell on her cheek. Looking into her enchanting eyes, he smiled lightly and said, “You have endured a lot during this period.”
Ma Enhui’s responsibilities as the head of the harem were not light.
Apart from accompanying the empress dowager and taking care of their son, she also had to investigate the affairs of various departments and oversee the implementation of the new policies in the harem. These new tasks brought about many challenges, and Ma Enhui is not reassured and needs to personally inquire.
“I heard that you punished the supervisor of the Laundry Bureau with thirty strokes. What did they do to anger you so much?”
Zhu Yunwen knew Ma Enhui’s gentle nature and that she rarely got angry.
Resting her head against Zhu Yunwen’s arm, Ma Enhui’s lips curved into a slight smile, revealing a hint of her girlish temperament. She said, “Your Majesty proposed the new policies for the harem, and it is my duty to implement them. The other departments and bureaus have been diligent and executed them properly. However, the supervisor of the Laundry Bureau went against the rules. She embezzled ninety percent of the funds allocated, and the dishes served daily barely had any meat, just a hint of meat flavor.”
“Not only that, she even suppressed the maids’ right to visit their families. Unless a maid presents at least two taels of silver as a bribe, without a bribe, the maids would not be allowed to leave the palace until they die. Your Majesty, don’t you think such a supervisor deserves punishment?”
Zhu Yunwen’s gaze turned slightly cold, but then he calmed down and said, “The Laundry Bureau is located near the De Sheng Gate, not within the palace walls. It’s just separated by a wall, yet the supervisor dared to deceive and exploit others, acting recklessly. Then how many more people across the vast land of Ming would deceive, act unlawfully, and cause trouble, while I remain unaware, thinking that this realm is peaceful and all its people are safe?”
“It is fortunate that Your Majesty is concerned about the welfare of the people. I believe that under your brilliant leadership, the glorious era of the Han and Tang dynasties can be revived,” Ma Enhui said, both compassionate and admiring.
Zhu Yunwen smiled helplessly, embracing Ma Enhui, his eyes filled with tenderness.
As the night grew quiet, and Ma Enhui fell peacefully asleep, Zhu Yunwen continued to ponder how to establish a truly effective supervision system in this era. He wanted to understand the hardships faced by the common people of Ming.
Those officials would always try to hide information.
Looking at the future, with such advanced means of communication like telephones and the internet, even when dozens of people die in a mining accident, there are still those who manage to cover it up. What more in Ming, where information dissemination is extremely limited?
When there are problems at the local level, officials can easily conceal them. With the emperor far away, there are countless places where no one can keep them in check. A county magistrate can act recklessly and oppress the people without anyone knowing.
Moreover, the people of the Ming are generally honest peasants. As long as they have food to eat, they won’t rebel, even if they are oppressed and left with nothing but tattered clothes. Their first thought wouldn’t be to overthrow the corrupt officials but rather where to seek alms.
Only when we delve into the depths of history, can we truly feel “In prosperity, the people suffer; in decline, the people suffer” deep sorrow.
According to Zhang Yanghao, the common people have never truly experienced good times, which is why he expresses the lament of “prosperity and decline.” If it were in the past, Zhu Yunwen would have merely appreciated Zhang Yanghao’s poetic skills. But now, as the emperor of the Ming Dynasty, he needs to thoroughly address the issue of “In prosperity, the people suffer.”
The vast territory spanning over nine million square kilometers and a population of over sixty million presents numerous challenges, most of which are concentrated among the lower classes. Looking at historical lessons, it is often the lower classes that bear the brunt of the collapse of feudal dynasties.
Regardless of the Chen Sheng-Wu Guang uprising, Old Zhu begging for food, Li Zicheng being unemployed, or Old Jiang moving houses, All of them were instances where there were problems with governance at the lower level.
If lower-level governance is poor, it won’t win the hearts of the people.
Without the hearts of the people, there can be no long-lasting prosperity for the nation.
This is an iron rule of historical development.
Zhu Yunwen pondered, unaware of when he fell asleep, until Ma Enhui nudged him, gently awakening him.
“Your Majesty, it’s time for the morning court.”
Ma Enhui softly called out.
Zhu Yunwen sat up, glanced at the eunuch kneeling in front of him, who was there to request his attendance at the morning court, waved his hand to dismiss him, and with Ma Enhui’s assistance, he put on his court attire.
“Your Majesty, would you like to cancel the morning court today?”
Ma Enhui looked at the weary Zhu Yunwen, speaking with a touch of reproach, as the period of mourning had just ended and he hadn’t yet regained his self-control.
“No need, when I used to stay up all night playing Warcraft…”
“Warcraft?”
“Uh, breaking away from conventional thinking and studying hard, I did it a lot back then. It’s nothing…”
Zhu Yunwen wiped away a cold sweat.
Damn, I’m still not fully awake yet.
The morning court proceeded in an orderly manner, with the cabinet handling the necessary affairs and delegating undecided matters to Zhu Yunwen. Zhu Yunwen, in turn, sought the collective wisdom of the ministers to address those issues.
After everything was resolved, everyone clapped their hands, and the emperor returned to the palace while the ministers went about their official duties.
It seemed like a peaceful day without any disturbances, and Zhu Yunwen was planning to go back and rest. However, unexpectedly, an official stepped forward and shouted loudly, “I have a memorial!”
Zhu Yunwen squinted his eyes and looked over, only to see a young man in his twenties kneeling on the ground.
“Present your memorial,” commanded the internal supervisor, glancing at Zhu Yunwen’s expression.
“I, Supervising Secretary of the office for scrutiny for war, Cheng Ji, impeach Li Zengzhi, the front army commandery Left Commisioner in chief of twelve crimes!” Cheng Ji raised his memorial high above his head.
The entire court turned their attention to Cheng Ji. Among the civil officials, many were gloating, while the martial officials and nobility wore displeased expressions.
Although Li Zengzhi had committed numerous wrongdoings, he was still a member of the martial officials, and as the saying goes, “Shared honor, shared disgrace.” Hitting Li Zengzhi’s face would reflect poorly on the entire martial officials and nobility.
Xu Huizu, in particular, looked at Cheng Ji with a hint of anger.
Li Zengzhi just left the capital, and you impeach him afterward. What does that mean?
Where were you earlier?
Even if you have evidence, Li Zengzhi has already fled thousands of miles away. Whom are you going to inquire with?”
The internal supervisor handed Cheng Ji’s memorial to Zhu Yunwen. Zhu Yunwen opened and read it, and he was secretly surprised. Conspiracy, collusion with vassal kings, raising private soldiers and forming secret alliances.
It’s really convenient to come up with any accusations to make someone die quickly.”
And there’s even one more accusation that during the mourning period, Li Zengzhi visited the Department of Entertainment and even physically assaulted someone there.
Well done.
During the mourning period, even I had to endure, but you, Li Zengzhi, had a great time gallivanting around freely.
“Do you have concrete evidence for these twelve accusations?” Zhu Yunwen asked.
“If I speak falsely, I am willing to accept any punishment,” Cheng Ji quickly replied.
Zhu Yunwen chuckled. He knew that the accusations in Cheng Ji’s memorial were indeed true. However, he couldn’t allow Li Zengzhi to die at the moment. After all, how could Li Jinglong be of service to him if that happened?
“For now, let’s set this matter aside. We will inquire further when the Left Commisioner in chief returns to the capital,” Zhu Yunwen said as he stood up.
“Court End.”
The internal supervisor announced the end of the court session.
The civil and military officials knelt and performed their salutations.
Zhu Yunwen returned to the harem and handed Cheng Ji’s memorial to Liu Changge, saying, “Send someone to deliver this memorial to Li Zengzhi.”
Liu Changge hurriedly made the arrangements.
Zhu Yunwen’s lips curved into a faint smile. Li Zengzhi was devoted to Zhu Di, and now his fate was in Zhu Yunwen’s hands. However, Zhu Yunwen didn’t intend to harm him. Instead, he wanted to make it clear to Li Zengzhi that his only way out was to submit to him.
Of course, it wasn’t just Li Zengzhi who would be affected. There was also Li Jinglong.
Hall of Martial Valor, Xie Jin requests an audience.
Zhu Yunwen signed a memorial and said, “The Ministry of Revenue has been facing difficulties recently.”
Xie Jin’s expression turned bitter as he quickly replied, “Your Majesty, the policies of the New Military have been implemented nationwide, and the expenses are not small. Coupled with the policies of light burdens and low taxes, the Ministry of Revenue will face even greater challenges in the coming year.”
Zhu Yunwen didn’t take it seriously and said, “The empire is always advancing, and it requires both resourcefulness and thrift. Currently, there are too many officials and the bureaucracy is bloated. This cannot continue.”
Xie Jin clearly understood the situation. During the reign of Zhu Yuanzhang, the power was often decentralized and divided among various institutions. The result was the creation of three separate management bodies: the Provincial Administration Commission, the Provincial Surveillance Commission, and the Regional Military Commission.
You restrain me, I restrain him. He restrains you. Everyone had their checks and balances, and no one could overpower others or exert control.
If the relationship was good, a meeting and a drink could resolve the issue if there was a mutual agreement.
But if the relationship was bad, even if you begged and pleaded, they would ignore you. They would simply raise their heads and say, “I don’t agree. What can you do about it?”
According to the regulations, you really couldn’t do anything.
Your administration commission is responsible for handling refugees, what? You need military help, why would we help you?
Who do you think you are?
Without an imperial order, not a single soldier will be dispatched on your behalf!
With more institutions, naturally, there would be more officials.
After all, you couldn’t be a general without an army. Had a relative at home? Come, come to work. What? Your wife’s family’s second aunt even has a dog? Bring it here to guard the office.
Having more people was good. Someone in front yelled to open the way, and some people in the back surrounded them for protection so awe-inspiring.
But with more people, the expenses of the court also increased. After all, salaries had to be paid, although Old Zhu had set the salaries low…
In one place, the chief officials and officials of various bureaus alone numbered in the hundreds, and when you added officials at all levels, there were at least a few thousand.
The base number was large, so even when multiplied by a small figure, it still became a significant number.
Zhu Yunwen had always wanted to change this, but he was troubled by the fact that he had only ascended the throne recently. Making significant changes involving so many people would easily lead to problems.
Xie Jin understood Zhu Yunwen’s intention and said, “Your Majesty, streamlining the institutions is feasible, but we mustn’t rush it. I believe that the most urgent matter is the issue of the Vassal kings.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Xie Jin and slowly asked, “Do you think the King of Yan will make a move?”
Xie Jin’s expression turned serious, and after deep thought, he said, “Your Majesty, King of Yan is not an easily subdued person. Once he returns to Beiping Prefecture, he will surely stir up trouble.”
“Oh? Even with this layout, he still dares to take action?” Zhu Yunwen looked at Xie Jin with great interest.
Xie Jin nodded heavily and said, “Your Majesty, the King of Yan has a strong grasp of military affairs. If he finds an opportunity, he will launch a swift attack. You should know that the King of Yan has not been afraid of taking risks in the past.”
Zhu Yunwen paced and contemplated in the Hall of martial valor.
Xie Jin’s concerns were not unfounded. Zhu Di has a big ambition and he was the son of Zhu Yuanzhang. While Zhu Yunwen was merely Zhu Yuanzhang’s grandson.
Zhu Di refused to acknowledge Zhu Yunwen.
He yearned to seize the throne and claim what he believed was his rightful and supreme power.
However, after Zhu Yunwen’s numerous actions, did Zhu Di still have the courage to oppose him?
“He is not lacking in courage!”
Zhu Yunwen furrowed his brow, then turned to Shuangxi and said, “Summon the King of Ning.”
Confused, Xie Jin looked at Zhu Yunwen, but Zhu Yunwen smiled calmly, assuring him there was no need to be nervous.
Zhu Di’s personal forces alone were insufficient to accomplish great things. He needed allies, and his ally was Zhu Quan, the King of Ning.
However, at present, Zhu Yunwen intended to completely subjugate Zhu Quan and make him serve himself!

Chapter 26: Palace encounter between Zhu Yunwen and King of Ning
King of Ning, Zhu Quan, the 17th son of Zhu Yuanzhang, in the 24th year of the Hongwu reign, was granted the fief of Great Ning.
The region of Ning was located outside the Xifeng Pass, belonging to the ancient Huizhou territory. It bordered Liaodong to the east and Xuanfu to the west, serving as a crucial stronghold in the You-Yan region.
There was a reason why Zhu Yuanzhang entrusted such an important stronghold to Zhu Quan.
When Cai Dongfan, the esteemed author of the “Ming Tongjian,” wrote about this, he made the following assessment: ‘Among the offspring of the Great Ancestor, the Prince of Yan excels in warfare, while the Prince of Ning excels in strategy.’
According to Cai Dongfan[1]Cai Dongfan (Chinese: 蔡东藩; Wade–Giles: Ts’ai Tung-fan; July 23, 1877 – March 5, 1945), was a Chinese historian and prolific writer of historical novels.’s evaluation: “Among the offspring of the Taizu, the King of Yan excelled in warfare, while the King of Ning excelled in strategy.”
In other words, according to Cai Dongfan’s judgment, Zhu Di, such a schemer, and rebel was only skilled in warfare, while the Prince of Ning was truly a person of great wisdom and strategy.
In fact, directly interpreting the text is one-sided.
Beyond the term ‘skilled,’ there are other abilities intertwined.
King of Ning not only possessed vast intelligence and strategy but was also a brave and skilled warrior. He had repeatedly joined forces with other frontier kings, exerting his dominance in the northern wilderness.
Eighty thousand archers and six thousand war chariots!
That was the true strength of Zhu Quan!
And mind you, those eighty thousand were all mounted troops! Furthermore, they consisted mainly of Mongolian mercenaries known as the famous Duoyan Three Guards, whose combat capabilities were unparalleled in the Ming Dynasty!
Side hall.
After the King of Ning Zhu Quan paid his respects, Zhu Yunwen smiled and asked Shuangxi and the others to leave. He then sat down and said to Zhu Quan, “Uncle Ning, before parting, I summoned you to the palace because I have some concerns and hope that Uncle Ning can help me.”
Zhu Quan, who was only twenty years old, had fair skin and a long beard, exuding an air of elegance. Seeing Zhu Yunwen speaking in a calm manner, without the airs of an emperor, he also relaxed and said lightly, “The affairs of the Emperor are the affairs of the Ming Dynasty and the subjects. Whatever Your Majesty entrusts, I dare not refuse.”
Zhu Yunwen held a tea bowl, gently savored its aroma, and said, “I wonder, Uncle Ning, how do you view the King of Yan?”
Zhu Quan was suddenly startled, looking at the calm Zhu Yunwen, his vigilance grew, and he replied, “The King of Yan is a pillar in the northern part of the empire, possessing both strategy and courage. He excels in military affairs and is unmatched in his swift movements. There are few who can rival him.”
“Hehe, this evaluation is quite accurate. However, the more so, the more uneasy I become.”
Zhu Yunwen took out the confidential report written by Li Jinglong. Zhu Quan respectfully received the secret report, returned to his position, and opened it. His face instantly turned pale.
Although Li Jinglong primarily focused on Zhu Di, even implicating Xu Huizu, he also indirectly involved himself!
This traitor!
He actually betrayed me and the King of Yan!
Li Jinglong, from this day forward, there is no reconciliation between you and me!
What else is there to say!
Zhu Quan hurriedly knelt down and exclaimed, “Your Majesty, I have no ulterior motives. These are fabricated words by Li Jinglong…”
“I wasn’t referring to you, but to the King of Yan,” Zhu Yunwen asked in a stern voice.
At this moment, Zhu Quan had no intention of worrying about the King of Yan. He continued, “Your Majesty, I have been feeling unwell lately and would like to stay in the capital to seek medical advice. As for Great Ning, I kindly request that Your Majesty select another capable general…”
The best way to ensure one’s safety was to stay under the Emperor’s watchful eye. In Ming Dynasty, distance only increased suspicion, not favor.
If, while he was fighting outside, some minister accused him of having excessive troops, colluding with the Five Army commandery, and having malicious intentions, he wouldn’t even have a chance to explain himself.
Better to relocate fief, resolutely relocate the fief!
Zhu Quan felt anxious and uneasy.
Zhu Yunwen approached and helped Zhu Quan to his feet, smiling as he said, “Uncle Ning, if I didn’t trust you, why would I bring out this confidential report? I am well aware of your actions in Great Ning. Sigh…”
Zhu Quan thought himself, to trust him meant not trusting the fourth brother, Zhu Di?
As he heard the Emperor sigh, he wondered if the Emperor worried about the Fourth brother rebelling.
That couldn’t be, right? Although fourth brother was fierce, he wouldn’t be foolish enough to seek his own death.
After all, there were four hundred thousand troops in the capital, plus another four hundred thousand around Beiping Prefecture, not to mention the garrisons in other places and the Navy.
“Your Majesty, I am willing to share your worries!” Zhu Quan gritted his teeth.
Better for you to die than me[2]TL’s note: This is Chinese Idiom 死道友不死贫道, Fourth Brother, I’m sorry, I was forced into this too. If you want to blame someone, blame that shameless traitor Li Jinglong.
Zhu Yunwen looked at Zhu Quan and burst into laughter, saying, “Sharing worries? Let’s forget about that for now. How about we deduce the situation in Beiping for the next year?”
“Deduce?” Zhu Quan was puzzled.
Could this thing be deduced too?
My lord Emperor, do you think you’re Zhuge Liang, capable of deducing the world divided by three from a straw-thatched cottage? This is the Great Ming Palace we’re talking about…
Zhu Yunwen walked to the table, unrolled a scroll, revealing a map of Great Ming, and picked up a bamboo stick. He pointed to the location of Beiping Prefecture on the map and said to Zhu Quan, “The King of Yan possesses remarkable talent and great ambition. Considering our family relationship, I have been on guard and deployed troops to Beiping, with the sole purpose of the King of Yan’s loyalty.”
“However, ambition is like a raging fire, difficult to extinguish. I am deeply worried. It’s only the two of us now, so I’ll be frank. If the King of Yan truly has ulterior motives, how do you think he would act?”
As Zhu Quan looked at the map and listened to Zhu Yunchuan’s words, he almost wanted to pray for the King of Yan. The rebellion hadn’t even started, and the Emperor had already concluded that you would rebel and even planned to deduce how you would rebel.
Fourth brother, your life is too miserable…
“Your Majesty wants to know how Fourth brother, I mean, King of Yan, would act?”
Unable to do otherwise, Zhu Quan went along with it.
Zhu Yunwen pointed to the location of Beiping Prefecture and said, “The King of Yan won’t simply take action without careful planning. First, he will gather weapons and provisions, and train his troops. As for soldiers and provisions, they are relatively easy to handle. But weapon production requires some movement. Therefore, he will arrange for people to dig tunnels in the King of Yan’s residence to secretly manufacture weapons. On the surface, he will raise poultry to cover up the activities…”
Zhu Quan’s mouth twitched slightly. Such methods, the emperor can figure it out?
Zhu Yunwen continued, “To buy more time and alleviate my concerns, he will employ a ruthless tactic…”
“Uh? What tactic?” Zhu Quan looked at Zhu Yunwen in astonishment.
Zhu Yunwen chuckled and said, “Without relinquishing military authority, how else could he make me dismiss my worries? It could be that he pretends to be severely ill, seriously injured, or even… insane.”
“Insane? Mad?” Zhu Quan widened his eyes as if listening to a story.
However, the storytelling skills of the Emperor seem to be quite poor.
You see, Zhu Di is known for his bravery and can easily ride a horse for hundreds of miles. Would such a strong man really go mad?
Zhu Yunwen smiled calmly and said, “Of course, there are many people who feign madness to avoid calamity, such as Sun Bin, Sima Yi, and Tang Bohu…”
“Wait, Your Majesty, I know about Sun Bin and Sima Yi, but who is Tang Bohu?”
Zhu Quan, considering himself a scholar with extensive knowledge, had never heard of anyone named Tang Bohu in history.
Zhu Yunwen felt frustrated.
You may not know who Tang Bohu is, but your great-grandson Zhu Chenhao does. 
However, if he changes history, Zhu Quan doesn’t go to Nanchang, then his great-grandson won’t have the opportunity to rebel, and Tang Bohu won’t have the chance to feign madness.
Zhu Yunwen didn’t know how many unpredictable events will happen because of his action. Will those amazing and brilliant figures in history still appear?
As an emperor, where will the Ming Dynasty go?
Can he really handle this colossal wheel of fate?
Zhu Yunwen’s eyes gradually grew determined as he glared at Zhu Quan and continued, “The King of Yan will seek opportunities and buy time. And his biggest opportunity is not to seize the north area of North Zhili, but you!”
Zhu Quan was startled and exclaimed, “Me?”
Zhu Yunwen smiled and pointed in the direction of Great Ning, saying, “I have made countless arrangements in Beiping, and the only loophole is you.”
Zhu Quan’s soul was nearly scared out of his body. He quickly kneeled down and shouted, “Your Majesty, I am fully devoted to the imperial court and have no ulterior motives. I humbly request Your Majesty’s permission to change my fief to Jiangnan and find a place to settle down for the rest of my life.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at the map and ignored Zhu Quan who was kneeling. He continued, “The King of Yan will secretly send people to find you or come personally, and he will use a scheme to take away your Duo Yan three guards, forcing you to accompany him south. This will break the siege of Beiping and allow him to acquire most of the territory of North Zhili.”
“Afterward, I will engage in a battle with you. If I win, you guys will die. If I lose, the King of Yan will usurp the throne. As for you? Heh, the best outcome is to be exiled and become a King in captivity.”
Zhu Quan trembled all over. Zhu Yunwen’s words were merciless, directly striking at his heart!
Zhu Yunwen put away the map and looked at the trembling Zhu Quan calmly. He said, “Uncle Ning, I’m telling you all of this because I hope you can stand on the right side. I need you to keep an eye on the King of Yan. If he shows any signs of betrayal, I hope you will perform well.”
Zhu Quan had never felt such fear before, even in the face of thousands of troops.
Zhu Yunwen’s words were direct and life-threatening!
“Please rise, I trust you, and I trust your abilities. Therefore, I will relieve your worries. When you grow old and wish to return, I will give you Shaoxing Prefecture.” Zhu Yunwen bent down and lifted Zhu Quan, speaking to him with seriousness in his voice.
“Shaoxing Prefecture?!”
Zhu Quan was shocked.
Shaoxing Prefecture was a prosperous place, encompassing eight counties including Shanyin, Kuaiji, Shangyu, Xiaoshan, Shengxian, Xinchang, Zhuji, and Yuyao. It was very close to Hangzhou Prefecture.
This place was even better than Songjiang Prefecture!
Such places, The fact that the Emperor promised it to him was unbelievable!
Zhu Quan also understood that as a vassal king always leading a powerful army, he would eventually be dealt with.
During the time of his late father, Zhu Yuanzhang, he had complete trust and no concerns. 
But now, the Emperor was Zhu Yunwen, who might not trust him. It would be better to handle the situation early, return to the south, learn from the King of Liao Zhu Zhi, and become a peaceful vassal king, ensuring a way out for future generations.
“I will follow Your Majesty’s orders in all matters.”
Zhu Quan made up his mind and stood beside Zhu Yunwen. As for his fourth brother Zhu Di, it would be best if he lived a peaceful life. But if what the Emperor said was true, then Zhu Quan wouldn’t hesitate to “sacrifice family for righteousness”!
Zhu Yunwen watched Zhu Quan leave and smiled faintly. Sitting at the desk, he picked up a memorial and read it. Soon, he burst into laughter and issued orders, “Summon Xu Miaojin.”
“Li Zhigang, Guo Lian…”
Su Chang He[3]TL’s note: Author write 苏幕遮, (Su Mu Zhe) in the raw, I think he meant to write Su chang he which is the mc original name, so ill use su chang he recited the names on the list and glanced at Xu Miaojin’s talent report written by Xu Miaojin herself. He couldn’t help but burst into laughter. This girl really had some tricks up her sleeve.
These talents weren’t found; they were tested. It seemed that Xu Miaojin’s reputation for cleverness was well-deserved.

Chapter 27: Using Phytons to select talents…
Xu Miaojin arrived quickly, as she was originally in the harem, keeping Ma Enhui company.
After entering the side hall, Xu Miaojin slightly bent her knees as a gesture of respect, then went directly to Zhu Yunwen and called for Shuangxi to prepare tea. Shuangxi knew that this young lady was not someone to offend, so she promptly attended to her.
“Brother Emperor, are you satisfied with the talents I found?” Xu Miaojin asked proudly.
Zhu Yunwen smiled faintly, glanced at the memorials on the table, and said, “Whether these individuals are useful or not, it is up to them to prove. I’m just curious, how did you manage to accomplish this?”
Zhu Yunwen was aware that no one from the Imperial Academy had cooperated with Xu Miaojin. After all, the students of the Imperial Academy were quasi-government officials, and they couldn’t afford to collaborate with a young girl.
Zhu Yunwen was well aware of the incidents where Xu Miaojin was constantly being laughed at by the Imperial Academy. However, in Zhu Yunwen’s view, it wasn’t a bad idea to let Xu Miaojin liven up the monotonous life at the Imperial Academy, Living a lively and busy life can actually be quite good.
To prevent her from developing the notion of “finding solace in solitude, detached from worldly glory and wealth,” it would be a waste of life for such an extraordinary woman to enter the monastery, spending her days in meditation and devotion.
Wouldn’t it be better for her to shine and make great achievements in the field of education for women in the Ming Dynasty, creating a legendary legacy?
Xu Miaojin took a sip of tea and said with a playful smile, “I have plenty of ways. Li Zhigang is resourceful, Guo Lian has a wide network, and Wang Huai is courageous and valiant… If Brother Emperor values them, they will certainly achieve great feats.”
“Haha, you spent over a month meticulously selecting and screening and finally came up with ten names. If I don’t make use of them, wouldn’t it disappoint you? Very well, let Li Zhigang become Junior Historiography Compiler in the Hanlin Academy, Guo Lian as Secretary of the Bureau of Evaluations in the Ministry of Personnel, and Wang Huai enter the Bureau of Military appointments in the Ministry of War…”
Zhu Yunwen directly appointed ten students from the Imperial Academy.
Seeing Zhu Yunwen acting swiftly and decisively, Xu Miaojin was also taken aback and quickly asked, “Brother Emperor, won’t you observe and assess these individuals anymore?”
“I trust you,” Zhu Yunwen said earnestly.
Xu Miaojin looked at Zhu Yunwen, her eyes showing some changes. It turned out that he truly believed in her, believed that she could accomplish great things and contribute her utmost to the Ming Dynasty.
“Have you seen enough?” Zhu Yunwen asked, thinking that there might be cinnabar powder on his face as Xu Miaojin kept staring at him.
Xu Miaojin quickly lowered her head, her face slightly blushing, and said, “What about the Women’s Academy?”
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and said, “The Women’s Academy needs to be established, of course. But are you prepared?”
Xu Miaojin looked up at Zhu Yunwen, only to see a serious expression on his face.
No one cared about women’s education.
Xu Miaojin understood this deeply. She was fortunate because she had been cherished by her brothers and had learned some knowledge. But women from some noble families could only recognize a few characters and barely understand account books. If conditions allowed, they might even learn poetry and cultivate their sentiments.
However, knowledge of governance and the world was not something men allowed women to learn. Even if they did learn, they couldn’t speak about it or discuss it.
Women are not allowed to participate in politics, and this rule applies not only in the palace but also in noble households.
Even if she were to marry a nobleman in the future, she cannot violate this rule. It would be best for her to pretend to be foolish and ignorant when her husband talks about matters, or better yet, actually be a fool.
Because there is nothing to say.
Because our words don’t match.
Because even words of concern could be wrong.
By then, she would only be left with solitude and coldness, day after day, repeating a numbness like a walking corpse, without personal emotions or thoughts.
Xu Miaojin doesn’t want to live such a life, nor does she want countless women to live such a life.
However, this is an insurmountable mountain!
She alone cannot overcome it!
Even if Zhu Yunwen nodded, it may not be possible to implement it truly because the Grand Secretariat will oppose it, the Six Ministries will oppose it, and all officials will oppose it!
And by then, she would be facing almost all the power in the court alone!
Can she bear it?
But Xu Miaojin knows that if she retreats now, the Women’s Academy may never be able to appear again! And the door for women to change their fate will be completely closed!
Is it worth taking such great risks for those unrelated people?
Xu Miaojin’s eyes went from uneasy to determined as she said, “I need time. I, Xu Miaojin, will definitely establish the Women’s Academy!”
“Haha, good!” Zhu Yunwen looked at Xu Miaojin with satisfaction and said, “Then let’s do it at the beginning of next year. Three months of preparation should be enough, right?”
Xu Miaojin nodded repeatedly and said, “It’s enough. Thank you, Brother Emperor.”
“Let’s go, back to the palace. Today, I invite you to a meal, but you need to tell me how you selected these talented individuals…”
“Hehe, if I tell you, Brother Emperor, you must not get angry…”
During lunch, Xu Miaojin explained the way she selected talents to Zhu Yunwen and Ma Enhui. Zhu Yunwen nodded repeatedly, and Ma Enhui dropped her chopsticks in surprise several times.
Xu Miaojin grasped the arrogance and contempt of the Imperial Academy scholars and directly told everyone that no one except her could solve this problem.
This infuriated many people, and they decided to take action and “teach a lesson” to Xu Miaojin.
But that was just the beginning. What shocked Ma Enhui the most was that Xu Miaojin, in order to test the bravery of the scholars, locked them in a room and…
Threw a python in.
Ma Enhui felt that the meal wasn’t appetizing anymore. Just imagine the terrifying scene of a group of people looking at the python, screaming in horror. Some possibly faint from fear, and what if it bites someone…
“It won’t bite. Its teeth have been removed.”
Xu Miaojin explained.
Ma Enhui secretly prayed for the scholars in the Imperial Academy. If any of them were played to death by Xu Miaojin, there would be nowhere to reason.
However, Zhu Yunwen agreed with Xu Miaojin’s strategies.
Whether one has the courage or not, it will become apparent when they try. Faced with danger, who would be the first to flee, who would stay in place to think of countermeasures, and who would have already taken action.
It’s clear at a glance, and the results are there.
As for the seven or eight people who fainted and kept having nightmares, and the dozen or so who complained to the chancellor, that is an internal matter of the Imperial Academy and has nothing to do with Zhu Yunwen.
Zhu Yunwen looked at the confident and clever Xu Miaojin and said with a smile, “Instructor Xu is diligent and has made achievements in selecting talents. You can be promoted to the position of Proctor of the Disciplinary Office.”
“Your Majesty!”
Ma Enhui was somewhat anxious.
Xu Miaojin clearly caused trouble, so why is she being promoted?
Moreover, the Proctor of the Disciplinary Office, being inclined towards discipline and guidance, not only has authority over the management of the students but also has the power to administer punishments to the erudite, instructors, and others. If such power were to be entrusted to Xu Miaojin, wouldn’t it be tantamount to setting the Imperial Academy on fire?
Zhu Yunwen signaled Ma Enhui to relax and said to Xu Miaojin, “It’s decided, but I have one condition.”
“Brother Emperor, you’re not asking me to select talents again, are you?”
Xu Miaojin put down her chopsticks and asked.
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and said, “Naturally. Talented individuals are the foundation of the empire. However, in addition to seeking out talents, you also need to observe the Imperial Academy and Identify the ten major shortcomings of the education system in the Imperial Academy..”
“Ten major shortcomings?”
Xu Miaojin and Ma Enhui were both surprised.
How could the Imperial Academy, as the highest educational institution of the Ming Dynasty, have shortcomings?
Zhu Yunwen looked calmly at the two of them and said, “Even the sages know that no one is perfect, so how can the Imperial Academy avoid problems? Find the problems and solve them well, only then can the Imperial Academy truly contribute talented individuals to the court. Otherwise, it will only be empty talk, with officials who rely on past achievements to govern the present. How can the Great Ming Empire be vigorous and create a prosperous era?”
“You will enter the Imperial Academy and, from the methods of education, management, learning, and life, find the problems, and then think of ways to improve them, which you will submit to the Chancellor, the Director of Studies, and me.”
Xu Miaojin quickly stood up and said, “Your Subject understands.”
“also declaring yourself as subject…”
Ma Enhui teased.
Xu Miaojin laughed and said, “Of course, now I am an official of the sixth rank.”
Zhu Yunwen clasped his hands and said, “I’ve met the Proctor of Disciplinary Office.”
“No need for formalities.”
Xu Miaojin waved her hand and suddenly burst into laughter.
Ma Enhui also laughed along with the two of them.
Imperial Academy.
The news of Xu Miaojin’s appointment as the Proctor of Disciplinary office caused a sensation in the Imperial Academy.
In order to establish her own authority and win over the scholars while easing their conflicts, Xu Miaojin publicly announced the appointments of Li Zhigang, Guo Lian, Wang Huai, and seven other scholars made by the Emperor, saying, “Although I, Xu Miao Jin, am a woman, I am wholeheartedly selecting talents for the country. You scholars have studied hard, aren’t you also eager to serve the country? Why do you prioritize my gender over the country’s welfare? It’s like being unable to see Mount Tai while fixating on a falling leaf. Isn’t that what you all are?”
Her words made the scholars of the Imperial Academy blush.
Soon after, one student was publicly caned for failing in his studies.
Xu Miaojin stepped forward and pointed out that caning was not appropriate, as it was a form of insult to the person. She demanded that caning be replaced with the use of a ruler for punishment.
no longer use big sticks on their backsides, but instead use small rulers to hit their palms.
This action won the support of many students in the imperial academy. Xu Miaojin also knew how to leverage the power of the group. They jointly petitioned the Chancellor and eventually succeeded in abolishing the use of corporal punishment in the imperial academy.
With the support of the masses, Xu Miaojin naturally established a firm position in the Imperial Academy and began to explore the educational shortcomings within the academy. At the same time, she managed to find time to reach out to women from other influential families and prepare for the establishment of a women’s academy.
In the afternoon, when Zhu Yunwen returned to Chang’an Palace, holding Zhu Wenkui, he said to Ma Enhui, “During the court session today, it was reported that Li Zengzhi had visited the Department of Music and Entertainment during the period of mourning.”
“Your Majesty, our child is here. Besides, the Department of Music and Entertainment is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Rites. I have no control over it.”
Ma Enhui took the child and cast a reproachful glance at Zhu Yunwen.
The Department of Music and Entertainment was responsible for organizing celebrations, welcoming dignitaries, and overseeing musical performances. It also served as the official brothel, with numerous musicians and female performers, and these female performers were also official courtesans who served the privileged and powerful individuals
Although according to regulations, the female performers in the Department of Music and Entertainment were only meant to entertain and not engage in sexual activities, it was as simple as a flick of the finger for the privileged to obtain a woman devoid of freedom.
For example, by colluding with the officials of the department, they could mention a favored woman and offer a bribe. Then, that woman would mysteriously “die suddenly.”
Once a person died, they would naturally be removed from the department’s roster. As for where the person was taken and whether they were alive or dead, nobody cared.
But Zhu Yunwen cared.

Chapter 28: The Emperor set the Department of Music and Entertainment on fire.
“Your Majesty, the kings are waiting at the Imperial clan court,” Shuangxi interrupted, breaking Zhu Yunwen’s train of thought.
Zhu Yunwen smiled indifferently, looking at the sun outside. It was already afternoon. He couldn’t help but say, “I thought they wouldn’t leave.”
Ma Enhui chuckled and said, “It’s not their fault. The Empress Dowager kept the King of Liao, King of Qin, King of Jin, and King of Min for a chat, and I guess they lost track of time.”
Zhu Yunwen shook his head bitterly. Zhu Di and the others were probably waiting for the King of Qin, Zhu Shangbing, and the King of Jin Zhu Jixi to leave together. But since they didn’t arrive, the delay dragged on until the afternoon.
“Prepare the carriages, I will see them off!”
Zhu Yunwen pinched Zhu Wenkui’s cheek and smiled as he left the palace.
The left gate of Chang’an housed important institutions such as the Imperial Clan Court, Ministry of Personnel, Ministry of Revenue, Ministry of Rites, Ministry of War, Ministry of Works, The court of state ceremonial, and the Imperial Academy of Medicine. The right gate of Chang’an mainly consisted of the Commandery of the Five Armies, Changtai Temple[1]TL’s note: I can’t find any department with this name, the author probably make a mistake, but ill just leave it alone, if you know what this is please comment below., Office of Transmission, Messenger’s office.
The Ministry of Justice, Inspectorate, the Court of Judicial Review, and the Department of Music and Entertainment were located to the west of the Commandery of the Five Armies.
The Imperial Clan Court was the administrative body for the imperial family.
It was actually an invention and creation of Zhu Yuanzhang.
Although Zhu Yuanzhang had vigorous energy, his mind was focused on governing the country. He didn’t have the energy to manage the imperial family. However, Zhu Yuanzhang was a person who valued family bonds, so he couldn’t ignore his relatives from various branches. Therefore, the Imperial Clan court was established.
The main responsibilities of the Imperial clan court were to manage the genealogical records of the emperor’s nine clans, oversee the three ancestral sacrifices, handle the titles and marriages of the imperial family, decide on posthumous names and burial places, and determine punishments for imperial relatives who committed offenses. They also organized gatherings to foster relationships and strengthen kinship.
Zhu Yuanzhang attached great importance to the Imperial Clan court and appointed positions such as director, Left Associate director, Right Associate director, Left Assistant director, and Right Assistant director. Considering that Zhu Biao was the Crown Prince and had a busy schedule, he appointed his second son Zhu Shuang, third son Zhu Gang, fourth son Zhu Di, fifth son Zhu Su, and sixth son Zhu Zhen to these positions.
Unfortunately, Zhu Shuang served for only six years before being poisoned to death.
After Zhu Shuang’s death, the position of Director became vacant, and it was taken over by Zhu Gang, the third son.
However, Zhu Gang also served for only three years before dying of illness.
With the position of Director vacant once again, Zhu Di was expected to succeed, but he didn’t dare to become Director. After witnessing his two older brothers die in that position, he wanted to live longer.
Zhu Yuanzhang probably didn’t want to harm Zhu Di either. As a result, the position of Director remained vacant.
If Zhu Yunwen hadn’t gone to see off the kings, he probably wouldn’t have visited the Imperial Clan Court.
Compared to the mournful scene of a funeral procession, the departure was much grander, with ceremonial attire, music, and escorts. The kings wore no signs of grief on their faces; instead, they seemed cheerful and excited.
Zhu Yunwen understood that these people preferred their fiefdoms. The farther from the capital, the better. They could be kings in their own domains, far away from the emperor.
But it didn’t matter; distance had its advantages.
The number of Kings exceeded nine. Zhu Yuanzhang had twenty-six sons, aside from the Crown Prince and the deceased twenty-sixth son. All the other imperial sons were granted King titles.
In addition, there was another King with different surnames, the King of Jingjiang, Zhu Shouqian, who was the son of Zhu Wenzheng. However, Zhu Shouqian passed away in the twenty-fifth year of Hongwu, and his eldest son Zhu Zanyi became the King of Jingjiang.
They laughed and joked, creating a harmonious atmosphere.
When Zhu Yunwen arrived, Zhu Di led the kings to pay their respects.
Zhu Yunwen looked at everyone and smiled, saying, “Uncles, you are going to your fiefdoms, a long journey awaits. Please take good care of yourselves, especially Uncle Yan and Uncle Ning. The Northern Mongols are still a threat. I ask you two imperial uncles to defend and safeguard our Great Ming.”
Upon hearing this, Zhu Di and Zhu Quan had smiles on their faces, but their hearts were filled with bitterness.
After exchanging pleasantries for a few moments, Zhu Yunwen waved his sleeve and solemnly bowed, saying, “Go now, protect the borders and the people, safeguard our Great Ming! Your names will surely shine in history. Even after five or six hundred, no, a thousand years, people will remember you!”
The eunuchs in the palace knelt down neatly.
The Kings also knelt and bowed, saying in unison, “We will not fail Your Majesty, we will not fail Great Ming! We take our leave.”
Zhu Di stood up, gave a slight smile to Zhu Yunwen, and said, “Your Majesty, take care of your body.”
After saying that, he entered the carriage.
The other kings also bid their farewells and got into their carriages.
The convoy slowly departed.
Zhu Zhi, Zhu Shangbing, Zhu Jixi, and Zhu Geng did not leave but stood beside Zhu Yunwen.
Zhu Yunwen waved his hand and said, “You all go and take a stroll. Enter the palace tomorrow to discuss specific matters.”
The four men nodded quickly, bid their farewells, and left.
Seeing that it was still early, Zhu Yunwen instructed Shuangxi and Liu Changge to change into casual attire. They walked through the right gate of Chang’an and headed towards the Department of Music and Entertainment.
“How many people are currently in the Department of Music and Entertainment?” Zhu Yunwen asked Liu Changge.
Liu Changge replied, “Your Majesty, there are more than 6,800 people listed on the roster of the Department of Music and Entertainment.”
“So many?” Zhu Yunwen frowned.
Liu Changge hesitated for a moment and said, “Your Majesty, in the 26th year of the Hongwu era, General Lan Yu conspired to rebel and was executed by Emperor Taizu. The repercussions were extensive, so…”
Zhu Yunwen glanced at Liu Changge but did not blame him.
It was true that Zhu Yuanzhang had been too ruthless in his executions. In the four major cases during the Hongwu era, the number of people killed in the “Lan Yu case” alone exceeded 15,000. Almost all the brave and valiant generals in the military were wiped out. This was also one of the main reasons why Zhu Yunwen, after ascending the throne, repeatedly failed to defeat Zhu Di.
Most of the people who died were officials or military officers, and some of their families were killed together with them, while others were sent to the Department of Music and Entertainment or the Palace Laundry Service.
Inside the Department of Music and Entertainment, it was bustling with activity.
On the upper floors of the buildings, half-opened windows revealed women standing behind them, some even leaning out to catch a glimpse of the visitors.
A charming woman came forward and, seeing Zhu Yunwen’s extraordinary bearing, deduced his distinguished identity. She smiled and said, “This young sir, is it your first visit? Is it for your beloved in your heart?”
Zhu Yunwen smiled and replied, “Beloved? I wonder who among them is the best here?”
The woman flirtatiously smiled and said, “In this Department of Music and Entertainment, there are thousands of women, each with their own charms. If we consider looks alone, it would be Xiaoyue’er. If we consider talent, Miss Mo Qiusheng must be the leader. And if we consider allure, it would be Murong Jing’er.”
“Oh, how intriguing. Bring these three over,” Zhu Yunwen said softly.
The woman’s face revealed a surprised expression as she looked at Zhu Yunwen and said, “Young master, unfortunately, Xiao Yue’er and Mo Qiusheng are already occupied. How about letting Murong Jing’er accompany you?”
“That’s fine.”
“Young master, hehe, haha…”
The woman laughed naturally.
Zhu Yunwen looked at Shuangxi and said, “Don’t you have any eyes?”
Seeing this, Shuangxi quickly took out some silver and gave it to the woman. Only then did the woman smile with joy and lead Zhu Yunwen up to the Warm Fragrance Pavilion. They stopped in front of a door and she said, “Miss Murong is inside. Please enter, young master.”
After entering the room, a fragrant aroma filled the air, as if they had entered paradise.
“You all wait outside.”
After Zhu Yunwen spoke, Shuangxi nodded repeatedly and closed the door. He muttered to Liu Changge beside him, “This matter must be kept secret. If anyone finds out, it will be a big problem…”
Liu Changge nodded silently.
Why did the Emperor come to the Department of Music and Entertainment when there were so many beautiful women in the palace? This was a taboo, as officials were not supposed to have any involvement with the female musicians of the Department of Music and Entertainment…
Inside the red curtain,
A chill breeze blew, bringing a touch of autumn.
Zhu Yunwen lifted the curtain and looked at the graceful young woman standing quietly by the window. He murmured, “A skyful of autumnal light, Deprives me more and more of my delight. The golden blooms tell me the Double Ninth is nigh. I try my autumn clothes plain And taste new wine with green-ant bubbles old. A gust of wind comes by and by, And then a gust of rain, And then a gust of cold….”
Zhu Yunwen walked over, startling the woman who turned around. He softly said, “The evening courtyard would appear, So sad and drear. The bygones grieve me when I am sobered from wine. How can I bear the endless night. The empty bed and the moon bright! To hear the washerwomen pound the clothes, I pine, And then the crickets sing their song, And then the waterclock drips along..”
Murong Jing’er looked at Zhu Yunwen and bowed respectfully, saying, “Murong Jing’er greets the young master.”
Her black hair danced in the wind, swaying around her slender waist.
Exquisite and ethereal.
Gentle and sorrowful.
Zhu Yunwen looked at Murong Jing’er, nodded slightly, and said, “Please have a seat, Miss.”
Murong Jing’er was somewhat surprised. Seeing that Zhu Yunwen’s gaze held no desire, but rather went straight to the table and started reading the poems she had written, she couldn’t help but feel puzzled.
He was different from other people.
Zhu Yunwen flipped through several pages and accepted the tea that Murong Jing’er handed to him. He thanked her and asked, “How long have you been in the Department of Music and Entertainment, Miss Murong?”
“Replying to the young master, it has been six years.”
Murong Jing’er sat down beside him and replied softly.
Zhu Yunwen frowned. This time coincided with the Lan Yu Case, which made him ask, “Is your family a military officer?”
Murong Jing’er shook her head and said with a touch of sadness, “My father is just a clerk in the military.”
A clerk!
An inconspicuous low-ranking official.
But these people also died because of the Lan Yu Case.
Zhu Yunwen felt guilty.
One of the biggest reasons Zhu Yuanzhang, had massacred the meritorious official was to secure his own position.
“Is the Department of Music and Entertainment a paradise or a hell?”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Murong Jing’er and asked in a deep voice.
Murong Jing’er was somewhat surprised, looking at Zhu Yunwen with a hint of confusion. The young master before her was not seeking intimate pleasures, nor did he appear to be a libertine or a reckless person.
Paradise?
Hell?
Murong Jing’er had never heard anyone ask such a question. Seeing that Zhu Yunwen was serious, she forced a bitter smile and replied, “For the young master, this place is paradise.”
Zhu Yunwen shook his head slightly and said, “It seems that hiding is the most important thing. Never mind, would you like to leave this place and start a new life?”
Murong Jing’er stared at Zhu Yunwen, astonished and unable to speak.
Zhu Yunwen stood up, walked in front of Murong Jing’er, and said slowly, “You haven’t answered my question yet.”
Murong Jing’er took a step forward, almost pressing herself against Zhu Yunwen’s body. She raised her head slightly and pleaded, “If the young master can let Jing’er leave this place, Jing’er is willing to be a cow or a horse, serving the young master.”
The women of the Department of Music and Entertainment were not treated as human beings, but as objects.
To be precise, playthings.
No one truly saw them as human beings.
Zhu Yunwen placed his hand on Murong Jing’er’s fragrant shoulder and gently pushed her back a step, saying, “For you, the Department of Music and Entertainment is hell. For me, it is the same. But the Department of Music and Entertainment is built on the earth, not in the underworld! So, wouldn’t it be better to burn it down?”
“Burn it down?!”
Murong Jing’er looked at Zhu Yunwen in astonishment, and in a daze, she asked, “How? How do we burn it down?”
Zhu Yunwen smiled and said, “Miss, may I borrow your matchstick?”
Perplexed, Murong Jing’er fetched a matchstick from the side and handed it to Zhu Yunwen. Zhu Yunwen opened it, blew out a flame, and then, in front of Murong Jing’er’s widened eyes, he threw the match onto the bed.
Zhu Yunwen watched as the fire ignited the sheets and calmly said to Murong Jing’er, “See, isn’t it burning now?”

Chapter 29: Abolishing the Department of Music and Entertainment, and Establishing the Bureau of Artistry
The fire ignites the crimson brocade, its feeble light flickering gently.
“You…”
Murong Jing’er’s face turns pale, shocked by the audacity of the young master before her. He openly starts a fire, and when she tries to put it out, Zhu Yunwen stops her.
“Are there any valuable things in the room? Take them with you.”
“You’re going to bring disaster upon yourself!”
Murong Jing’er says anxiously.
Zhu Yunwen shakes his head and says, “Take your belongings and come with me.”
Murong Jing’er looks at the burning blanket. It won’t be long before the bed catches fire, and the whole room will be engulfed. Looking at the confident and composed young master before her, Murong Jing’er sighs and walks to the side, taking out a redwood box from under a chest.
Zhu Yunwen opens the door and says to Shuangxi, “You have fifteen minutes to evacuate everyone here. Remember, not a single person should be left behind! If someone is missing, you’ll stay in the burning room.”
Shuangxi glances at the fire in the room and shivers, shouting in a high-pitched voice, “Fire! Run!”
Chaos ensues.
Some people try to extinguish the fire but are kicked out by Liu Changge.
This fire was set by the emperor. Without his permission, no one can put it out.
Zhu Yunwen stands by the railing, calmly watching people panic and flee. Many men and women are barely dressed, revealing their intimate parts. Some young masters remain composed, nodding as they look towards the direction of the fire, likely contemplating suitable poetry.
There are even elderly men in their sixties or seventies. Damn it, you’re already in such a state, why do you still come out to enjoy yourself? Aren’t you afraid of coming in standing and going out lying down?
In the room behind them, the bed catches fire.
Murong Jing’er holds the wooden box and stands next to Zhu Yunwen. From her initial shock and astonishment to her current calmness, she has nothing more to worry about.
Let it burn, and so be it.
All this place has given her is a shame, nothing good.
“You should leave. This is the Department of Music and Entertainment. If someone investigates, you’ll be at a disadvantage.”
Murong Jing’er says with concern.
Zhu Yunwen looks at Murong Jing’er and calmly says, “Let them come.”
Murong Jing’er is unsure of Zhu Yunwen’s identity, but seeing his confidence, she no longer says anything. When she lowers her head, she sees a plump middle-aged man running towards them with a group of people. He looks at the burning room and kicks a woman who is trying to escape, shouting, “Who dares to run? Get water and put out the fire!”
“It’s bad, Director Cheng is here. Run!” Murong Jing’er exclaims in surprise, urging Zhu Yunwen.
Zhu Yunwen turns around and looks at the fire, estimating that it will take a while to spread to the neighboring room. The surrounding people have scattered, so it won’t harm anyone. He feels relieved.
Fengluan(Director of the Department of Musi), a ninth-ranked official, is the seal-holding official of the Department of Music and Entertainment.
Director Cheng angrily rushes up the stairs with his men. A servant points at Liu Changge and says, “He won’t let us extinguish the fire.”
“How dare you! This is the Department of Music and Entertainment, the emperor’s domain. How dare you act so insolently! Tie him up for me!” Director Cheng shouts sternly.
Zhu Yunwen pulls Murong Jing’er back two steps and says to Liu Changge, “I’ve heard that you are skilled. Show us today?”
Liu Changge’s mouth twitches, thinking, My emperor, I’m a military man. Are you belittling me by having me deal with these hooligans? But there’s no choice. The emperor has given an order, what else can I do?
As it turns out, part-time brawlers are no match for professional fighters.
Liu Changge delivers a heavy beating, and more than ten people are already lying on the ground, wailing.
Director Cheng’s forehead breaks out in a sweat. He grits his teeth and shouts, “Even if you have some skills, you won’t escape the punishment of the law! I will report to the emperor and have you brought to justice!”
“Let’s talk about it when your report reaches the emperor.”
Liu Changge rubs his fist, not satisfied.
“Alright, the fire has started. Stop playing with him, Director Cheng, right? How many people are in the Department of Music and Entertainment? You will take that many people to the Ministry of Rites. If one is missing, your skin will hang outside the South Gate!”
Zhu Yunwen walks towards the staircase, then turns around and shouts to Murong Jing’er, who is still standing in place, “Let’s go, what are you waiting for?”
Murong Jing’er quickly follows.
Director Cheng looked at the Great Ming Security Bureau token in Liu Changge’s hand, feeling a chill run through his body. Especially when he heard Liu Changge identify himself, If Cheng Fengluan could not figure out the person before was the Emperor, he would have wasted his efforts
“Get to work.” After Liu Changge finished speaking, he followed closely behind.
Shuangxi also runs over. Zhu Yunwen gives a couple of instructions, and Shuangxi returns to Director Cheng’s side, saying, “The fire can be put out now.”
Director Cheng kicked the servant beside him a few times, shouting, “What are you standing there for? Put out the fire and evacuate the people!”
After three rooms had burned down, the fire was finally extinguished.
Director Cheng didn’t care about the damage caused by the fire, but he was anxious about the tasks that lay ahead. He organized a group of people and called out all people, young and old, from the Department of Music and Entertainment. They lined up in formation and headed toward the Ministry of Rites.
With nearly 7,000 people in the procession, it created a stir on West Chang’an Street. The garrisons of Nanjing and the Five Army Commandery also heard the commotion and immediately imposed martial law.
Xu Huizu hurriedly entered the palace, but before he reached the Chengtian Gate, he saw four people leisurely walking towards him on the street. Upon closer inspection, wasn’t that His Majesty?
“Your Majesty? What… what’s going on?”
Xu Huizu quickly stepped forward to greet them and arranged for soldiers to protect the Emperor.
Zhu Yunwen waved his hand and said, “Don’t be so nervous. No one will harm me. Let me introduce you. This is Murong Jing’er. Shuangxi, gather all the people from the Ministry of Rites. We have urgent matters to attend to tonight, and if they’re not finished, no one should expect to go home and sleep!”
Xu Huizu’s eyes widened, and he nodded respectfully to Murong Jing’er.
Murong Jing’er, feeling somewhat numb, looked at smiling Zhu Yunwen and swallowed her saliva. She quickly knelt down and exclaimed, “Murong Jing’er pays respects to Your Majesty.”
Zhu Yunwen helped Murong Jing’er up and glanced in the direction of the procession. The people from the Department of Music and Entertainment were coming in a mass, but judging from the tense atmosphere, they were probably worried about an uncertain future.
“I don’t like a hell on earth.”
Zhu Yunwen smiled and released Murong Jing’er, then said to Xu Huizu, “Arrange for maintaining order and have everyone stand in formation. Divide them into ten columns, with the front of the line reaching outside the gate of the Ministry of Rites.”
Xu Huizu agreed and organized the personnel to maintain order.
The women from the Department of Music and Entertainment didn’t know what was happening. When they saw the soldiers, some of the timid ones started crying. But after a while, they realized that the soldiers weren’t causing any trouble. They were just standing there, maintaining order, so they calmed down.
Chen Di, the Minister of Rites, Left Vice Minister Chen Xingshan, Assistant Minister Huang Guan, and other officials had already received the imperial edict and hurriedly went out to greet them. Other departments also heard the commotion and came out to investigate. When they saw the Emperor, they all kneeled and paid their respects.
Zhu Yunwen pointed to the entrance of the Ministry of Rites and said, “Set up ten tables there and prepare to register the Department of Music and Entertainment personnel under different households. Also, have the Ministry of Revenue officials come over. We’ll settle all the matters together.”
“Register under different households? Oh, Your Majesty, if it’s just one woman, we don’t need ten tables, right?”
Chen Di glanced at Murong Jing’er, who was standing next to Zhu Yunwen and smiled.
Xu Huizu’s mouth twitched. Just wait and see, you’ll be crying later.
Zhu Yunwen turned around, and the others also turned to the side. Chen Di and the officials of the Ministry of Rites looked up and saw rows of women slowly approaching. There seemed to be no less than a few hundred of them.
The procession entered the Thousand-step Corridor and gradually approached. The people in front had already reached the Ministry of Rites, but the end of the line was still not in sight.
Chen Di shivered and smiled bitterly at Zhu Yunwen.
Zhu Yunwen smiled calmly and said, “Everyone prepares yourselves. Liu Changge, send the order. Any women from the Department of Music and Entertainment who have nowhere to go or no family to rely on and are willing to enter the palace, register under the palace’s women’s households. If they want to return home, register them under farming households. If they have skills to make a living, register them under artisan households… Let them decide their own household registration.”
The officials of the Ministry of Rites were a bit dumbfounded. With so many people, how many household registrations would they have to write?
Wouldn’t that exhaust them to death?
Shuangxi brought a chair, and Zhu Yunwen sat down beside it, saying, “Murong Jing’er, you go first.”
Murong Jing’er looked deeply at him, Under Zhu Yunwen’s encouragement, then approached the table where Chen Di was sitting. She glanced back at Zhu Yunwen before saying, “Murong Jing’er, eighteen years old, from Suzhou Prefecture… Register under the palace’s women households.”
Chen Di had no choice but to carry out the registration.
Murong Jing’er looked at her new household registration and walked back to Zhu Yunwen. She knelt down and said, “Thank you for the grace of Your Majesty!”
“Thank you for the grace of Your Majesty!”
The women from the Department of Music and Entertainment all knelt and paid their respects.
The sound of their voices piled up, starting from the front of the procession and spreading to the unseen rear. Countless people watched this scene, feeling somewhat moved.
After hearing the commotion outside the palace, Ma Enhui remained silent for a while. Then she led a group of maids out of the palace and ordered eunuchs and palace maids to set up boilers outside the palace gate and prepare hot tea. She also ordered the Needlework Bureau and the Bureau of Headwear and Accessories to send a batch of warm clothing to the outside of the palace.
Although it wasn’t very cold on this autumn night, there was a slight chill in the air.
For some of the adults, it was bearable, but for the elderly and the young, it was uncomfortable.
As the Emperor, Zhu Yunwen had not considered this, but as his wife, how could Ma Enhui not be more considerate?
Ma Enhui had the Inner Palace supervisors vacate more than 300 rooms and temporarily accommodate the women registered under the palace’s women’s households. As for those registered under other households, they were temporarily arranged in the Department of Music and Entertainment. Tomorrow morning, they would be given a resettlement allowance, and they could leave on their own.
In an instant, the people of Nanjing City were moved. The names “Holy Emperor” and “Holy Empress” entered the hearts of the people as they cheered.
On the 17th day of the eighth month in the 31st year of the Hongwu reign, Zhu Yunwen abolished the Department of Music and Entertainment, and established the Bureau of Artistry, with Murong Jing’er as the chief supervisor.
That day, a total of 4,216 courtesans were disbanded, leaving 2,600 behind. They were incorporated into the Bureau of Artistry and responsible for various performances such as dance, music, and acrobatics, under the jurisdiction of the Inner Palace.
Chang’an Palace.
Ma Enhui sat at the desk, constantly rolling her eyes at Zhu Yunwen. When the maids asked what she wanted to eat for lunch, Ma Enhui’s face turned bitter as she said, “What else can we eat? Just make some Wotou[1]Wotou or wowotou, also called Chinese cornbread, is a type of steamed bread made from cornmeal in Northern China. and barely make do for the two of us.”
Zhu Yunwen felt helpless and instructed the maids to proceed as usual. He said to Ma Enhui, “Is it really necessary?”
Ma Enhui snorted and said, “You really don’t understand anything as the head of the household. You don’t know how expensive firewood and rice are. The Bureau of Artistry alone has 2,600 people, which means 2,600 mouths to feed. In previous years, there were only little over 8,000 palace maids, and it cost nearly 300,000 taels of silver a year. Now with so many more people, how are we going to handle this expense?”
“That is a problem,” Zhu Yunwen frowned, looking at Ma Enhui seriously. “How about we have Wotou for lunch?”
“…” Ma Enhui was speechless.

Chapter 30: Single Whip Method, the Starting Point of Agricultural Tax Reform.
Money is a huge problem.
The current Ministry of Revenue is not too difficult. Huang Zicheng, the Minister of Revenue, and Zhuo Jing, the Right Vice Minister, find their positions relatively easy. It’s because the foundation laid by Zhu Yuanzhang is still commendable. At least the court is not lacking in funds and provisions at the moment.
It makes sense if you think about it. Emperor Jianwen and Zhu Di fought for four years, and the finances were able to keep up. There’s no reason why implementing some reforms would suddenly deplete the funds.
However, relying solely on the existing system established by Zhu Yuanzhang is not a viable solution. The fate of the Ming Dynasty cannot be changed merely by the operation of his system. The suffering imposed on the people of Ming will still persist.
This is not the outcome that Zhu Yunwen wants to see. Therefore, establishing the status of merchants, changing Zhu Yuanzhang’s policy of favoring agriculture over commerce, and vigorously developing industry and commerce will be Zhu Yunwen’s inevitable choice.
However, the development of industry and commerce requires abundant resources and the free movement of people.
According to the military, agricultural, and artisan registers established by Zhu Yuanzhang, every generation must engage in their designated occupation.
If you’re a farmer, you’ll be a farmer for ten thousand years. If you’re a soldier, even if your family dies out, you still have to find someone to serve as a soldier on your behalf, whether it’s your nephew or cousin—it doesn’t matter.
Without reforming the household registration system, it is impossible to promote commercial reform.
And the reform of the household registration system also involves land reform and a land tax system.
There are layers of problems. It’s not enough to simply loosen the restrictions on merchants and expect the economy to develop, the market to prosper and enjoy the tax revenue.
“In the end, it is necessary to first liberate the labor force.”
Without liberating the farmers, problems at the lower level will continue to arise.
Without liberating the farmers, there will be no surplus labor in the cities.
Without liberating the farmers, commerce will not be able to develop…
Behind each interlocking issue lies the problem of land.
Zhu Yunwen turned his attention to the issue of land taxation.
During the Ming Dynasty, the main agricultural tax was the land tax.
The land tax followed a dual taxation system, with the summer tax collected in the eighth lunar month and the autumn grain tax collected in the second month after the autumn harvest.
The tax rate was roughly 5% to 10% of the total harvest.
In the early Ming dynasty, both the summer tax and the autumn grain tax were paid in the form of grain, using the method of physical taxation. During the tax collection, people would carry grain with carts, pushcarts, or on their shoulders and bring it to the government offices to pay their taxes. The government would then transport the received grain to Nanjing using various methods.
The court will use this grain to pay the salaries of the imperial relatives, officials, and soldiers.
When it was time to distribute salaries, high-ranking officials would receive several bags of rice, and ninth-rank officials would receive a certain amount of rice. It was all predetermined, and everyone would come to collect their share with their sacks.
In the early Ming Dynasty, the salaries of officials were often given in units of grain called “stone” rather than in the currency unit of “tael”. This method of paying salaries with grain was not because the emperor was stingy but because, at the time, grain was a valuable currency.
In other words, if you carried grain and went to buy vegetables or tofu, people would accept it as payment.
In the middle and late Ming Dynasty, silver gradually became the common currency, and some people no longer had to pay in grain but could convert it into silver.
Of course, this did not result in a unified system and implementation was quite chaotic.
In addition to the land tax, there were also poll taxes and corvée labor.
To change all of this, Zhu Yunwen must address the issue of agricultural taxation.
In the early Ming Dynasty, agricultural taxes accounted for the majority of central finances, while commercial taxes were relatively insignificant the kind that was easily ignored.
Changing the agricultural tax system is not something that can be accomplished with just a few words.
How to change it?
In the future, the government has been collecting grain taxes for several decades, supporting the development of urban industry and commerce. When the time was ripe, they abolished agricultural taxes. This tax category no longer exists.
Can Zhu Yunwen cancel agricultural taxes?
Is he brave enough to do so?
If they are abolished, the entire foundation of Ming’s rule will be lost. It would be strange if the dynasty didn’t collapse.
But what method can be used to loosen the restrictions on farmers?
Zhu Yunwen thought of the greatest politician and reformist of the Ming Dynasty, Zhang Juzheng. This prominent Grand Secretary, who implemented the “Single Whip Method” during the reforms, received high praise in later historical books.
And this evaluation carries a distinct phrase:
Epoch-making!
After the Ming Dynasty, the Qing Dynasty continued with the Single Whip Method, which later developed into the “Assessment according to Farmland” system.
“Summon the Grand Secretariat secretaries, the Minister of Revenue, and the Vice Minister.”
Zhu Yunwen made up his mind and brought the “Single Whip Method” onto the historical stage 183 years earlier.
The core of the Single Whip Method is to combine the various taxes, corvee, and miscellaneous charges in each state and county into a single unified tax collected in silver, calculated per acre.
When a single whip method was placed in front of Grand Secretariat Secretaries, Minister of Revenue Huang Zicheng, and the Right vice minister, Zhuo Jing, no one spoke for a long time.
“Your Majesty, this system seems mysterious and profound, quite ingenious. However, I do not recommend its implementation,” Huang Zicheng cautiously said after contemplating for a long time.
Emperor Zhu Yunwen didn’t expect these people to accept it all at once, so he asked, “Tell me your thoughts.”
Huang Zicheng spoke frankly, “Firstly, adopting a “single whip method” may not be applicable nationwide. The land in the Jiangnan region is fertile and abundant in resources, so it would be easy to convert. But in the northern regions, where the land is barren and yields are low, would the conversion be fair? Secondly, once the single whip method is implemented and unable to sustain the finances, additional corvee labor and taxes will be imposed. Would it be detrimental to the people?”
“Thirdly, although converting grain into silver can save a lot of trouble, the farmers do not have silver. They can only exchange it with merchants before paying taxes. If the price of silver is deliberately raised, with silver being valuable and grain being cheap, how can the people live peacefully?”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Huang Zicheng and realized that this guy had some insight into economic matters.
Xie Jin shook his head and stood up, saying, “Your Majesty, Minister Huang’s words are reasonable. However, in my opinion, the advantages of implementing the single whip method outweigh the disadvantages.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Xie Jin and nodded, saying, “Please elaborate.”
Xie Jin spoke frankly, “The single whip method integrates land taxes, corvee labor, and miscellaneous tax into one. It can prevent repetitive tax and frequent reduction by lower-level officials, which is beneficial in reducing the burden on common households. The assessment of taxes and labor duties was primarily based on the “li-jia” system, The problem of uneven burden among households is particularly prominent, with some shouldering lighter burdens while others bear heavier ones, by adopting this method, the problem can be alleviated, which is beneficial for agricultural activities. This is one of the advantages…”
“Secondly, replacing physical goods with silver coins can avoid the loss of money and grain during the annual transportation from various regions to the capital. If the court requires grain, it can simply reward and mobilize the people and the local authorities can handle the transportation, eliminating the need to burden the farmers unnecessarily.
” The third aspect is the implementation of the whip method can reduce the expenditure on tax levies. Under this law, the government presents a list of tax obligations, and each household completes the list. This eliminates the need for village leaders to intervene, prevents embezzlement by granary officials, and minimizes losses in public grain storage. Therefore, I believe this method is feasible.”
Zhu Yunwen, with admiration in his eyes, looked at Jie Jin and then turned his gaze towards the grand secretary of the Grand Secretariat, Yu Xin. He asked, “Secretary Yu, as the former Minister of Revenue, do you have any insights or opinions to share?”
Yu Xin smiled indifferently and greatly appreciated the humble and open-minded attitude of the new emperor. He said, “I concur with Minister Xie. This method is indeed feasible. I must admit that our intellectual capacities are mediocre, and we had not thought of such a brilliant solution. Upon careful consideration, Minister Huang’s words are also pertinent. Indeed, there are certain issues that need to be addressed.”
“In my view, although this method is new, it appears to be substantial and reliable. If there is unity between the higher and lower ranks, it can certainly be implemented. However, I am concerned that once this approach extends to the provincial and county levels, lower-level officials may find their opportunities for embezzlement diminished. They might maliciously resist and disrupt the implementation of this method, causing harm to the people in the name of the emperor.”
Zhu Yunwen’s pupils slightly constricted. Indeed, Yuxin was experienced and knowledgeable. He understood both the effectiveness and limitations of the “one whip method.” What mattered most was not its implementation at the central level, but rather the cooperation of local authorities.
If local officials, powerful elites, and oppressive gentry take the lead in opposing it, even the best system will not be effectively implemented at the grassroots level. In fact, it may be detrimental to the people!
Zhu Yunwen nodded solemnly, saying, “Each of you only sees the present but not the future. Every day, every year, Kings, ministers, landlords, and wealthy merchants are constantly annexing land, finding ways to take away the farmers’ land. Once the farmers encounter disasters or floods, they can only sell their land and become tenant farmers without any freedom.”
“It’s ridiculous that tenant farmers work hard but end up impoverished. And the grain they produce ultimately falls into the hands of the kings, ministers, landlords, and wealthy merchants, some of whom avoid taxes or evade tax. By that time, most of the land will be controlled by those people, and how much tax can the country collect?”
“Furthermore, in the north, the Mongol forces are still a threat. They will repeatedly invade our borders. Along the coast, pirates and Japanese pirates will also emerge. Officials need salaries, the military needs funds and provisions, and to cope with significant expenses using limited financial resources. how can we maintain the prosperity of the Ming Empire?”
“We can’t! that’s why, we not only need to reform the agricultural tax system but also the land system and commercial systems! Let me tell you, to build a strong and prosperous Ming Empire, we need the courage to open up a prosperous era! We must dare to take an unprecedented path!”
Looking at the ambitious and determined Zhu Yunwen, Yu Xin, Zhang Shan, Xie Jin, Huang Zicheng, and Zhuo Jing felt a surge of enthusiasm ignite within their hearts as well.
From Zhu Yunwen’s words, it could be seen that he was not just concerned about the agricultural tax system but the entire empire’s issues. His vision was not limited to the present but extended to the future.
To serve such an emperor was the fortune of his subjects!
“I give you one month to come up with a feasible plan, identify the problems, and propose solutions. If the Grand Secretariat and the Ministry of Revenue are unable to solve them, you can collectively brainstorm with scholars from the Imperial Academy to participate.”
Zhu Yunwen issued the command.
Although Emperor Zhu Yunwen was determined to carry out reforms, he was not in a hurry to take the first step.
What still restrained Emperor Zhu Yunwen was the issue of the vassal kings, specifically, the King of Yan, Zhu Di!
On August 16th, the King of Yan Zhu Di left the capital. After crossing the Yangtze River, he traveled day and night and headed straight to Beiping Prefecture. When Zhu Di arrived in Xuzhou, Ping An, and Sheng Yong began their actions in Beiping Prefecture.
On September 5th, Sheng Yong dismissed and transferred thirty-two military commanders, selecting talents from the military and giving them important responsibilities.
On September 6th, Ping An mobilized a large army to change the defense of Beiping, while the troops originally responsible for defense were sent to areas like Linqing for training.
On September 7th, Qu Neng conducted large-scale military training at Shanhai Pass.
…
On September 9th, Ping An received the implementation order for the new military policy and began implementing the policy around Beiping Prefecture.
PS:
In the text, it mentions the implementation of the “single whip method” 183 years in advance. Here, the time is based on the promotion of the “single whip method” by Zhang Juzheng. The initiator was Gui’e of the Ming Dynasty, who proposed it in the 10th year of Jiajing, around 1530. Zhang Juzheng implemented it nationwide in the 9th year of Wanli, around 1581, so the latter date is used as the reference.

Chapter 31: New Military Policy Implemented in Beiping
Zhu Yunwen knew very well that Zhu Di had been managing Beiping for many years, establishing strong popular support and great respect in the military. Therefore, the sharp blade of the New Military policy was thrust into Beiping Prefecture.
You, Zhu Di, think you have the support of the military?
Well, let’s put it to the test. Let’s see whose side the military is on, yours or mine.
Beiping, the training ground.
Flags fluttered, and horns sounded loudly.
Fifty thousand elite soldiers stood in formation, their mighty presence sweeping across the heavens and earth, their intimidating aura shaking the hearts of people.
Several commanders stood at the forefront of the formation, with burning eyes as they looked at Ping An and Sheng Yong on the high platform.
Ping An raised his head and took a step forward, shouting with a deep and resonant voice, “These past few days, people have been asking me what the New Military Policy is all about. Let me tell you, the New Military Policy is a major national policy born from the Emperor’s heartfelt concern and care for the soldiers! It’s the benefit given to us, soldiers, by the Emperor’s frugal savings!”
“The New Military Policy, how good is it? Haha, this is the treatment that moves the four hundred thousand troops of the capital’s garrison to tears! I heard that a few of them, being too happy, even fainted on the spot! If they were soldiers under my command, I would have to kick them out, because they are too ignorant!”
“But, my brothers, when I, Ping An, learned about the content of the New Military Policy, I also felt like fainting. Such good treatment, it makes me willing to go all out, kill the Tatars and Oirats, even if it means dying outside!”
“But this is the policy of the capital garrison, not ours! I, Ping An, am a rough man with a violent temper, I am not willing to accept it. Why is it that all of us, who is also a soldier, born of our parents, why we soldiers from the north, are treated worse than the young masters soldiers of the capital’s garrison?!”
“This is unfair! Brothers, what do you think? The capital garrison eats meat every day, while we chew on dirt. The capital garrison receives special training every day, while we run every day. The capital garrison has family visitation leave every month, while we haven’t been home for years. When the parents of the capital garrison soldiers are sick, they can use the Emperor’s money for medical treatment, but when our parents are sick, we can only wait for death. Is this fair? Do you think it’s fair?!”
“Unfair!”
Over fifty thousand people shouted with raised voices!
Ping An shouted loudly, “I also think it’s unfair! So, I took the backdoor and went to see Xu Huizu, of the Five Army Commandery, and asked him to deliver a message to the Emperor, Let me, Ping An, come to Beiping and manage the army, but my soldiers must receive the same treatment as the capital garrison. They should have meat to eat, be granted leave to visit their families, and if their parents are sick, they should receive funds for medical treatment! And even after death, the court should help send our parents off and assist our children in starting families! Do you think my demands are right?”
“Right!”
They shouted in unison!
Ping An smiled brightly and shouted, “Listen up, all of you! I misunderstood the Emperor. The Emperor said that the New Military Policy would be tested in the capital garrison first, and after gaining experience, it would be extended to the entire army. The Emperor is concerned about us, he hasn’t forgotten us! The Emperor’s grace!”
“The Emperor’s grace!”
“The Emperor’s grace!”
“The Emperor’s grace!”
The soldiers’ blood boiled, and they shouted.
Ping An took out a document from his pocket and raised it high, shouting with all his might, “I, Ping An, don’t like waiting. Since the Emperor has already implemented the New Military Policy in the garrison, let’s also implement it in all the Guards of our Beiping! The Emperor has already approved it, outside the capital garrison, implementing the New Military Policy at Beiping, Sheng Yong!”
“Here!”
Sheng Yong stepped forward loudly.
Ping An took out a booklet and shouted sternly, “Announcing the New Military Policy to all soldiers!”
Sheng Yong stepped forward and received the booklet, shouting loudly, “All soldiers of our Great Ming, loyal to the court, loyal to the Great Ming, are the guardians of our Great Ming. They shall be treated equally, implementing the New Military Policy and spreading them throughout the entire army.”
“The First New Military Policy:
Soldiers fight a hundred battles, and their physical well-being is fundamental. We shall improve their food, strengthening their bodies and spirits. They shall not have fewer than three meals a day, and they shall not be without meat. Each meal should consist of no less than two dishes, ensuring they are well-fed.”
“The second New Military Policy: Soldiers fight for the nation, for the people, for their families, it’s the common nature of human beings, Arrange for a family visit and ensure the safety of family members. They shall be granted a two-day leave each month to visit their families. If they do not take leave in a given month, it can be accumulated to the following month. During festivals such as Mid-Autumn, Spring Festival, and Qingming, they shall be granted a three-day leave, with reasonable rotation schedules.”
“The third New Military Policy: The parents of soldiers, being equal to the common people of the court, shall be cared for by the court. If their family members fall ill, His Majesty will provide fifty percent of the medical expenses from the imperial treasury. A Family Affairs Department will be established to address any difficulties faced by their families, and all problems can be reported to the department.”
“…”
“The twentieth New Military Policy: Those who serve in the military for more than twenty years may apply to leave the military camp. Their families shall be exempt from conscription for three years, and they shall enjoy the salary of an eighth-grade official. Their children shall enjoy the salary of a deputy eighth-grade official, and subsequent generations shall receive decreasing benefits until the fourth generation when they shall be exempted…”
Behind Sheng Yong stood dozens of strong men, loudly announcing the New Military Policy to the entire army.
Each new policy brought extreme joy to the soldiers present!
Their own treatment, the treatment of their families, posthumous treatment, and retirement benefits were all clearly outlined. Their eyes widened, and their breath quickened.
In the past, when they were soldiers, they only received their military pay, unsure when they would be able to return home. If they died on the battlefield, how much money would reach their families? No one knew!
But now, they knew!
In the past, when we were in the army, our parents became old and ill, and couldn’t find a good doctor or afford medication. But now, things have changed. The Emperor himself provides us with money. We are using the Emperor’s funds, so who would dare refuse to provide us with medicine and medical treatment?
The Emperor cares for our parents as if they were his own!
Some people retired, left with illnesses and pains that no one cared about. But now, they are not afraid anymore. If they serve for a full twenty years, they can go home, and they can enjoy the benefits of an official. Although the benefits decrease with each generation, they are still receiving food from the Emperor!
They have worked hard their whole lives, and their future generations will enjoy blessings!
How can soldiers like this not fight with all their might?
What? They give so much money when I die? And a subsidy for up to ten years!
Is this life of mine so valuable?
The Emperor has been too good to us!
“We thank His Majesty for his heavenly grace! We will not disappoint His Majesty, the court, or the Great Ming!”
“We thank His Majesty for his heavenly grace! We will not disappoint His Majesty, the court, or the Great Ming!”
All the soldiers shouted with all their might as if trying to let out all the passion in their hearts.
The entire army thundered!
The sound reached the heavens!
Their momentum soared!
Under the leadership of Ping’an and Shengyong, the New Military Policy is expressed through oaths, demonstrating the unwavering loyalty of the entire army to the imperial court and the will of Emperor Jianwen.
After returning to the military office, Peace and Sheng Yong ordered their subordinates to post the New Military Policy on the streets and alleys of Beiping Prefecture and assigned dedicated individuals to explain them.
There were not many literate people in this era. Without anyone to explain, who knows what is written on those papers?
Within a very short time, the New Military Policy spread throughout Beiping Prefecture, including the surrounding garrison. Ping An and Sheng Yong made several attacks, using the New Military Policy to win over these veteran soldiers of the King of Yan.
King of Yan mansion.
Zhang Yu, a 56-year-old general, had a sorrowful expression on his face. As the Assistant commander of King of Yan’s left guard, he had not had a peaceful sleep for over a month.
When the King of Yan Zhu Di went to the capital, Zhang Yu felt at ease.
But within two months, the situation in Beiping Prefecture took a drastic turn.
Zhang Bing, Ping An, Sheng Yong, Qu Neng, and others took control of Beiping, Shanhai Pass, and other regions, putting immense pressure on the situation.
Zhang Yu hurriedly sought a discussion with the people of the King of Yan Mansion on how to respond. However, the mansion was currently empty. Zhu Di was not there, and his three sons were absent as well. When Zhang Yu asked the King Consort, Xu Yihua, even she couldn’t make a decisive suggestion.
As for Zhu Di’s two sons-in-law, Yuan Rong and Li Rang, they didn’t have much capability.
In desperation, Zhang Yu discussed with Zhu Neng, the commanding officer of the Right Guard, and decided to go to Qingshou Temple to listen to the opinions of Dao Yan.
After a careful analysis of the situation, Dao Yan concluded that although Ping An, Sheng Yong, and others were aggressive, they did not affect the overall situation. After all, the soldiers in Beiping Prefecture and the surrounding garrisons were primarily loyal to the King of Yan. Some of the officers were even personally promoted by the King of Yan himself.
Although Ping An, and Sheng Yong, had control over the military, it did not mean they could command these people. As long as Zhu Di returned, there would be no major issue.
To remain still and use stillness to control movement.
This was Dao Yan’s wisdom.
Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng, know Dao Yan’s abilities and how Zhu Di trusted him and followed Dao Yan’s arrangements. They dispatched people to gather information about the situation in the capital and secretly contacted King of Yan’s former subordinates, taking cautious measures.
However, before Zhang Yu could settle down, news arrived that Dao Yan had been summoned and was on his way to the capital. Startled, Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng hurried to Qingshou Temple, only to be informed that Dao Yan had been taken away by envoys from the capital and the Central Buddhist Registry.
In a state of helplessness, Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng, along with their men, frantically pursued and caught up to Dao Yan twenty miles away from the city.
They offered a hefty sum of money, hoping that the Central Buddhist Registry and the envoys from the capital would release Dao Yan. However, they were well aware of the severity of Zhu Yunwen’s orders. If they failed to bring Dao Yan to the capital, their heads were likely at stake.
When it came to matters of money and life, the majority leaned toward life.
Since they couldn’t take Dao Yan away, Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng had to pave the way with money, buying some time for Dao Yan to stay temporarily.
Although the command “not to delay” from Zhu Yunwen is non-negotiable, the individuals responsible for carrying out the command can be negotiated.
It doesn’t make sense to have money and not earn it.
When it comes to this kind of job, if you don’t accept some bribes or seek some benefits, how can you return to the capital and make your way to the Qinhuai River?
Dao Yan doesn’t know what changes have occurred in the capital, nor does he understand why Zhu Yunwen specifically summoned him to the palace. However, Dao Yan is well aware that his dream is likely to be shattered.
Standing on the roadside, Dao Yan wears a desolate expression, gazing at the uncertain path ahead, feeling a profound sense of desolation within. With all his knowledge and skills, he finds himself devoid of purpose.
Under the clear sky and bright sun, a lifetime wasted in vain!
How sorrowful it is!
How lamentable it is!
In the realm of Buddhism, unable to achieve enlightenment.
In the realm of Taoism, unable to reach sagehood.
Even the formidable Dragon Gate collapses with a resounding crash.
The myriad things in this world ultimately turn into illusory emptiness.
With a dejected spirit, Dao Yan arranged some matters for Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng, and wrote a letter, entrusting them to deliver it to the King of Yan, Zhu Di. Afterward, he joined the entourage of the Central Buddhist Registry and the envoys heading to the capital city.
Zhang Yu, Zhu Neng, and everyone in the King of Yan Mansion felt immense pressure.
If Dao Yan’s departure was a thorn in Zhang Yu’s side, then the New Military Policy implemented by Ping An and Sheng Yong on the ninth day of the ninth month was a razor-sharp sword that pierced Zhang Yu’s heart!
A fatal blow!
The specific details of the New Military Policy quickly spread throughout the King of Yan Mansion and the Three Guards of the King of Yan.
The three guards of the King of Yan cheered in unison, filled with joy and exuberance. Each of them regarded the new emperor, Zhu Yunwen, as their benevolent benefactor and pledged their allegiance to him along with the others.
However, when it was noon, they realized that there was no meat in their meals. The Three Guards of the King of Yan were unhappy. They wondered why the promised New Military Policy couldn’t be implemented on the first day.
Zhou Duo, a battalion commander of the Left Guard of King of Yan, who was usually arrogant and swaggering around Beiping Prefecture, today witnessing such a good opportunity but not falling into one’s own hands, without a second thought, beckoned a hundred or so men and headed straight for the regional military office.

Chapter 32: This is all King of Yan’s intention…
Inside the Regional Military office, Ping’an and Shengyong had already received news about the commotion outside, but they simply ignored it.
Sheng Yong believed that the fire was not big enough, so he added fuel to the fire by spreading the message: “The Three Guards of the King of Yan are not included in the New Military Policy and will not enjoy the benefits of the New Military Policy.”
This enraged Zhou Duo, and the soldiers behind him couldn’t believe what they were hearing.
What does that mean?
We are serving in the army, eating the court’s food, and sacrificing ourselves for the court. When it comes to implementing the New Military Policy, we are being cast aside?
Why aren’t we given the same treatment?
We are also soldiers of the Ming Dynasty, and we have the right to enjoy the benefits of the New Military Policy!
Why are we being excluded?
It’s unfair!
Soldiers have their own passions and emotions. In ordinary times, they might get worked up over a few coins and slam tables with unsheathed knives. Now, it’s not just for themselves, but also for their future generations. Can they not be anxious?
Zhou Duo and his followers caused a disturbance, shouting one by one, making people uneasy. Ping An couldn’t stand their vulgar language, so he directly ordered their arrest. More than 120 people, including Zhou Duo, were captured and tied up outside the gate of the Prefectural Military Office.
More and more people gathered to watch, and the situation became more chaotic.
King of Yan’s Residence.
Zhang Yu, Zhu Neng, Yuan Rong, and Li Rang are currently discussing how to respond to the strategies of the New Army. They haven’t proposed a plan to block the news yet when a guard hurriedly reports, “Something bad has happened! Battalion Commander Zhou Duo and his men went to the Prefectural Military Office and were captured.”
“What?”
Zhang Yu’s face darkened.
Zhou Duo is his subordinate, and Zhang Yu knows that he is just an ordinary man without much intelligence. However, he is brave and loyal, which is why Zhang Yu entrusted him with an important task. But he never expected that this guy would cause trouble for him at this critical moment.
“After hearing about Zhou Duo’s arrest, more than 500 of his subordinates went to the Prefectural Military office, demanding the release of Commander Zhou Duo.”
The guard continued to report.
Zhang Yu felt a chill running down his spine.
It wouldn’t be difficult to solve the situation if it was just Zhou Duo and a few others causing trouble, but if hundreds of people attacked the Prefectural Military office, the Prefectural Military office would have every reason to annihilate them.
What worried Zhang Yu was that the Three Guards of the King of Yan were attacking the Prefectural Military office!
If the Prefectural Military office interpreted this as a rebellion by the Three Guards of the King of Yan, they could mobilize a large army to wipe them out. no one can argue against it. Even if news of this incident reaches the ears of other vassal kings, no one will sympathize.
Because attacking the court’s government office is an act of treason and rebellion.
Kill you, no negotiation!
“Prepare the horses, quickly!”
Zhang Yu knew how serious the problem was. If he was even slightly careless, the Three Guards of the King of Yan would be annihilated! Without the Three Guards, what qualification would the King of Yan have to stay in Beiping Prefecture?
Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng hastily left the King of Yan’s residence, while Yuan Rong and Li Rang went to the backyard of the residence to discuss countermeasures with Xu Yihua.
Ping An and Sheng Yong stood outside the Prefectural Military office, with hundreds of soldiers holding long spears and carrying long knives, forming a crescent-shaped guard formation outside the Prefectural Military office. Archers stationed at higher positions drew their bows and aimed at the soldiers of the King of Yan’s Left Guard who were causing trouble.
The New Military Policy aimed to win people’s hearts.
At this moment, Ping An and Sheng Yong had gained the full trust of the upper and lower ranks of the army. In addition, The fourth policy of the New Military Policy stated that those who followed orders promptly, executed them effectively, and achieved merit could be promoted to the rank of Company Commander.
Who doesn’t want a promotion?
Who wants to remain a foot soldier forever?
As long as Ping An gives the command, all the soldiers will fearlessly charge forward to prove their loyalty to the court and their support for the New Military Policy!
Whether these people are old friends or not, it doesn’t matter anymore.
As soldiers, obeying orders is their duty!
King of Yan’s Left Guard Battalion Commander Yu Qiong led his men to the outside of the Prefectural Military office and couldn’t help but take a deep breath when he saw the situation around him. Why does this look like they want to kill someone?
Yu Qiong wasn’t a fool. He knew that his small group of people couldn’t match the forces of the Prefectural Military office. They were prepared with spears and arrows. If they forcefully entered, it would be suicide.
“Drop your weapons and don’t act recklessly!”
Yu Qiong ordered his men.
Upon hearing this, everyone dropped their weapons to the ground.
Yu Qiong, along with Company Commander Ni Qiong and others, stepped forward and stood outside the range of the spears. He shouted to Ping An and Sheng Yong, “Commanders, Zhou Duo was merely inquiring about why the New Military Policy does not include the Three Guards of the King of Yan. There is no need for such a confrontation, right?”
“Who are you?”
Sheng Yong shouted.
“I am Yu Qiong, Battalion Commander of the King of Yan’s Left Guard!”
“Seize him!”
With Sheng Yong’s order, more than ten soldiers stepped forward and immediately pinned Yu Qiong to the ground, tying him up, the Company commander on the side also tied up, and the soldiers behind them became anxious upon seeing the situation.
If the leaders are captured, how can the subordinates stand their ground in the future?
Charge!
Rescue the Company commander and Battalion Commander!
Just as the soldiers were getting agitated and ready to take action, Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng finally arrived. Zhang Yu used his whip to lash the soldiers blocking the way aside and shouted sternly, “How dare the Left Guard leave without orders? Who gave you the audacity? Where do you think this is? It’s the Prefectural Military office, is it a place you can come to? Go back!”
Zhang Yu is the top general under Zhu Di’s command, known for his care for the soldiers and his high military prestige.
In the past, as long as Zhang Yu gave the order, everyone would charge into battle without hesitation and die on the battlefield without a second thought. But today, these soldiers didn’t want to leave!
“General Zhang, we want the New Military Policy!”
“That’s right, Commander Zhou and Commander Yu were only standing up for us!”
“The new military policy of the court favors and rewards the soldiers. Why don’t we deserve to enjoy the benefits of the new military policy? It’s unfair!”
“Yes, unfair! We are soldiers of the Great Ming too!”
“Please, General Zhang, uphold justice for us!”
The soldiers knelt down one by one.
Zhang Yu trembled as he looked at the proud soldiers now kneeling before him.
The New Military Policy was a matter concerning the soldiers themselves, their families, and their future generations. Today, they knelt down, not just for themselves but also for the sake of their families and future descendants!
Zhang Yu was well aware of the power of the New Military Policy. It could transform soldiers who were originally loyal to the vassal kings into soldiers loyal to the court!
If in the future, Zhu Di wanted to seize power again and act against the court, these soldiers would not follow his orders!
Why?
Because Zhu Di wouldn’t care about their future generations!
Because Zhu Di wouldn’t provide them with generous retirement conditions!
Because Zhu Di wouldn’t have the money to support their families medical expenses!
Because if they died, Zhu Di wouldn’t have enough money to compensate them.
…
Zhang Yu could imagine that if the New Military Policy were implemented within the Three Guards of King of Yan, the soldiers would pledge their allegiance to the court. If one day Zhu Di rebelled against the court, the first enemy is not the main army of the court, but his own soldiers!
They would never dare to be enemies with the court because they were fighting for themselves, their families, and their future descendants!
No usable troops!
No obedient troops!
How could they fight a war like this?
Zhang Yu couldn’t fight such a war!
Even if Xu Da and Chang Yuchun came back to life, they couldn’t fight this kind of war!
However, if the New Military Policy wasn’t implemented within the Three Guards of King of Yan, how could they be content?
He could handle the current disturbance.
But what about tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow?
People are not troubled by scarcity but by inequality[1]Tl’s note: Its Chinese idiom from the analects. This is the nature of the human heart.
In the past, everyone ate the same Chinese cabbage, and there was nothing to complain about.
But now, some people are eating meat while I still eat cabbage. How can that be satisfying?
Their fellow brothers who joined the army together will be able to retire and enjoy their lives after twenty years of service. When they think about themselves, even if they die in the military camp, they won’t get any benefits. Who would have the motivation to train?
People’s hearts are restless, and big problems will arise sooner or later.
Zhang Yu felt that this was a dead end, tightly constricting him, leaving him breathless.
Unraveling it was not an option. Leaving it unresolved was also not an option!
Zhu Neng rode his horse to Zhang Yu’s side and whispered, “Why not direct your anger toward the court?”
Zhang Yu’s eyes lit up. If he could shift the blame for not implementing the New Military Policy in the Three Guards of King of Yan onto the court, it would be seen as discrimination and disrespect toward the Three Guards of King of Yan, as if they were not considered soldiers of the Ming Dynasty.
With a little guidance, if the Three Guards of the King of Yan developed resentment toward the court, these soldiers would become completely loyal to the King of Yan and be willing to rebel with him!
This move is ruthless!
Zhang Yu glanced approvingly at Zhu Neng and shouted to the crowd, “The New Military Policy has won the hearts of the soldiers, but the court has unjustly excluded the Three Guards of King of Yan. It is inappropriate. I will personally go to the military court to ask the Prefectural Military office what they are thinking, why they are unfair to the Three Guards, and why they are unfair to us generals and soldiers!”
His words were greatly appreciated by the soldiers of the Three Guards of King of Yan.
Zhang Yu dismounted and walked toward the Prefectural Military office.
Ping An and Sheng Yong ordered the soldiers to make way.
Ping An stepped forward and greeted with clasped hands, “Brother Shimei, it’s been many years, and you’re still in good health.”
Zhang Yu, whose courtesy name was Shimei, was familiar with Ping An, who had accompanied Zhu Di on his expedition to the north along with Zhang Yu, Zhu Neng, and others.
With a cold face, Zhang Yu shouted loudly, “Ping An, we can catch up later. Today, I came here to ask why the New Military Policy is not implemented in the Three Guards of King of Yan?”
Ping An laughed heartily and said, “Since General Zhang asked, I will answer.”
After speaking, Ping An climbed onto a platform and scanned the onlookers, the soldiers of Beiping, and the Three Guards of King of Yan. He shouted loudly, “The New Military Policy was created by His Majesty, and the capital garrison was the first to implement it. Both the military and the people are satisfied! His Majesty appreciates the frontier soldiers’ lifelong service in countless battles and desires to implement the New Army Policy throughout the entire army as soon as possible!”
“His Majesty knows well that the Three Guards of King of Yan have been fighting and working hard year-round, and they should be the first to enjoy the benefits of the New Army Policy. His Majesty personally went to the King of Yan Mansion in the capital to entrust King of Yan with the implementation of the New Military Policy within the Three Guards, and then it would be extended to the other guards of Beiping.”
“However, King of Yan declined repeatedly and refused to implement the New Military Policy within the Three Guards. Even the persuasion of the Chief Commander of the Central Army, Xu Huizu, was in vain. His Majesty then transferred the New Military Policy to the Beiping Prefectural Military office, giving them full responsibility for its implementation, excluding the Three Guards!”
“The Three Guards’ exclusion from the New Army Policy is not because His Majesty disapproves, not because the court disapproves, not because the Prefetural Military office disapproves, but because King of Yan disapproves! Let me make it clear here to all of you, to all the military and civilians of Beiping, as long as King of Yan gives his approval, the Three Guards can immediately enjoy all the benefits of the New Military Policy!”
“Is there anything else you want to inquire about?! Brother Shimei, are you satisfied with this answer? Haha, now it’s clear, isn’t it? This is all King of Yan’s intention…”
After finishing his words, Ping An stepped down from the platform and paid no attention to Zhang Yu and the others. He went straight back to the office.
Sheng Yong approached Zhang Yu and clasped his fists, saying, “General Zhang, the court has received urgent reports about this matter. It is indeed the King of Yan’s refusal and not the court or His Majesty’s disapproval. But regardless of the reason, these soldiers have intruded into the Prefectural Military office without authorization, and they cannot be let off lightly!”
” Then, please follow the law and proceed accordingly, Commander Sheng.”
Zhang Yu had never felt so frustrated before. His face was burning, feeling a sense of shame!
Sheng Yong looked at Zhang Yu’s stumbling figure and sneered. He glanced at the bound people and ordered, “Fifty strokes for each person, and if there’s a next time, they will all be beheaded!”
Fifty strokes!
The crowd shuddered.
Although the soldiers were physically fit, if they were struck with full force, let alone fifty strokes, even twenty strokes would be enough to beat a person to death.
Furthermore, these soldiers who are wielding the sticks have just enjoyed the benefits of the new military policy. They are full of energy and may have exerted excessive force, but it can be understood. As for whether personal grudges are mixed in, that is unknown.
Over a hundred people, fifty strokes each, resulted in the deaths of four: two Company Commander and two Battalion Commander.

Chapter 33: Disunity of the Three Guards of the King of Yan
The pain on the surface can be resisted with strong willpower. But what if the will collapses?
The soldiers of the Three Guards understood clearly, as did the residents of Beiping. The reason why the new military policy were not implemented in the Three Guards of King of Yan was not due to the court or the emperor, but because of the King of Yan himself!
It was the King of Yan who refused to allow the new military policy in the Three Guards!
He rejected such enormous benefits!
The strikes of the sticks on their buttocks were painful, very painful, to the point of making people want to cry.
Some people were heartbroken.
Some people sobbed quietly.
Some people looked up to the sky, tears streaming down their faces.
Why?
Your Highness King of Yan, why did you not allow the new military policy in the Three Guards,
King of Yan!
As your strongest force, we have followed you through life and death, battled on the battlefield. Are we not even given the opportunity to enjoy the the new military policy and secure blessings for our future generations?
Throughout our lives of countless battles and countless injuries, for the sake of our homes and our country, we have braved the wind and snow, traveled through thousands of miles of desert, and stepped over mountains of corpses and seas of blood. And in the end, with just a few words from you, you discarded all of our interests?
Why?
Your highness, King of Yan!
Weren’t you always the most considerate of us?
Why can’t you just nod your head?
The feeling of disappointment spread among Three Guards of King of Yan.
Zhang Yu led the group away. When they arrived, they were full of energy and fearless, displaying an arrogant attitude towards death. When they left, each one of them appeared soulless and lifeless, like walking corpses.
The unity of people’s hearts has been shattered.
Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng, realizing the seriousness of the situation, quickly gathered the leaders of the Three Guards of the King of Yan for discussions. With the approval of Consort Xu Yihua, they issued martial law orders, explicitly stating that:
Anyone who the camp without orders shall be executed!
Anyone who discusses the new military policy shall be executed!
Anyone who expresses dissatisfaction with the army shall be executed!
Anyone who slackens in training and disobeys orders shall be executed!
When the order of execution was conveyed to the Three Guards barracks, not a single soldier said anything. They remained silent like a ghost, and numbly accepting it.
The actions of the King of Yan chilled the hearts of the Three Guards from top to bottom.
No one could understand why such a new military policy should be rejected by the wise King of Yan, even a blind or deaf person would have agreed.
The respect for the King of Yan, vanished after Ping An’s speech and the spreading of the news.
Zhu Neng led more than a hundred people and broke out of Beiping City, heading directly south. He heard that Zhu Di had arrived in Jinan, and after a few days he would arrive at Beiping.
But Zhu Neng couldn’t wait for a few days. Currently, the new military policy were being implemented in Beiping Prefecture on a large scale, and even Shanhai Pass had started adopting the same policy.
In order to facilitate the smooth implementation of the new military policy, although the court did not allocate funds and provisions from the capital, they allowed Zhang Bing, the Beiping Administration Commissioner, to use the summer taxes that had not yet been transported to the capital and allocate them directly to the military garrison and various guards.
The increased demand for food and meat in the military garrison directly stimulated animal husbandry and farming in the surrounding areas of Beiping Prefecture.
Upon seeing this, Zhang Bing encouraged the various counties and prefectures of Beiping Prefecture to expand animal husbandry and farming, especially for pigs, sheep, cattle, chickens, ducks, geese, etc. To dispel the concerns of farmers, Zhang Bing posted notices stating that the prices would be based on the market prices of September in the thirty-first year of the Hongwu era. In the future, the army would purchase them at no less than the September market prices.
In terms of pork, the market price in September was nine wens per catty. An adult pig weighing around 200 catty would be worth 1,800 wens, nearly two taels of silver.
Although the farmers had to work harder, wouldn’t they earn more income?
Wouldn’t it be easier when it came time to pay taxes in the future?
Zhang Bing’s actions greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of farmers in animal husbandry and laid the foundation for ensuring the soldiers’ food supply.
Whether it was “Meat” administration commissioner Zhang Bing or the “New Military Policy Envoy,” Ping An, they were constantly exploring new paths for development.
Zhu Yunwen had given these two individuals significant authority. Zhang Bing wanted to loosen restrictions on merchants and recognize their official status, no longer requiring them to be affiliated with other households. He was preparing to create conditions for the development of commerce in Beiping.
Zhang Bing wrote a memorial and sent someone to deliver it to the capital. At the same time, he began the process of lifting the ban on commerce.
Provincial Administration office.
Zhang Bing gathered the main merchants from various industries in Beiping, including some traveling merchants and peddlers, and carefully listened to their demands.
The merchants’ demands were not many; they only hoped that the court would lift the ban on commerce and allow them to freely engage in business. If the court agreed, the merchants were willing to accept a tax rate of 25 to 1, instead of the current 30 to 1. [1]TL’s note: the tax rate 25 to 1 is simple, means you have to pay 1 dollar for each 25 dollars you earn.
Zhang Bing did not fully agree to the merchants’ demands. He simply informed all the merchants that within the jurisdiction of Beiping Prefecture, the Commissioner at all levels would no longer restrict the merchant household and would allow merchants to engage in business freely.
As for the issue of commercial taxes, it would be decided by the court.
After hearing this, the merchants were overjoyed. Although the scope was limited, it was still the first step.
Of course, Zhang Bing did not lose out either. By loosening the household registration policy, he gained the support of the merchants. When Zhang Bing mentioned the current difficulties of having an abundant food supply in Beiping but limited silver, these merchants pledged their support and guaranteed to purchase the grain at the government’s specified price with silver.
Zhang Bing would convert the tax grain into tax silver, keeping thirty percent for local use, and the remaining seventy percent would be sent to the capital.
On September 14th, Zhu Di entered Beiping Prefecture looking exhausted, not even sitting in a carriage.
When he left Beiping, Zhu Di was accompanied by soldiers and civilians, with a grand procession. But upon his return, everything had changed. Even the soldiers guarding the city gate only gave a simple salute to Zhu Di, without the smiling faces of the past.
Zhu Di was mentally and physically exhausted. On his way back, Crown prince Zhu Gaochi fell ill, delaying them for two days in Jinan. Shortly after leaving Jinan, they encountered Zhu Neng and learned about Ping An’s implementation of the new military policy, Three Guards of King of Yan creating disturbances in Provincial Military office, Martial law implementation and other things.
The situation was worse than Zhu Di had imagined.
Zhu Di did not expect that Ping’an would implement the New Military Policy in such a way that it became widely known throughout the city. He also did not expect that Ping’an would inform the world about his prohibition of the New Military Policy in the Three Guards!
This is not Ping’an’s method!
Zhu Di understood that behind all this was Zhu Yunwen!
It must be Zhu Yunwen who informed Ping’an about how to operate this matter, and signaled Ping’an to provoke dissatisfaction among the Three Guards of King of Yan, making the situation escalate, and finally making him take the blame himself, causing the Three Guards of the King of Yan to lose cohesion and loyalty!
At this moment, Zhu Di finally understood that Zhu Yunwen did not intend to weaken the vassal kings, but he intended to take away the will and courage of every soldier to resist the court!
King of Yan’s residence.
Zhu Di gathered all the core personnel, including the Yan Mountain Three Guards generals, and asked, “How are the Three Guards now?”
Zhang Yu’s eyes were sunken, he forced himself to be alert and said, “Your Highness, the soldiers have strong emotions, everyone yearns for the New Military policy. If this issue is not resolved, there may be turmoil.”
“Ah, New Military Policy, New Military Policy!”
Zhu Di gritted his teeth. He had been pondering all the way but couldn’t find a solution.
If Ping’an had only promoted the New Military Policy within the military garrison and the news did not reach the ears of the Three Guards of King of Yan, they could have sealed off the information. But Ping’an’s methods were too cunning. Not only did he make the entire Beiping Prefecture aware, but he also left a deep impression on the Three Guards!
“Your Highness, if we can come up with a better policy, not only can we regain the trust of the Three Guards, but we can also attract soldiers from the various guards in Beiping Prefecture and gain more support.”
Yuan Rong said confidently.
“Idiot!”
Zhu Gaochi muttered.
“What did you say?”
Yuan Rong jumped up and pointed at Zhu Gaozhi, shouting.
Zhu Gaochi coldly looked at Yuan Rong and said, “I said you’re an idiot! Have you forgotten that the Three Guards of King of Yan are under the court’s control, and they are fed by the court’s provisions. What policies can we come up with? What power do we have to propose policies? Once the Yan Prince’s Mansion gets involved in logistics, believe it or not, the Provincial Military office can immediately march to our doorstep!”
“Besides, how much financial resources does the King of Yan’s Mansion have to support the expenses of 80,000 soldiers? According to the New Military Policy, those who serve for twenty years can retire, and those who pass the assessment after twenty years of service will have their salaries doubled, and then doubled again after five years. Go and calculate how many soldiers in the Three Guards of King of Yan are veterans of twenty or thirty years?”
“Some of them joined the military at the age of fifteen or sixteen. Now they are only in their forties, in their prime. Who dares to let them retire? If they don’t retire, can you provide enough money and provisions? Take Qiu Fu as an example. He has been in the military for thirty-five years. According to the New Military Policy, he should receive over a thousand taels of annual salary. Can you afford that?”
Yuan Rong’s face turned pale after being scolded by Zhu Gaochi.
Although Zhu Gaochi was physically bloated and had mobility issues, he was a very insightful and capable person.
Imitating the New Military Policy, there is neither legal support nor the necessary conditions to support it.
Yuan Rong’s ideas are too naive and overly idealistic.
He wouldn’t pay attention to Yuan Rong if it weren’t for his good looks and the fact that he was Yuan Hong’s son. How could his father have betrothed his eldest sister, Princess Yong’an County Zhu Yuying, to him?
In ordinary days, he was somewhat arrogant, but Zhu Gaochi, out of respect for his sister’s face, would not pay any attention to him. However, now that the King of Yan’s Mansion is facing life and death, in this critical and perilous moment, he unexpectedly pretends to be suave and holds all the cards of wisdom.
If you don’t have a brain, don’t pretend to have one.
Otherwise, when it comes to a face slap, it will be a resounding slap.
Zhu Gaoxu and Zhu Gaosui looked at Zhu Gaochi and didn’t object. Although they had some conflicts with Zhu Gaochi on ordinary days, they had to admit that his analysis was correct.
Zhu Di stood up, rubbed his temples, and said, “If Dao Yan were here, we would certainly not be so helpless.”
“Your Highness, did master Dao Yan’s leave any strategies behind?”
Zhu Neng asked.
The letter Dao Yan left for Zhu Di was handed over to him personally by Zhu Neng. Zhu Neng and Zhang Yu were not aware of its contents.
Zhu Di frowned and said, “He didn’t leave behind any strategies, but he recommended someone to me.”
“Who?”
Zhu Gaochi and the others asked.
Zhu Di looked at everyone and said slowly, “Jin Zhong.”
Everyone was puzzled.
Zhu Di sighed and said, “In the early years, I arranged for Dao Yan to seek out talented strategists. First, there was Yuan Zhongche, and then Jin Zhong. You already know about Yuan Zhongche, a master of metaphysics. But this Jin Zhong is even more extraordinary. He not only understands yin and yang but is also knowledgeable in military tactics. He is a talented individual.”
“Father, what are we waiting for? Where is Jin Zhong?”
Zhu Gaoxu quickly asked.
Zhu Di sat down, took a sip of tea, and gradually calmed down. He looked at Zhu Gaoxu and said, “”You go to a secluded alley and invite the fortune teller there into the mansion. Remember, it should be done discreetly to avoid attracting attention.”.

Chapter 34: Zhu Gaoxu’s Divination, Zhu Di’s Counterattack
In a quiet alley, Zhu Gaoxu looked at the middle-aged man sitting at the fortune-telling stall. The man wore dark clothes with a patch of white cloth, giving him a mismatched appearance. On the table lay an old book “Classic of Changes,” and beside it was a sign that read “Fortune Telling and Destiny Reading.”
“Are you Jin Zhong?” Zhu Gaoxu asked, somewhat skeptical.
Jin Zhong squinted his eyes and looked at Zhu Gaoxu, then stood up and bowed, saying, “Indeed, I am. Might I ask if the young master is here on a recommendation?”
Zhu Gaoxu nodded slightly and said, “Yes, I am. Tell me, can one’s destiny truly be calculated?”
Jin Zhong smiled and observed Zhu Gaoxu before responding, “All things and appearances can be analyzed, revealing their inner essence. To know one thing is to glimpse another, and seeking further understanding is not a difficult task. Personal destiny lies between yin and yang, within the five elements, and it can indeed be determined.”
Zhu Gaoxu nodded and took out a silver ingot, placing it on the table, saying, “Then, please calculate mine.”
Jin Zhong stroked his beard, collected the silver ingot, and asked, “Does the young master wish to calculate through divination or Literomancy?”
Considering the current situation, Zhu Gaoxu thought that if he made any slight mistake, there would be no place for him in the King of Yan’s mansion. Although he was the prince, he lacked a good strategy and could only wait anxiously as Zhu Yunwen gradually encroached. What would his future hold?
With a sigh, Zhu Gaoxu said, “Let’s do Literomancy.”
Jin Zhong prepared his writing materials and inquired, “What aspect of your life would you like to analyze: marriage, wealth, or career?”
Zhu Gaoxu picked up the pen and wrote a character. The upper part of the character was “人” (person), and the lower part was “十” (ten). He said, “Let’s analyze my destiny.”
Jin Zhong glanced at Zhu Gaoxu, lowered his head, picked up the paper, and carefully examined the character “仐.” He smiled faintly and said, “This character is quite interesting, young master. ‘仐’ can also be pronounced as ‘今’ and means ‘today’ or ‘this moment.’ It is said that those who lack foresight will encounter immediate worries. Young master, you are concerned about the present, which can be considered a burden. ‘仐’ can also be pronounced as ‘伞,’ which means ‘umbrella’ or ‘shelter.’ It appears that young master holds a prominent position with a protective shelter, no danger at the moment, yet…”
“Yet what?” Zhu Gaoxu asked, astonished, as he raised an eyebrow and looked at Jin Zhong.
Jin Zhong continued, “However, outside the umbrella, there is wind and rain. If the wind picks up, you may get wet.”
Zhu Gaoxu’s eyebrows furrowed as he looked at Jin Zhong, amazed by his words. Jin Zhong’s analysis made sense. At present, he faced numerous troubles and obstacles.
The recent incident of the New Military Policy being exposed had put all the soldiers in a state of waiting for his father’s explanation. A single mishandling could lead to the immediate disintegration of the Three Guards, resulting in a loss of military morale.
As for the reference to having a protective shelter, wasn’t it indicating his status as the prince with a vassal king above him?
No dangers at the moment?
Speaking of the present moment, although not in a perilous situation, one is still amidst the storms. If turbulence arises, even if one has a shelter, it would be impossible to escape unscathed.
“Is there more?”
Zhu Gaoxu suppressed his astonishment and inquired.
Jin Zhong pointed to the character “仐” and said, “Young master, observe closely. The upper part of this character is ‘人’ (person), and the lower part is ‘十’ (ten). Looking from below, the character ‘十’ represents vertical and horizontal directions, connecting the North and the South, and linking the East and the West. It signifies the four corners, which are all territories of kings. If my analysis is correct, young master, you possess an extraordinary background and are closely related to the imperial family. Your future path should be that of a vassal king or even higher than a vassal king.”
Zhu Gaoxu furrowed his brows slightly and pondered. “Higher than a vassal king? What does that mean?”
According to the regulations of the imperial court, if his father passed away, his eldest brother Zhu Gaochi would undoubtedly inherit the title of King of Yan, and he would only be the Prince of Gaoyang. There were only two possibilities for him to become a vassal King:
First, if both his father and eldest brother passed away, and his eldest brother without leaving any heirs, he would naturally succeed the title of Prince of Yan.
Second, if his father led everyone to conquer the world, overthrowing Zhu Yunwen, and becoming the emperor, wouldn’t he become a vassal king then?
Higher than a vassal king?
What could be above a vassal king?
The emperor!
Could it be that Jin Zhong is implying that he possesses the fortune of an emperor?
Zhu Gaoxu’s eyes sparkled as he looked at Jin Zhong and asked, “Is there more?”
Jin Zhong calmly said, “Furthermore, looking at the upper part of ‘仐,’ there is the character ‘人’ (person) above it. A person stands above the four corners, indicating that young master will hold a high position in the future. However, it is somewhat regrettable…”
“What’s unfortunate?”
Zhu Gaoxu quickly asked.
Jin Zhong pointed to the character “仐” on the paper and said, “It’s a pity that this character ‘人’ (person) hasn’t fully emerged.”
Zhu Gaoxu’s cheeks twitched slightly as he stared at Jin Zhong and shouted in a stern voice, “What do you mean?”
Jin Zhong put away the paper, looked at Zhu Gaoxu, and calmly said, “When one hasn’t yet achieved success, one should strive even harder. In life, there are destined moments that should not be ignored. Young master, ahead of you lies a promising future, so why not take a walk and see for yourself?.”
Seeing that Jin Zhong didn’t want to say more, Zhu Gaoxu suppressed his doubts. He took out the jade pendant his father had given him and placed it on the table, respectfully saying, “I am Zhu Gaoxu. I request your assistance in freeing the King of Yan’s Residence from its predicament.”
“The Prince?” Jin Zhong was taken aback and quickly stepped forward to pay his respects, saying, “I have been ignorant and failed to recognize Your Highness. I have offended you earlier. Please forgive me, Your Highness.”
Zhu Gaoxu helped Jin Zhong up and solemnly said, “I have come here today on behalf of my father to invite you, sir, to the residence for a discussion.”
Jin Zhong chuckled and said, “It must be about New Military Policy, right?”
Zhu Gaoxu nodded solemnly and asked, “Do you have a solution, sir?”
Jin Zhong shook his head slightly and said, “This matter needs to be discussed with the King of Yan before a decision can be made. Your Highness, please allow me to put away these utensils.”
In the King of Yan’s residence,
Zhu Di invited Jin Zhong to take a seat, but Jin Zhong hesitated and declined several times before sitting to Zhu Di’s right.
Zhu Di recounted to Jin Zhong his rejection of the New Military Policy to the Three Guards in the capital. He then said, “Currently, the Three Guards are filled with anxiety, and some even call me Zhu Di a merciless butcher who disregards human sentiment. Hehe, if this continues, I can only return to the capital to guard the mausoleum.”
Jin Zhong contemplated for a while and said seriously, “Your Highness, the New Military Policy is not without its weaknesses. There is still room for maneuver.”
Zhu Di quickly stood up, made a deep bow, and said, “Please assist me, sir.”
Jin Zhong quickly stood up and moved to the side. He couldn’t bear the formalities of the prince. If he sat there arrogantly and endured it, he might end up getting killed one day.
Being cautious, understanding etiquette, and understanding others’ thoughts are Jin Zhong’s ways of survival.
Jin Zhong returned the courtesy and then said seriously, “Your Highness, the New Military Policy may seem advantageous, but it also has significant flaws.”
“Oh? What do you mean?”
Zhu Di pulled Jin Zhong to sit down and asked.
Jin Zhong said, “The New Military Policy, stirring people’s hearts, but ultimately, it all comes down to the word “interest.” The Emperor uses benefits to motivate and gain the loyalty of the army. However, the Emperor is still relatively young. After implementing the strategy in the capital for just over a month, he dares to expand it to areas like North Zhili. This will bring about a significant problem.”
“What problem?” asked Zhu Di, pondering.
In a deep voice, Jin Zhong replied, “The problem of soaring military expenses and insufficient food supplies! King of Yan has been in charge of the troops for years and knows the tremendous cost. Although the New Military Policy seems generous, it is not sustainable. You see, where can we find enough meat in the northern regions? How much livestock is there around Beiping Prefecture and beyond? In the frigid north, how can we obtain such a large quantity of livestock?”
“Forget about meat for now, let’s talk about the increased food supplies. How much will it cost? Beiping Prefecture currently has only 700,000 stones of grain in storage, but it needs to supply not only the 80,000 troops of Three Guards but also the 50,000 soldiers of the Provincial Military office, and over 100,000 civilians. Not long ago, Sheng Yong also brought in an additional 30,000 soldiers from various guards outside the city. How much food will all these people need?”
“The food supplies have barely been balanced before, but now with an additional 30,000 soldiers, there will be people going hungry. Once the court fails to provide enough, even a slight flaw in the New Military Policy will expose vulnerabilities everywhere. The New Military Policy will become a laughingstock!”
“At that time, the soldiers will voice their complaints and will not be willing to remain loyal to a Monarch with empty promises. Then, when the King of Yan raises his arm and calls, the soldiers of the world will respond in unison, and the great plan can be realized!”
Zhu Di, Zhu Gaochi, Zhu Gaoxu, Zhang Yu, and others listened to Jin Zhong’s words and praised him one after another.
It must be said that Jin Zhong’s words hit the core of Zhu Yunwen’s vulnerability.
Implementing the New Military Policy is easy, but sticking to it is not. Once problems arise, the soldiers will surely cause trouble. These soldiers are professional warriors with weapons, and one day they may rebel!
From this perspective, things are not looking too good.
Zhu Di breathed a sigh of relief and smiled, “Before Dao Yan left, he recommended you to the King of Yan’s Mansion. Today, I have heard your insightful words, you are indeed extraordinary. However, I would like to know, when do you think the flaws in the New Army’s strategy will be revealed?”
Jin Zhong calculated and said, “Within two years.”
Zhu Di frowned. Two years seemed a bit long, and he might not be able to wait that long. However, if there is a real opportunity, waiting for another two years would be acceptable!
“Then, how do we solve the current dilemma?” Zhu Gaochi asked.
Jin Zhong respectfully clasped his hands to Zhu Gaochi and said, “Your Highness, what you asked is the most urgent matter at present. This matter requires the cooperation of the King of Yan…”
The Three Guards’ drill ground.
Zhu Di wore his armor and military robe, imposing and majestic. The 80,000 soldiers of the Three Guards lined up in a disciplined manner, and for a while, no one dared to speak.
Although many people dared to speak ill of Zhu Di on ordinary days, no one dared to directly confront him when facing him!
Zhu Di stood on a high platform, drew his sword from his waist, and threw it fiercely, shouting loudly, “Who wants to kill me, Zhu Di? Come! Today, I will stand here and let him kill me. Who dares to take a step forward!”
Majestic and awe-inspiring, no one dared to move!
Zhu Di angrily shouted, “Many of you have followed me for ten years, twenty years, or even longer! What kind of person am I? Can’t you see clearly? Just because of a New Military Policy, you lost your souls. With such soldiers, how can we go into battle and kill enemies? How can we be loyal to our country? Haha, some say I am a bloodthirsty butcher. Today, even if butcher you incompetent soldiers, the court won’t say a word!”
“The New Military Policy is the National Policy of the Great Ming! What is a national policy? It means that wherever the territory of the Great Ming is, this policy should be implemented! Do you think you are outside the realm of the Great Ming? Qiu Fu, tell me, where are we?”
“We are in the Great Ming’s Beiping!”
“Have you all understood clearly? We are in the Great Ming’s Beiping! Can we do without the New Military Policy? No, we can’t! What are you losing and giving up? Why do I not allow the new military policy to enter Three Guards? Because I know that this national policy is full of flaws and may not be feasible!”
“Let’s talk about the Family Affairs Department, Can it be established just because we say so? After it is established, can it immediately solve the problems for parents? How many people will the Family Affairs Department have? Can it manage the families of tens of thousands of soldiers?”
“Let’s talk about the medical funds! If we calculate it as one or two taels per soldier per year, that’s two million taels. Last year, the total money in the Great Ming’s treasury was only three million taels. Can we take out two million taels as medical funds? Do you think it’s feasible?”
“This confused New Military Policy is nothing but a passing illusion, deceiving your eyes! This strategy is not feasible, and not sustainable. I know the problems involved, that’s why I hesitate to let you join the New Military Policy. I fear that you will fall from heaven to hell!”

Chapter 35: The King of Yan’s Mansion Opens a Farm
Zhu Di’s military might was formidable, his voice resounding like thunder, shaking people’s hearts.
All the soldiers looked at Zhu Di, following his gaze and listening to the thunderous voice. Gradually, they came to understand that the reason why the new military policy was not implemented in the Three Guards was for their own good.
The new military policy was like a reflection in a mirror, beautiful but temporary, unrealistic. It could be implemented today and revoked the next day. The King of Yan was afraid that everyone would be disappointed and harbor resentment towards the court, which is why he didn’t allow the new military policy in the Three Guards.
Upon careful consideration, what the King of Yan said made sense. Throughout history, when have soldiers had such favorable conditions in war?
Even during the prosperous times of the Han and Tang dynasties, such conditions did not exist, let alone in the Ming Dynasty.
From this perspective, the new military policy was nothing more than a result of Emperor Jianwen’s lack of experience and hasty governance, a means to gather support.
Zhu Di became emotional, his voice choked with tears as he shouted, “I have been considering your well-being, sharing the burdens and difficulties of the court, and exerting all my efforts for the sake of Great Ming. Is this the gratitude and curses I receive in return? Fine, since you don’t trust me, from today onwards, the King of Yan’s Three Guards are free to decide their own path. Those who want the new military policy can leave the military camp and go join Ping An. I, Zhu Di, will not stop you!”
“We won’t leave! We pledge our unwavering loyalty to the King of Yan!”
Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng shouted loudly.
“We won’t leave! We pledge our unwavering loyalty to the King of Yan!”
Countless soldiers roared, their voices echoing in all directions.
Zhu Di raised his sword high, pointing it at the sky, and shouted, “The new military policy is full of flaws. Within two years, there will be chaos. Once the flaws appear, the two million soldiers of Great Ming will surely voice their grievances and blame the court. We bear a heavy responsibility to defend Ming and protect our land.”
“Soldiers, listen up! From this day forth, the Three Guards will strengthen their training. If chaos befalls Ming, it will be us, the Three Guards of the King of Yan, who will restore order to the realm! We will rectify the state and protect the lives of our people! Fight!”
“Fight!”
“Fight!”
“Fight!”
The Three Guards’ loyalty roared like thunder.
Zhu Di firmly held the soldiers of the Three Guards in his hands using his own methods. He instilled in them a strong sense of mission and righteousness, making them believe that everything they did was for the sake of Great Ming and its people!
The King of Yan’s Residence.
Zhu Di led his three sons to express their gratitude to Jin Zhong using a grand ceremony, and Jin Zhong quickly knelt down.
Zhu Gaochi and others were well aware that if it weren’t for Jin Zhong’s strategies and wisdom, the Three Guards of the King of Yan’s mansion might no longer obey the orders from the mansion. Now, no matter how the new military policy was implemented, the Three Guards would not be shaken.
These core members remained Zhu Di’s most reliable force.
Zhu Di arranged for Jin Zhong to work in the King of Yan’s mansion and handed him the latest intelligence from Beiping. With a furrowed brow, Zhu Di said, “It seems that the issue of lack of provisions for the new military policy has been resolved.”
Jin Zhong looked at Zhu Di in astonishment.
Zhu Di handed a piece of intelligence to Jin Zhong and said, “The Emperor has allowed the Beiping Administration Commissioner, Zhang Bing, to handle the summer and autumn grain supplies on-site. Some will be allocated to the military camps, some will be stored as reserves, and the rest will be sold to merchants in exchange for silver. Thirty percent of the silver will go to the Governor’s Office, and the remaining seventy percent will be delivered to the capital.”
Jin Zhong was secretly surprised and pondered for a while before saying, “Your Highness, those behind the Emperor are quite formidable. This method indeed provides ample provisions for the new military policy. However, the immense cost of the new military policy lies not in its initial implementation but in its long-term execution. From my perspective, given the current foundation of Great Ming, it is impossible to sustain the long-term implementation of the new military policy.”
Zhu Di had some understanding of the amount of grain and money in Ming.
According to Zhu Yunwen’s approach, the new military policy would sooner or later encounter trouble.
But the problem lay in the words “sooner or later.”
If it happened too soon, he wouldn’t be prepared.
If it happened too late, Zhu Yunwen would be prepared.
“Your Highness, it is better to be prepared in advance than to dig a well when thirsty.”
Jin Zhong spoke cautiously.
Zhu Di nodded solemnly and then frowned, saying, “Provisions can be resolved to some extent, but what about weapons and equipment?”
Without weapons and equipment, they couldn’t go to the battlefield brandishing bamboo sticks right? Besides, these soldiers hadn’t trained in Dog beating staff techniques, so it wouldn’t be suitable. But swords, spears, and halberds wouldn’t just magically appear out of stones.
If you wanted weapons, you couldn’t just buy them from a weapons store. No one ran such shops in this era.
You couldn’t go to a blacksmith shop for custom-made weapons, the blacksmith can forge a kitchen knife, If you asked them to forge weapons, it would cost their lives. Even if you threatened their entire family, demanding them to forge swords, it would take ages to arm a large army with just a couple of swords per day.
They needed to establish a large-scale weapons workshop, with specific requirements, that ensured secrecy.
But where should the weapons workshop be located?
Inside the Three Guards’ military camp?
No, who knew how many court spies there were? If the news leaked, one might end up being assigned to a workshop to forge iron.
Outside the city?
No, it wouldn’t be secure.
Inside the city?
No, Ping’an and Shengyong were both too formidable.
After much consideration, Zhu Di suddenly had an idea. They could build it within the King of Yan’s mansion. No one would dare to search the mansion, so safety wouldn’t be an issue. Moreover, everyone within the residence was loyal to him, making it less likely for news to leak.
Most importantly, they could keep an elite team within the residence as a precaution against unforeseen circumstances.
Zhu Di was also skilled at seizing opportunities. Zhang Bing, you were encouraging the poultry industry, right? As the King of Yan, it was only natural for me, Zhu Di, to actively respond and set an example.
Not long after, a huge poultry farm was established on the western side of the King of Yan’s mansion. Chickens, ducks, geese, and pigs—anything that could make noise—were brought in.
Raising livestock on the ground, improve the food supply.
Forging weapons underground, hiding a military force.
While Zhu Di was squatting in the chilly poultry farm, contemplating why mother hens don’t lay eggs in winter, Zhu Yunwen, who was in the capital, finally met the legendary Black-robed Prime Minister, Dao Yan.
Dao Yan had been in the capital for over a month, but he spent his time reciting scriptures and performing Buddhist rituals at the Qianning Palace for the Empress Dowager. After completing his duties, he would go to rest at the Linggu Temple.
Zhu Yunwen was busy dealing with the issues of the New Military Policy and the Single Whip Method, and he had no energy to pay attention to Dao Yan. Moreover, having this expert in Machiavellianism and conspiracies stay in the capital couldn’t raise a big storm.
Dao Yan was the fuse, and Zhu Di was the cannonball.
Now that Zhu Yunwen had removed this fuse, he hoped that Zhu Di would restrain himself and submit. However, according to the intelligence brought by Zhang Bing and Ping An, Zhu Di had already stabilized the Three Guards and found a new fuse.
When Zhu Yunwen saw Zhang Bing praising Zhu Di for supporting the poultry industry and setting an example for the people, he almost burst out laughing.
In the end, Zhu Di still wanted to rebel. This guy had thrown away his sincerity. With each setback and admonishment, he refused to listen. In that case, Zhu Yunwen couldn’t blame himself for taking stronger measures.
On October 16th, Zhu Yunwen ordered Zhang Bing, Ping An, and Sheng Yong to inform the Beiping Prefecture that the deadline for the New Military Policy was set for the end of November. If the King of Yan didn’t agree, all the materials prepared for the Three Guards in the new military policy would be entirely transferred to Liaodong, and for the next ten years, there would be no consideration of incorporating them into the New Military Policy.
On the same day, a secret order was issued for the Great Ming Security Bureau to send thirty people to Beiping, responsible for investigating Zhu Di’s activities and seeking opportunities to persuade the leaders of the Three Guards.
On the seventeenth day, Zhu Yunwen appointed Tie Xuan as the commander of Jinan, fully responsible for the defense of Jinan Prefecture. He ordered the Marquis of Changchun Geng Bingwen to lead fifty thousand elite troops from the Beijing Camp to the area of Hebei to organize the troops of Zhending, Baoding, and Hejian Prefectures.
On the eighteenth day, Zhu Yunwen personally went to the Capital garrison, presiding over the training of the new army. Xu Huizu demonstrated a new battle formation for Zhu Yunwen, dividing them into blue and red teams, and trained the new army.
On the nineteenth day, Zhu Yunwen ordered Zheng Ci, the Minister of the Ministry of Works, to reorganize the ministry and strengthen military preparations. He also visited the Bureau of Military Works.
On the twentieth day, the Bureau of Military Works was transformed into the Bureau of Science and Technology, elevating the status and treatment of craftsmen. Those craftsmen who didn’t meet the standards would be converted into farmer households or army households, while the elite ones would be responsible for improving fire lances, cannons, and crossbows. Furthermore, outside the Jinchuan Gate, on Lion Mountain, the highest-level classified military base is established, responsible for the research and development of advanced explosives…
On the twenty-first day, the capital designated Jinan Prefecture as the logistics headquarters for the northern expedition under the pretext of countering Mongol threats. Grain and supplies from Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, and most of Hebei were transported to Jinan Prefecture to meet the needs of the northern expedition. Any insufficient portion would be supplied from the capital.
Zhu Yunwen’s series of actions made the court and the people inside and outside the court panic-stricken. Some individuals who couldn’t see the situation clearly accused Zhu Yunwen of conducting military training and grain transportation in winter, causing harm to the people and wasting resources. They were directly sent to the front lines for labor reform by Zhu Yunwen’s order.
Even if Grand Secretariat pleads, saying that censor officials should not be punished for their words, otherwise, opening up avenues for speech would become a joke.
But Zhu Yunwen did not think so. The censor officials don’t even have basic knowledge, yet they keep blabbering. Why shouldn’t they be punished?
What’s wrong with training troops in winter?
When war comes, do we differentiate between winter and summer?
They don’t know about the future Volunteer Army, fighting in minus 34-degree temperatures and wearing insufficient clothing! But they know that troops cannot be trained in the north in October?
Cannot transport grain?
Arrogant and ignorant!
“How can you say it’s punishment? I’m sending him to the front lines to understand the hardships of the army and the people. He can come back next spring.”
Zhu Yunwen cut off the pleas of the ministers.
On October 22nd, light snow fell in Nanjing.
Zhu Yunwen rarely had some free time, so he went to the Qianning Palace. After Empress Dowager finished her Buddhist rituals, he smiled at Dao Yan, who was about to leave, and said, “Master Dao Yan, please come to the Hall of Preserving Harmony.”
After bidding farewell to Empress Dowager, Zhu Yunwen arrived at the Hall of Preserving Harmony and looked at the thin old monk bowing before him, saying warmly, “Master, you have worked hard during this time.”
Dao Yan quickly replied, “I dare not. It is what this humble monk should do. The Empress Dowager devotes herself to Buddhism, and the Buddha will bestow blessings, protecting the Empress Dowager and Great Ming.”
“Haha, it’s not Gautama Buddha who protects Great Ming, but the countless people of Great Ming, including soldiers, merchants, and officials. If everyone relies on the Buddha for blessings, who does the world belong to, the Buddha or me?”
Zhu Yunchuan looked at Dao Yan and said seriously.
Dao Yan moved his prayer beads and said, “The Buddha is a thought in the mind, the essence of the spirit. Your Majesty is the ruler of the empire, the master of the people. These two are not contradictory.”
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly and asked, “So, as the master said, one side recites scriptures and practices diligently, serving the Buddha, performing good deeds during the day, while on the other side, one speaks harshly and wholeheartedly, delving into the realm of demons, committing evil deeds at night. These two aspects are not contradictory, right?”
A faint sound was heard as the thread of the prayer beads snapped. Beads scattered and rolled down, landing on the floor of the solemn hall, scattering in all directions.

Chapter 36: Dao Yan, let us compete whose Predictions Are More Accurate
Dao Yan lowered his head and looked at the beads, which scattered in different directions like startled rabbits, completely disordered and lacking any pattern. He spread out his old hands, and a black bead lay quietly in his palm.
“I don’t understand what Your Majesty is saying,” Dao Yan said, looking deeply at Zhu Yunwen.
Zhu Yunwen stood up and picked up a bead from the ground, twirling it between his fingers. He spoke, “For many years, the master has been advising the King of Yan on something, you are aware of it, and so am I. Emperor Taizu assigned you to serve the King of Yan to quell his murderous intent, but unexpectedly it has served your personal interests. I am well aware of the matter regarding the White Hat’s delivery to the vassal King.”
Dao Yan’s pupils slightly contracted, and his old face darkened.
“With your keen insight, Master, you are well aware of the consequences of Emperor Taizu’s actions in killing his meritorious ministers. You also know that among the Kings, only the King of Yan resembles Emperor Taizu in terms of methods, abilities, and potential. So, you chose the King of Yan, constantly persuading him to march south, am I right?”
Zhu Yunwen handed the bead to Dao Yan and asked.
Dao Yan opened his hands and received the bead. His gaze turned gray and he asked in return, “Is the person mentioned by Your Majesty referring to me?”
Zhu Yunwen burst into laughter, kicked one of the beads on the ground, and said sternly, “Dao Yan, or rather, Yao Guangxiao, I am not Gautama Buddha, and I cannot guide you to the Pure Land. But I am the ruler of the Great Ming, and I can send you to the depths of the imperial prison! I still allow you to live for now, but I fail to understand why you have been so determined to rebel. What is your purpose?”
Dao Yan was a peculiar individual. He incited Zhu Di to rebel, overthrowing one dynasty, and then assisted Zhu Di in establishing a new one. But what about himself?
He did not seek official positions, wealth, fame, or women.
During the day, he donned court attire, faithfully attending to his official duties. At night, he changed into a black kasaya, meditating quietly under a dim lamp, devoting himself wholeheartedly to Buddhism.
History books did not record his hobbies; they only documented the crimes he committed. No one knew his final wish before his death, and no one understood why he chose to rebel.
Zhu Yunwen was quite curious.
Dao Yan stood up, bowing respectfully, and said, “Your Majesty, I do not understand what you are saying.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at the pretending-to-be-oblivious Dao Yan, coldly sneered, sat back down, and said, “So be it. If you have concerns, I won’t force you. However, Dao Yan, since you claim to have the foresight and strategic acumen, let’s make a guess together about King of Yan’s next move, shall we?”
Dao Yan furrowed his brow, unsure of what Zhu Yunwen meant.
Zhu Yunwen pointed to the stack of documents on the table and said, “These are all the documents that have accumulated since you left Beiping Prefecture. You can review them here and then make your prediction about the King of Yan’s next actions. I will also make my prediction, and we shall see who is right and who is wrong.”
Dao Yan frowned. How could a monk be allowed to peruse official documents?
“If your prediction is correct, I will allow you to return to Beiping Prefecture. If you are wrong, you will stay and assist me in governing the Great Ming. How does that sound?”
Zhu Yunwen said earnestly.
Dao Yan’s eyes showed a hint of surprise.
Return to Beiping?
He(Zhu Yunwen) knew very well that he(Dao Yan) was Zhu Di’s confidant and even knew of his own rebellious intentions. Yet, Zhu Yunwen dared to let him go back?
Stay behind?
He dared to use him?
Dared to let him govern the Great Ming?
Dao Yan realized that he couldn’t see through the current Emperor Jianwen. Beneath his seemingly weak appearance, there seemed to be another soul, a powerful and confident soul.
“Since you’re not speaking, I’ll assume you’ve agreed. This is my prediction, which you can take with you. Seal your own prediction and one day, we will unseal them together to determine the winner.”
Zhu Yunwen placed the sealed letters on the table and then walked towards the door, instructing the palace guards not to disturb Dao Yan. If he needed to leave the palace, arrangements would be made to escort him out.
Shuangxi saw that Zhu Yunwen was in a good mood and smiled, saying, “Your Majesty, are you going to the harem today?”
Zhu Yunwen hadn’t visited the harem for over a month, and it was caused by the Single Whip Method. Despite the Grand Secretariat presenting a comprehensive plan to address the existing issues, they have also prepared response measures.
Such as the problem of the high price of silver and the low price of grain, the Grand Secretariat’s suggestion was to assign the Taxation Department with the responsibility of exchanging silver and grains, establishing a unified national standard to prevent merchants from maliciously driving up the price of silver.
Furthermore, for example, the issue of resistance from local governments was discussed repeatedly between the Grand Secretariat, the Ministry of Revenue, and Zhu Yunwen. They believed that the reason for the resistance from local governments was that the Single Whip Method would harm the interests of local officials, leaving them with no benefits.
The court could compromise and allocate thirty percent of the tax revenue to be autonomously managed by local governments, while the central government would retain the remaining seventy percent.
If Zhu Yuanzhang were in power, if he heard that they wanted to give his money to local governments, he would have hung the heads of the Grand Secretariat and the Ministry of Revenue on flagpoles and let them dry in the wind. But Zhu Yunwen was not Zhu Yuanzhang; he understood market principles better and understood the concepts of primary distribution and secondary distribution of finances.
Zhu Yunwen studied the historical tax revenue data provided by the Ministry of Revenue and calculated for a long time. In the end, he agreed with the Grand Secretariat’s proposal to benefit local governments and implemented the policy.
However, once Zhu Yunwen agreed, the Grand Secretariat nodded, and the Six Ministries became aware, the officials refused to cooperate.
Groups of officials started causing trouble, arguing that leaving money to local governments would inevitably lead to regional separatism and trigger corruption among local officials. They claimed that local areas would become prosperous while the central government would face financial shortages,
They also say that if such actions continue, the capital will inevitably fall into a state of food shortage, and the tragic scenes of cannibalism due to desperation will reoccur.
The Single Whip Method hadn’t even been implemented in local areas yet, but it faced resistance within the court.
This trouble make Zhu Yunwen headache, and he fully experienced the resistance to reforms. These conservatives, using lofty reason, criticized the whip system and found no value in it. Some officials even claimed that implementing such a system would incur divine wrath.
Whether divine wrath would come or not, Zhu Yunwen did not know.
But an earthquake did occur.
Although it was not severe and didn’t cause much damage, the tremors were felt.
This gave the officials even more room to maneuver, connecting the Single Whip Method with a warning from heaven, and they demanded that Zhu Yunwen abandon the policy.
Zhu Yunwen, usually good-natured, was infuriated.
Damn it, what’s with this earthquake? I know better than you idiots. To use an earthquake as an attack against the Single Whip Method… Then let’s give them a taste of the whip! Let these idiots take horsewhips and go to the border.
Within a month, Zhu Yunwen transferred thirty-five officials, For example, the most aggressively seventh-ranked Imperial Censor Liu Yong. Zhu Yunwen praised Liu Yong and then promoted him to the sixth-ranked Pacification Assistant Commissioner, stationed in Leizhou Prefecture.
Liu Yong, upon receiving the transfer order, begged the Emperor to revoke the appointment and changed his stance, claiming to be the first to support the Single Whip Method.
Leizhou Prefecture was the southernmost part of Guangzhou, after crossing the sea, one could go fishing on Hainan Island.
Liu Yong obviously had no hobby of fishing. He pleaded with his connections, used backdoor channels, and only when the Minister of Ministry of Personnel, Qi Tai interceded, did Zhu Yunwen revoke the appointment.
But others were not so lucky; they were the more stubborn ones. They packed their bags and went to the border if they were meant to herd horses, to the desert if they were meant to dig sand, and to the sea if they were meant to live a maritime life.
After all the commotion, Zhu Yunwen, the Grand Secretariat, and the Six Ministries reiterated their viewpoints multiple times, explaining the advantages of the Single Whip Method to the officials. Finally, they succeeded in convincing them.
Meanwhile, it had been over a month, and the delivery of autumn taxes had already begun in some regions.
With winter approaching, it was not suitable to implement the Single Whip Method.
In the end, the Grand Secretariat decided to inform local governments to temporarily postpone the delivery of autumn grain and prepare to implement the system in the first year of Jianwen. They also selected a group of students from the Imperial Academy to form a specialized team of officials responsible for overseeing the Single Whip Method.
Amidst all this commotion, Zhu Yunwen also had to address the issue of the New Military Policy.
As Jin Zhong had mentioned to Zhu Di, the biggest problem with the New Military Policy was whether it could be sustained. If the policy was abruptly halted midway and not continued, it would lead to serious issues.
Zhu Yunwen was not a reckless person, and the Five Army Commandery was not composed of fools. The officials in the Ministry of Revenue were particularly shrewd and would not overlook this point.
Based on the previous year’s tax revenues, although the central government’s treasury only held three million taels of silver, if grains were converted into silver, it would amount to over ten million taels.
With the New Military Policy, limited to areas such as the capital garrison, Beiping Prefecture, and Shanhai Pass, supporting it for one or two years was not a problem.
In addition, Zhu Yunwen was preparing for agricultural tax reforms and authorized a commercial reform in Beiping. The potential for commercial development was about to be unleashed. By then, the financial situation of Ming Dynasty would undoubtedly undergo a transformation. It wouldn’t be too late to implement the New Military Policy throughout the entire army.
Walking through the snow, Zhu Yunwen made his way to the harem.
He enjoyed the snow, the vast and pristine world.
The light snowflakes falling from the sky seemed like a fairy bestowed upon the world, attempting to change the world with their individual efforts.
Ma Enhui saw Zhu Yunwen coming through the snow and worriedly welcomed him into the room. She instructed someone to stoke the charcoal fire and asked a maid to prepare some hot soup. Then she complained, “Even though the snow is light, safety is paramount. On such a cold day, Your Majesty should stay in the warm hall. Why bother coming to Chang’an Palace?”
Zhu Yunwen hugged Zhu Wenkui as he rushed into his arms. Hearing the child call him “Father Emperor” in a tender voice, his heart warmed. He said to Ma Enhui, “If I hadn’t come, wouldn’t you have complained even more?”
“What would I complain about?” Ma Enhui glanced at Zhu Yunwen, took the clothes from the palace maid, walked to Zhu Yunwen, and said, “Change your clothes.”
Zhu Yunwen took the clothes but set them aside. He sighed, “No need to change. Sit down and talk with me.”
Ma Enhui held Zhu Wenkui in her arms, looked at the tired Zhu Yunwen, obediently sat down beside him, and asked with concern, “Your Majesty, the court affairs are numerous, but you must also balance work and rest.”
Zhu Yunwen nodded and said, “I just don’t understand. They are all well-educated scholars who understand right from wrong. Why do they oppose the Single Whip Method when they know it is right and beneficial for the country and the people? Why do they create obstacles for matters that are in the best interest of the nation and the people? Whom are they serving when they hold positions as officials?”
“Naturally, they serve Your Majesty,” Ma Enhui said softly.
Zhu Yunwen frowned slightly.
Seeing this, Ma Enhui hurriedly said, “Did I say something wrong, Your  Majesty?”
“No, you’re not wrong. I am the one who is wrong.”
Zhu Yunwen shook his head and said seriously, “You have awakened me. They are indeed serving me, but what I want is for them to serve the people and serve the Ming Dynasty! They Speculate on my intentions and engage in political opportunism, it would be better to take a stance that benefits the country and the people! These individuals have taken the wrong path. Ultimately, it reveals that there are issues with our education in the Ming Dynasty.”

Chapter 37: Cotton, Gauze, and the Central Bank
Confucius said, “Let the ruler be a ruler, the subject be a subject, the father be a father, and the son be a son.”
Mencius said, “There is affection between father and son, righteousness between ruler and subject, distinction between husband and wife, order between elder and younger, and trust between friends.”
Dong Zhongshu[1]Dong Zhongshu (Chinese: 董仲舒; Wade–Giles: Tung Chung-shu; 179–104 BC) was a Chinese philosopher, politician, and writer of the Han dynasty. He is traditionally associated … Continue reading inherited the views of Confucius and Mencius, and based on the theory of “respecting the yang and belittling the yin,” he put forward the Three Bonds and Five Constants.
This theory has strong vitality and has been passed down from generation to generation, gradually becoming a core element of Chinese culture and the spiritual pursuit of literati.
Whether it is Li He’s “To return the favor on the Golden Stage, I tote my Yulong Sword to die for him,” or Yue Fei’s “We have not yet avenged the shame of the Jingkang era, and the ministers’ hatred remains. When will it be extinguished?” or Xin Qiji’s “Nation’s matters of Emperor have to be done. That would earn fame before and after death.,” or Lu You’s “In my humble position, I dare not forget my concern for the country. When matters are settled, I still await the closing of my coffin,” they all reflect these ideas.
Loyalty to the ruler, respect for the ruler, and serving the ruler are the core values of traditional scholars!
As the emperor of the Great Ming Empire, Zhu Yunwen accepted this kind of thinking, but he did not expect that there would be a drawback behind it. When these officials were thinking, analyzing, and judging issues, their first thought was not whether the matter was right or good, but rather how the emperor perceived it.
If the emperor thought it was bad, they would oppose it, which was considered loyal.
If the emperor thought it was good, they would also oppose it, which was still considered loyal.
Only “loyalty” mattered.
Some people have been holding the Four Books and Five Classics for decades, which has given them nearsightedness. They speak of loyalty to the ruler at every turn, but when it comes to specific methods, they are at a loss.
Officials with rigid thinking and a lack of adaptability may not necessarily have any negative consequences, but they certainly won’t have any positive outcomes either.
Give them a prefecture or a county, and look at them ten years later. Alas, they are still the same, stagnating in place, which is heart-wrenching.
This is also one of the reasons why Zhu Yunwen wanted to Dao Yan stay behind. Although this guy was wicked, he had great insight, knew how to adapt, had a creative mind, and was talented in finding solutions in desperate situations. It was a waste to leave him to Zhu Di.
“What is this?”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Ma Enhui picking up a needle and thread, sewing winter clothes, and couldn’t help but ask.
Ma Enhui smiled and said, “The winter is getting cold. I plan to make a long coat for Your Majesty.”
Zhu Yunwen walked over, looked at the cotton inside the coat, and suddenly became stunned. He couldn’t help but ask, “Isn’t this cotton?”
Ma Enhui smiled and said, “Your Majesty rules the world, yet you have seen cotton?”
Zhu Yunwen took out a bit of cotton, looked at it carefully, and a pleased expression appeared on his face. He said to Ma Enhui, “Weren’t you worried about the livelihood of the Artistry troupe? Now, I have an idea.”
Ma Enhui took the cotton from Zhu Yunwen’s hand and said sarcastically, “Take it back, it won’t keep you warm. What idea? Making winter clothes? If the soldiers in the northern border lack winter clothes, I can mobilize the internal palace and sew them overnight.”
“The winter clothes for the soldiers have already been arranged. I’m talking about a big deal. However, we need to find an agent for this matter.”
Zhu Yunwen became excited.
“An agent?” Ma Enhui looked at Zhu Yunwen with confusion and asked, “What is an agent?”
Zhu Yunwen laughed and said, “It means finding someone to handle the matter. Although the King of Liao has been granted Songjiang prefecture, he has not yet taken up his fief. I think we can entrust this matter to him.”
Ma Enhui looked at the joyful Zhu Yunwen and put down her work. She asked eagerly, “Your Majesty hasn’t mentioned the good news yet. If it’s profitable, will you also take care of our family?”
Zhu Yunwen laughed and said, “Of course, we will take care of it. My dear, do you know that cotton is not only for keeping warm? If it is processed and turned into gauze, it becomes an excellent healing material. In the battlefield, apart from soldiers who sacrifice their lives, the largest number of casualties occurs in the field hospitals.”
“When soldiers are injured and their wounds cannot be healed in time, once infected, the wounds can fester and even lead to death. However, if we use this gauze with alcohol, we can reduce the chances of infection in soldiers’ wounds. With proper rest, they can recover. If I have a hundred thousand veteran soldiers in my hands, who in the world would dare not submit to the Great Ming?”
Ma Enhui looked at the spirited Zhu Yunwen with admiration in her eyes. Her husband was not a timid and weak scholar; he was an emperor with heroic qualities.
“If that’s the case, it will be a great matter benefiting the country and the people. Your Majesty, why not entrust it to the internal palace?” Ma Enhui stood up and saluted Zhu Yunwen, looking solemnly at him, saying, “I also want to contribute my efforts for the soldiers of the Great Ming.”
Zhu Yunwen helped Ma Enhui up and nodded slightly, saying, “The internal palace will be responsible for production, the King of Liao will be responsible for sales, the Ministry of War will be responsible for procurement, and we will be responsible for collecting money. How about that?”
Ma Enhui widened her eyes and for a moment, she couldn’t understand what he meant.
What does this mean?
Is the emperor planning to rob the treasury?
Zhu Yunwen smiled and said, “I plan to set up a Central Bank outside the Imperial Treasury.”
“Central Bank?”
Ma Enhui became even more confused.
Zhu Yunwen pulled Ma Enhui to sit down and patiently explained, “The current internal treasury is, in fact, the national treasury. The resources used in the imperial palace and by the state, all come from the internal treasury. I have the power to manage it, but I won’t use the funds of the internal treasury without authorization. But what about our future generations? They might not be able to do the same. If they misuse the internal treasury and deplete it, when the court faces a crisis and there’s no money left, wouldn’t it be a big problem?”
“Bringing the internal treasury under the national treasury is an inevitable matter. It’s just that the timing is not ripe yet. So, let’s take the first step and establish a Central Bank specifically responsible for managing the profits generated by the harem. First, we’ll see if the harem can sustain itself without relying on the national treasury and reduce the expenses from the national treasury. Second, if the country needs it, the Central Bank can also operate with funds, borrowing from the internal treasury and collecting interest, which won’t result in much loss.”
Ma Enhui finally understood. The emperor intended to merge the internal treasury with the national treasury and establish the Central Bank as the treasury of the imperial household, creating two separate sources.
The reason it hadn’t been explicitly mentioned yet was that their own source wasn’t fully established, and the funds were still insufficient.
“Your Majesty, I understand what you mean. But can we really make money from the gauze?”
Ma Enhui was uncertain.
Zhu Yunwen confidently smiled and said, “As long as the harem produces it, the Ministry of War will certainly purchase it. As for the price, it can be negotiated between the King of Liao and the Ministry of War. We will reap the benefits.”
Ma Enhui smiled and slowly said, “Your Majesty, is there another meaning behind this?”
“Oh?”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Ma Enhui.
Ma Enhui softly said, “The King of Liaodong, the King of Qin, the King of Jin, and the King of Min haven’t been granted their own fiefs. Now, Your Majesty is considering this way of generating wealth. Could it be that you don’t want them to establish their own fiefs?”
Zhu Yunwen’s eyes lit up, and he burst into laughter, exclaiming, “My dear, you’re so clever!”
The issue of the vassal kings was a major problem that Zhu Yunwen faced. Although the Kings of Liao, Qin, Jin, and Min had “voluntarily” relocated their fiefs, Zhu Yunwen didn’t want them to harm the local people. Besides, the Empress Dowager was fond of these children, so he didn’t allow them to establish their own fiefs.
But if they weren’t allowed to establish their own fiefs, they couldn’t remain idle, right?
Idleness often leads to trouble.
Therefore, from the beginning, Zhu Yunwen planned to break the prohibition set by Zhu Yuanzhang, allowing these vassal kings to engage in commerce and become wealthy, instead of exploiting the common people under their rule, wouldn’t it be more comfortable to earn money openly and honestly?
Although it would be more challenging, the achievements would be worth it.
Moreover, as vassal kings, they already had an advantage in commerce. State enterprises are not afraid of losses, as they have abundant channels for sourcing goods, and labor costs can be almost negligible. Plus, there’s no worry about sales…
Monopolizing the market, there’s no reason not to make money.
Cotton originated from India and Arab countries and was introduced to China during the Southern and Northern Dynasties. However, it was mostly cultivated in border regions.
During the Tang and Song dynasties, cotton fabric was referred to as “white folded cloth” or “cotton quilt.” Due to limited domestic production, it was considered a luxury item of that era, affordable only to the wealthy. 
The poem written by Du Fu, “Fine soft silk shoes, bright white cotton cap. Deeply hidden, used now for my own body,” bears witness to this.
These delicate and soft green silk shoes, the bright and clean white fine cotton cloth, these hidden items were originally intended for the high-ranking officials’ use, but now Lord Zan has presented them to me…
By the end of the Song Dynasty and the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty, cotton began to be extensively cultivated in the inner regions.
According to the “History of Yuan Dynasty,” in the 26th year of the Yuan Dynasty (1289), the government required the submission of 100,000 pieces of cotton fabric from Zhejiang, Jiangdong, Jiangxi, Huguang, and Fujian, indicating that the cotton industry had reached a considerable scale during the Yuan Dynasty and was concentrated in the Yangtze River Basin and southern China.
In the second year of the Yuanzhen era (1296), during the reign of Emperor Chengzong(Temur Khan) of the Yuan Dynasty, it was stipulated that “summer taxes shall be paid in the form of Cotton Tree, cloth, silk, cotton, and other materials.” Cotton was included in the government’s tax levies. Huang Daopo[2]Huang Daopo (simplified Chinese: 黄道婆; traditional Chinese: 黃道婆; pinyin: Huáng Dàopó; c. 1245 – 1330) rose from poverty to become one of the most famous women in … Continue reading, a renowned expert in textile innovation known to later generations, lived during the Yuan Dynasty.
During the period of Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang of the Ming Dynasty, he recognized the importance of cotton and implemented its cultivation forcefully. It was stipulated that any self-farming peasant with more than five mu of land must plant half a mu of cotton.
If they cultivated it well, they would be exempt from rent and taxes.
Benefiting from Zhu Yuanzhang’s measures, by the time of Emperor Zhu Yunwen, cotton production in the Ming Dynasty had become significant and gradually transitioned from a luxury item to a daily necessity for people of all social classes.
The tens of thousands of border troops could securely guard the northern region during winter, and one of the essential resources for them was cotton clothing, or more accurately, cotton armor.
Cotton armor was not only easy to produce, cost-effective, and warm, but it was also lightweight and provided decent protection against firearms, bows, and arrows.
After all, traditional heavy armor was too costly, and during the Ming Dynasty, there was a shortage of money but an abundance of cotton. As a result, cotton armor was used to replace some of the heavy armor. Later, the Qing army suffered significant losses in firearms and made cotton armor the mainstream equipment.
Zhu Yunwen planned to produce gauze, bandages, and alcohol to improve the medical care of the army.
Whether there would be a fight with Zhu Di in the future was still uncertain, but the battle with the Mongols was a known fact.
Regardless of the considerations, these things needed to be prepared early.
“Summon the King of Liao, King of Qin, King of Jin, and King of Min.”
Standing at the doorway, Zhu Yunwen looked at the falling snow and instructed Shuangxi.

Chapter 38: Defection, Capturing Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng
Eleventh month of Beiping Prefecture, the bitterly cold northern wind blew, freezing both the sky and the earth.
The flags above the tent of the King of Yan’s Three Guards Camp fluttered with a crisp sound. Several ice daggers of varying lengths hung along the edges of the camp. On the training ground, only a few withered white poplar trees and a few piles of residual snow remained. Hardly any soldiers could be seen.
As the night deepened, the silence in the main camp grew more profound.
A few figures glanced around, seeing no one in sight. They cautiously emerged from their tents and made their way to a specific tent, carefully lifting the heavy curtain and slipping inside.
Inside the tent, there were already three people sitting around a warm brazier, silent and still.
One after another, more than twenty people entered the tent, dispersing throughout and remaining silent.
“Company Commander, everyone has arrived.”
In the dim light, someone spoke up.
Company Comamnder Ni Qiong rubbed his hands together, glanced around, and lowered his voice, saying, “I believe you all know the situation. The court has set a deadline for the implementation of the new military policy until the last day of November. If we miss this opportunity, we’ll have to wait another ten years. If any of you have anything to say, please speak up.”
“Commander Ni, we will follow your lead.”
“Yes, we’ll follow your lead.”
Inside the tent, voices echoed in a low and uneven manner, uttering similar words.
Ni Qiong warmed his hands by the fire and sighed, “Brothers, I don’t mind telling you that I have brothers serving in the Provincial Military office. They have informed me that the implementation of the new military policy has been highly effective, despite some difficulties. We need to be patient and wait. Now, the Family Affairs Department has been connected to the Beiping Administration Commission. Once the Commission receives any cases related to soldiers’ families, they will transfer them all to the Family Affairs Department, which will handle and coordinate the matters.”
“About half a month ago, you must have heard about the incident at Wang’s Manor outside the city. The son of that farmer who was beaten is a soldier under the Provincial Military office. When the Family Affairs Department received the news, the Provincial Military office personally took action. Not only did they make the landlord compensate the farmer with ten taels of silver, but they also publicly apologized to the farmer and promised to never harm him again.”
“There were many witnesses to this event. I have heard that in the past two months, the Family Affairs Department has resolved over three hundred cases. We can all see whether they can handle the matter or not. As for the imperial funds, the Provincial Military office has released detailed regulations. For minor illnesses like colds, the imperial funds won’t be used. However, if the accumulated expenses exceed three taels of silver, you can submit a report to the Provincial Military office for reimbursement.”
“As long as you provide a prescription from a physician and the payment receipts, the Provincial Military office will immediately reimburse half of the expenses. Liu’s father was seriously ill and bedridden. He passed away a few days ago. When Liu brought the account from Changchun Hall, the Provincial Military office didn’t hesitate to give him twelve taels of imperial funds. Remember, this account covers expenses from the past five years, not just after the new military policy came into effect.”
“Brothers, I, Ni Qiong, may not be talented, and I may not understand profound principles, but I do know that the new military policy implemented by the Emperor is for our own good. Now, there are only ten days left until the end of the new military policy. If we miss this chance, we’ll have to wait another ten years!”
“Ten years! Who knows, within these ten years, some of us might already be dead! I still have parents, a wife, and children. Even if I die, I want to leave something behind for them. My mind is made up. I will pledge my allegiance to Commander Ping An. If you consider me your brother, please don’t hinder me. If you don’t see me as your brother and choose to report this to the Yan Prince directly, I, Ni Qiong, won’t hold it against you!”
Ni Qiong’s words rendered everyone in the tent silent.
Initially, they had believed in Zhu Di, believed that the new military policy wouldn’t last. However, one month, two months had passed, and there was no sign of the strategy weakening. Instead, it overcame obstacles one after another and achieved significant success.
There were stories of some veteran soldiers wanting to retire and return home.
Ping An arranged their retirement, organizing a grand farewell ceremony with a high-standard military send-off. The sight of this moved the veterans to tears, and they vowed that if there were ever a war, they would immediately return to the military camp upon a single call.
The new military policy had resolved many seemingly impossible problems, and it seemed as if the imperial funds were inexhaustible. Whether it was the imperial funds, the Family Affairs Department, or military resources and retirement fees, not a single person had experienced any shortage.
These stories had spread among everyone.
After all, no matter how intense the training was, Zhu Di couldn’t possibly keep everyone inside the camp for two months. Besides, Ping’an represented the emperor and occasionally brought things to visit the King of Yan’s Three Guards. Naturally, the people accompanying him would naturally discuss the policy of the new military.
The end of November was the deadline for the new military policy. If they missed it, they would have to wait another ten years. This was what Ping’an personally said when visiting the Three Guards, and he explained the reasons behind it: once the logistics supply line was established, making adjustments would consume a lot of resources and affect the overall situation.
Advised the Three Guards, if they didn’t join the new military policy before the deadline, all the supplies originally prepared for them would be sent to Great Ning. In the next ten years, this supply line would belong to Great Ning.
Naturally, this news caused panic among the Three Guards.
Taking advantage of the fluctuation in morale, the personnel from the Great Ming Security Bureau took action and thoroughly investigated the background of the hundred households in the Three Guards, selecting those with elderly and young family members and a relatively short period of following Zhu Di as targets for defection.
One of them was Company Commander Ni Qiong.
“Company Commander, we’ll go with you!”
Someone stood up, their voice slightly hoarse.
“I’ll go with you too!”
“I’m going too!”
“We’re going too!”
Everyone in the tent stood up.
Ni Qiong stood up, satisfied, and said solemnly, “In that case, we will all go to join the Commander of Provincial Military office and join the Beiping Guards, serving for the glory of the Great Ming!”
“Good!”
They all agreed and dispersed quietly.
King of Yan’s mansion.
Zhu Di had been feeling a bit irritable recently, with blisters forming at the corners of his mouth.
Zhu Yunwen appointed Tie Xuan as the Commander of Jinan Garrison and ordered Geng Bingwen, the Marquis of Changchun, to lead 50,000 elite troops to the region of Hebei to reorganize the soldiers of Zhending, Baoding, and Hejian Prefectures.
Zhu Di was well aware of this news, and whether it was Zhending, Baoding, or Hejian, these three important towns, as well as Jinan, both by land and by water, were obstacles to his southward march.
What was even more infuriating was that Zhu Yunwen had designated Jinan Garrison as the logistical base of the northern expedition, demanding that the reserves and supplies be stored in Jinan. This meant that in the future, Beiping prefecture would no longer have a large number of military provisions.
Once he initiated the rebellion, the small amount of food in Beiping would be completely insufficient to sustain the army’s rations for three months. If Jinan couldn’t be captured within three months, they would face a situation without food!
Although Jinan was under the command of the relatively unknown Tie Xuan, Geng Bingwen in Zhending, Baoding, and Hejian was not ordinary figure.
Marquis Changchun, Geng Bingwen, was an extremely skilled defender. During the battle between Zhu Yuanzhang and Zhang Shicheng, Geng Bingwen held his position in Changxing, defending it for ten years and leaving Zhang Shicheng helpless and frustrated.
Zhu Di didn’t have the confidence to capture the three prefectures under Geng Bingwen’s control!
And what troubled Zhu Di the most was the new military policy. He could spread anti-propaganda, and brainwash people, but Ping’an could also spread propaganda. Moreover, this guy carried the title of inspecting the Three Guards on behalf of the “emperor,” and no one could stop him from entering the camp of the Three Guards.
While the new military policy flourished like fire, Zhu Di felt as if he had fallen into an ice cave.
The situation was changing day by day, and the morale of the army became increasingly unstable. If this continued, it wouldn’t take two years, but just six months, for the army’s morale to collapse.
“Something’s wrong, something’s wrong!”
Qiu Fu shouted in a flustered manner.
Zhu Di furrowed his brow and looked at the unruly Qiu Fu, coldly saying, “What’s the matter? Don’t make a fuss!”
Qiu Fu’s face turned pale, his hands trembling as he said to Zhu Di, “Over five hundred people from the Three Guards have left the camp and defected to the Provincial Military office. Ping’an has incorporated them into the Beiping Garrison, and among them are three Company Commander.”
“What?”
Zhu Di stood up abruptly, feeling the world spinning around him. His vision darkened, and he collapsed.
“Your Highness, Your Highness!”
Qiu Fu shouted loudly.
Chaos erupted in the King of Yan’s mansion. After the physician’s diagnosis, they concluded that it was fainting caused by excessive worries and anxiety, and Zhu Di only needed to rest for a period of time.
Consort Xu Yihua personally took care of Zhu Di. Seeing Zhu Gaochi, Zhu Gaoxu, Zhang Yu, Zhu Neng, and others anxiously pacing inside the room, she asked them to wait outside.
Zhu Gaoxu stood at the door, his face icy, and gritting his teeth, saying, “These bastards! He treated them so well in the past, yet they turn against him at a time like this! If we don’t kill them, it won’t be enough to shake the army’s morale!”
Zhu Gaochi shook his head and refuted, “How can we kill them? They are no longer our people but Ping’an’s people! Besides, there are over five hundred of them. Can you kill them all?”
“If we don’t kill them, the entire Three Guards will desert!”
Zhu Gaoxu shouted in frustration.
Zhu Gaochi understood the problem, but killing might not solve it. On the contrary, it would cause panic among the Third Guard and accelerate their alignment with Ping’an.
“Mr. Jin, what should we do in the current situation?”
Zhu Gaozhi asked Jin Zhong for advice.
Jin Zhong sighed and said with a bitter tone, “It will be difficult to restore the morale of the Three Guards. For the current plan, we should immediately block off the Three Guard camp. Once the deadline for the new military policy passes, the situation may improve.”
“Blocking the camp is easy, but if Ping’an uses the emperor’s order to forcefully enter the Three Guard camp, what should we do?”
Zhu Gaochi frowned.
Jin Zhong pondered for a while and slowly said, “Then, in front of Ping’an, conduct training for the new troops without breaks and without giving Ping’an the opportunity to speak.”
Zhu Gaochi glanced at Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng. The two of them hurriedly saluted, then quickly left the Yan Prince’s Residence.
Beiping, Provincial Military office.
Ni Qiong and over five hundred people submitted a letter of allegiance, confessing their involvement in inciting rebellion and hostility towards the court, all under the influence of Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng.
Ping’an and Sheng Yong urgently summoned Zhang Bing, and the three of them discussed countermeasures.
After long contemplation, Zhang Bing said, “This matter is of great importance. If mishandled, it will lead to a major war. It’s best to send a report to the capital and let the emperor decide.”
Sheng Yong spread out a map of the mountains and rivers and said solemnly, ” Even if it’s an urgent matter of 800 miles., it will take ten days for it to go back and forth. And within these ten days, once our information leaks, the King of Yan will take action. By that time, it will be too late for us to make a move.”
Zhang Bing hesitated and said, “That’s true, but Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng are still the most powerful generals under the King of Yan’s command. They have high prestige in the army. Once we arrest them, how can we ensure that the situation won’t deteriorate rapidly? Moreover, without the emperor’s decree, if any mistakes occur, who will take responsibility? Who can bear it?”
Ping’an looked at the ongoing debate between Zhang Bing and Sheng Yong, then knocked on the table and said solemnly, “I will take responsibility for capturing Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng. To prevent chaos in the Three Guards, Sheng Yong, you will strictly control Beiping Prefecture. I will personally go and capture them!”

Chapter 39: Zhu Di Has Gone Mad
Decisive and swift, it is Ping An’s style.
After receiving the testimonies of Ni Qiong and others, Ping’an mobilized 30,000 elite soldiers from the Beiping Guards in less than three hours. With thunderous momentum, they surrounded the Three Guards of King of Yan and personally entered the camp, capturing Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng, who were in the midst of a lecture.
The personal guards of Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng wanted to intervene, but Ping’an roared like thunder, “Anyone who dares to act will be considered an accomplice of the rebels and his three-generation will be exterminated!”
The crime of rebellion is not something anyone can bear.
It’s one thing if you’re not married, dying for loyalty only affects yourself and doesn’t implicate others. But for those who have a family, who would sacrifice their whole family for the sake of loyalty?
In addition to Ping An’s men, who were tall and strong with excellent weapons and thorough preparations, the unprepared Three Guards of King of Yan would be like lambs waiting to be slaughtered once the battle started.
Ping An cleaved the table with a sword and shouted, “Listen to me clearly! The Emperor has devoted all his efforts and worked tirelessly day and night for the New Military Policy! Whoever dares to betray the Emperor or defy the court, don’t blame me, Ping’an, for being impolite! Even if the God himself came, he would have to ask whether my sword and my brothers would agree or not!”
Tens of thousands of elite troops, clad in bright armor and wielding sharp weapons, high in morale, left the camp of the Three Guards. Throughout the entire process, there was no noise, no chaos.
Orderly and silent.
But also powerful!
The capture of Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng left Zhu Gaochi, Zhu Gaoxu, and others in the King of Yan’s mansion in a panic. Jin Zhong also did not expect things to escalate to this point and was momentarily at a loss.
Under Zhu Di’s command, there were many formidable military commanders such as Qiu Fu, Tan Yuan, Liu Sheng, Zhang Yu, Zhu Neng, Guan Tong, and Lu Zhen. But in terms of commanding ability, Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng were considered the strongest.
Now that Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng had been captured, it meant that the Three Guards had lost their strongest commanding generals. Even more seriously, the loyalty of the Three Guards of the King of Yan was wavering, on the verge of disintegration. The fact that more than five hundred people defected from the Three Guards and joined the Provincial Military Office was evidence of this.
“Come in, the King has awakened.”
Xu Yihua frowned, opened the door, and said to the undecided group of people.
Everyone hurried into the room, and Zhu Gaochi informed Zhu Di of Ping An’s capture of Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng. Zhu Di leaned back on the bed, with deep-set eye sockets and exhaustion, and sighed, “What do you all think?”
“Father, we can’t wait any longer. We must act immediately!” Zhu Gaoxu quickly spoke, expressing his opinion,
“The court is pressing us step by step, and their intentions to weaken the vassals are already clear. We can’t just sit idly by and let the butcher’s knife fall. We should seize this opportunity to rescue Generals Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng, mobilize the Three Guards, and take control of Beiping Prefecture!”
Zhu Di’s gaze revealed hidden worries as he looked at Zhu Gaochi and asked, “What about you? What’s your opinion?”
Zhu Gaochi sighed and wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, saying, “Father, things have come to this point, and the best course of action for us now is to incorporate the New Military Policy into the three guards.”
“Big brother, you’re confused!” Zhu Gaoxu couldn’t believe his ears and questioned, “If we could incorporate the New Military Policy, why would we have to wait until now?”
Zhu Gaochi ignored Zhu Gaoxu and looked at Zhu Di, saying seriously, “I have analyzed the court’s strategy and reviewed all the arrangements they made around Beiping Prefecture. I have only found one problem.”
“What problem?” Zhu Di asked.
Zhu Gaochi said earnestly, “The Emperor knows that we want to rebel, but he doesn’t want us to rebel.”
Yuan Rong sneered beside them and said, “What do you mean by ‘knowing that we want to rebel’? If the court knew, we would have been demoted to commoners or imprisoned in the capital. How could we still be here in peace? And what does it mean that he doesn’t want us to rebel? Does the Emperor want to win us over using his benevolence? Wants us to be loyal to the court?”
“You shut up!” Zhu Di coldly shouted.
Yuan Rong’s face turned ugly, but he didn’t dare to speak again.
Zhu Di closed his eyes and asked, “Jin Zhong, what do you think?”
Jin Zhong took a step forward, his brows furrowed with concern and said, “If the New Military Policy doesn’t enter the Three Guards, we will have no more opportunities. But once the New Military Policy enters the three guards, our chances will be extremely slim.”
“Why don’t we just take control of Beiping Prefecture now? That would solve all the problems,” Zhu Gaoxu grumbled dissatisfiedly.
Jin Zhong looked at Zhu Gaoxu respectfully and said, “Prince, Ping An and Sheng Yong are already prepared for this. In this situation, it may not be possible to control Beiping Prefecture through the Three Guards. Even if we control Beiping Prefecture, where can we go? Let’s not forget, there are four hundred thousand troops surrounding Beiping Prefecture.”
“To the south, there’s Geng Bingwen defending Zhending, Baoding, and Hejian. To the east, there’s Qu Neng and Xu Kai controlling Shanhai Pass, Kaiping, and Linqing. To the west, there’s the Marquis of Wuding, Guo Ying controlling Datong. And to the north, it’s an uninhabited wasteland. With the current morale and fighting power of the Three Guards, we have no certainty no matter which direction we choose.”
“For now, the only plan is to accept the New Military Policy and plan for the future. It’s a necessary measure, and the only way to restore the morale of the Three Guards.”
Jin Zhong’s words displeased Zhu Gaoxu, who felt that Jin Zhong was undermining others’ ambitions and diminishing his own prestige. He turned to Zhu Di and said, “Father, with just ten thousand soldiers, I can take control of Beiping City.”
Zhu Di waved his hand and looked at Zhu Gaochi, saying, “You’re right. The Emperor is not forcing me, Zhu Di, to rebel, but forcing me not to rebel! Whether it’s the layout of Beiping, the layout of Shanhai Pass, Datong, Jinan, Zhending, and other places, or even the relocation of Dao Yan to the capital, the Emperor’s actions are all about ‘power’!”
“Therefore, those skilled in warfare seek their victories from the power dynamics, not blaming others but adapting to the situation. Those who adapt to the situation are the true warriors, like turning wood and stone. The nature of wood and stone is to be calm when safe, to move when in danger, to stop when square, and to move when round. Thus, the skilled warrior’s power is like rolling a circular stone down a thousand-ren mountain, it’s all about power. Hehe, this nephew of mine is quite good.”
Zhu Gaochi lowered his head, gritted his teeth, and asked, “Father, what should we do?”
Zhu Di sighed and wearily said, “Forget it, let’s incorporate the New Military Policy into the Three Guards and wait for an opportunity. If the heavens favor us, there will be a turning point.”
“Your Highness, Ping An requests an audience.”
Qiu Fu reported in a low voice.
Zhu Di’s face turned cold, and Zhu Gaoxu and the others became somewhat panicked. Ping An captured Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng, and now he came to the King of Yan’s mansion. What was his intention? Could it be that he had received an imperial edict and wanted to bring the King of Yan and his followers to the capital?
“There are no guards.”
Qiu Fu added.
Zhu Di’s gaze turned sinister, and he got up from the bed.
Xu Yihua quickly supported him, but Zhu Di shook his head and said, “It’s fine. If I can’t withstand these minor disturbances, how can I gallop across the desert? Let Ping An come.”
Main Hall.
Ping An bowed to Zhu Di and expressed his apologies, saying, “Today, I received intelligence that Zhang Yu and Zhu Neng incited the soldiers to resist the court and intended to rebel. The situation is urgent, and the Pronvincial Military office couldn’t ask for instructions from King of Yan in time. I have captured Zhang and Zhu, and I hope King of Yan understands.”
Zhu Di’s face turned cold, and he swept the teacup off the table with a wave of his sleeve, saying sternly, “Understand? Although Zhang Yu was a defector from the Yuan Dynasty, he pledged allegiance to our Great Ming and made great contributions. He earned great fame in the Battle of the Buir Lake and participated in campaigns led by Lan Yu to suppress rebellion in Yuanshun and Sanmao territories. He was highly regarded by Taizu and held the position of Assistant Commissioner of Anqing Garrison.”
“After following me, he fought on the frontier, displaying bravery and tactical acumen, repeatedly achieving meritorious deeds. Such a loyal and courageous person, and yet you claim he has intentions of rebellion? As for Zhu Neng, he was originally a vice battalion commander in my Yan Mountain Garrison. Recognizing his loyalty and capability, I promoted him to the position of Assistant Commisioner of the Right Guard. He has been following me for many years. As for his character, am I not aware of it?”
“Don’t talk about inciting the soldiers to resist the court. He hasn’t even uttered a disloyal word to the court. Where is the rebellion? Ping An, if you can’t provide the evidence, don’t blame me for reporting to the capital and accusing you of negligence, allowing troops to run amok, and slandering!”
Ping An looked at the furious Zhu Di calmly and took out a stack of papers, placing them on the table, and said softly, “Here are a hundred confessions from the soldiers of the Three Guards. The Provincial Military office has over four hundred more. If King of Yan needs them, I don’t mind making another trip. We just hope that King of Yan takes care of yourself.”
After speaking, Ping An saluted and walked out.
Zhu Di’s expression changed unpredictably as he picked up the stack of confessions and looked at the testimonies. Suddenly, a loud roar echoed in his ears, and his vision went black as he fainted once again.
Ping An heard the commotion but didn’t look back. He left King of Yan’s mansion and headed straight to the Provincial Military office, ordering strict martial law in Beiping Prefecture. Without the commanding officer’s orders, no military forces were allowed to move without permission. He ordered Sheng Yong to lead thirty thousand soldiers to closely monitor the Three Guards of King of Yan. If there were any unusual movements, they didn’t need to seek instructions but could take direct action.
Sitting in the Provincial Military office was not only Ping’an but also Zhang Bing.
Zhang Bing was very worried about Ping An’s way of doing things and reminded, “Without permission from the court, never use the main forces, and never besiege the King of Yan’s mansion.”
Ping An knew that Zhang Bing had good intentions, but taking action against King of Yan without seeking an imperial edict was an act of usurping military power and acting recklessly. It was a disregard and provocation to the dignity of the royal family!
The consequences can also be anticipated.
Although Zhu Yunwen had given Zhang Bing, Ping An, and Sheng Yong considerable power and even entrusted them with the task of taking preemptive action if King of Yan showed any signs of defiance, the entrusted task was one thing, but without clear imperial edict, if any problems arose, who would bear the blame?
Ping An understood this reasoning, but he also understood that dealing with formidable individuals like Zhu Di meant either not taking any action at all or directly striking them down. If they dragged it out, the one who would end up dead would be themselves.
“I will send a memorial to the court.”
Ping An understood that the current situation was complex. After finishing the memorial, he was about to urgently send it out over the 800-mile journey. However, Sheng Yong rushed in anxiously, his face filled with uncertainty, and exclaimed, “Something bad has happened!”
“Could it be that the King of Yan has really made a move?!” Ping An’s face turned solemn, and he immediately prepared for battle.
Sheng Yong gasped for breath and, looking at the slightly panicked Zhang Bing and the composed and stern Ping An, quickly said, “King of Yan, King of Yan, he’s gone mad!”
“Gone mad?”
Zhang Bing looked puzzled.
Ping An widened his eyes, somewhat astonished. Shouldn’t it be said that King of Yan had rebelled?
Why was it said that King of Yan had gone mad?
Sheng Yong took a sip of cold tea, shivered, and then looked at Ping An seriously, saying, “We just received news that King of Yan Zhu Di, has gone mad!”

Chapter 40: Predicted your Prediction
The cold wind blew through the remnants of snow, freezing the recently splashed water into frost.
A disheveled middle-aged man, dressed in thin clothing, ran through the streets, shouting at the top of his lungs, “I’m dying of heat!”
Zhu Di snatched a live fish from a stall and took a bite, laughing heartily. He then ran to a bridge and jumped straight into the frozen river, splashing around and continuously drinking the river water, exclaiming, “Refreshing!”
The officials and citizens of Beiping watched in astonishment and disbelief.
Zhu Gaochi, Zhu Gaoxu, Zhu Gaosui, and others finally managed to pull Zhu Di out of the river, but Zhu Di, as if not recognizing them, began wildly punching and kicking Zhu Gaoxu back into the water. He laughed loudly by the riverbank and ran along the river, drenched from head to toe…
Many people witnessed this.
Whether they believed it or not, Zhu Di had gone mad by the river.
Once a mighty and invincible commander, he had become a lamentable madman.
Ping An took off his fur coat, walked briskly into the inner hall of the Provincial Military office, and sat by the fire, warming his hands. He said to Sheng Yong and Zhang Bing, “People from the King of Yan’s mansion say that after Zhu Di read the confessions of Ni Qiong and others, he fainted and woke up insane.”
“Insane? Haha, I don’t believe it,” Sheng Yong replied decisively.
Zhang Bing was uncertain and said, “In such a bitterly cold winter, unable to survive in thin clothing, the King of Yan actually believes it’s incredibly hot and repeatedly jumps into icy rivers to cool down. If that’s not madness, then what is it?”
Sheng Yong looked at the fire, chuckled, and said, “General of Hundreds Battle, how could he be driven mad by a few accusations? Commissioner Zhang, may I ask, if His Majesty ordered your execution, would you go mad?”
Zhang Bing pondered for a moment and finally shook his head, saying, “No, but nothing is certain…”
Ping An narrowed his eyes, rubbed his hands together, and said, “There’s no uncertainty. The King of Yan is pretending to be insane.”
Zhang Bing looked at Ping An in surprise and asked, “How can you be so sure?”
Ping An chuckled, opened his collar, and took out a confidential letter from his closest clothing. He handed it to Zhang Bing and said solemnly, “I, Ping An, don’t believe in gods, nor do I believe in anyone’s ability to predict the future. But now, I believe. Our Emperor, with his genius intellect, foresaw the current situation!”
“What?”
Zhang Bing, puzzled, opened the envelope and glanced at the contents of the letter. He immediately stood up in astonishment, trembling, and looked at Ping An, asking, “This, this can’t be true, can it?!”
“Let me see.”
Sheng Yong quickly snatched the letter and, after reading it, widened his eyes, staring at Ping An and asking, “What is going on?”
Ping An gazed at the orange fire, the charcoal inside already turning slightly white.
Over a month ago, agents from the Great Ming Security Bureau arrived in Beiping, delivering this confidential letter to Ping An and informing him of Zhu Yunwen’s intentions.
Following Zhu Yunwen’s instructions, Ping An created an opportunity for the agents of the Great Ming Security Bureau to enter the King of Yan’s Three Guard Camp, conduct investigations, and secretly instigate defections.
The betrayal of Ni Qiong and others from the Three Guards was the result of the efforts of the Great Ming Security Bureau.
In this confidential letter, Zhu Yunwen’s assessment of the situation in Beiping was clearly recorded, with one sentence in particular:
“[Under the condition of defection, the conspiracy will be exposed. The King of Yan, in order to avoid disaster, will act insane to garner sympathy and wait for the right moment…]”
The letter was dated October 16th!
And the current date was November 21st!
In other words, over a month ago, Zhu Yunwen, who was far away in the capital, had foreseen the situation in Beiping and predicted Zhu Di’s every move!
What a terrifying ability!
Zhang Bing and Sheng Yong found it hard to believe everything. It was even more shocking than Zhu Di going mad!
Especially the choice of words used by Zhu Yunwen, “will act insane” instead of “might act insane,” indicated that Zhu Yunwen had complete certainty.
When Ping An first saw those words, he dismissed them with a smile:
How could Zhu Di, who had killed countless people, possibly go mad?
His Majesty’s words were too exaggerated and unrealistic.
But now, Ping An, like Zhang Bing and Sheng Yong, was unable to extricate himself from the shock.
Great Ning Prefecture, King of Ning’s Residence.
Zhu Quan was reading in his study. There weren’t many military affairs during the winter season.
The Mongols were also human beings; they knew it was cold and wouldn’t come to cause trouble at this time. Most likely, they were enjoying themselves in their Mongolian tents.
Moreover, the current Mongols didn’t dare to launch large-scale attacks on the Ming Dynasty.
In the 21st year of the Hongwu era (1388), General Lan Yu led a 150,000-strong army on a northern expedition, passing through Great Ning and reaching Qingzhou. They essentially annihilated the Northern Yuan Dynasty at Buir Lake.
The political enemies of the Ming Dynasty disappeared ten years ago.
The Mongol power today is no longer that of a specific regime but rather a scattered and independent force. They lack the courage and strength to launch a large-scale invasion of the Ming Dynasty’s border.
Commander Fang Kuan was patrolling the city when he suddenly saw a cavalryman rushing into the city with a report. He quickly ordered his men to intercept and inquire. After learning the news, his face changed drastically, and he hurriedly took the urgent report and rushed to the King of Ning’s Residence.
“Your Highness, urgent report!”
Fang Kuan hurriedly pushed open the door, and the cold wind swept into the room.
Zhu Quan furrowed his brow and said in a deep voice, “Where is the urgent report from?”
“It’s from Beiping Prefecture.”
Fang Kuan’s lips were slightly chapped.
Zhu Quan was somewhat surprised. He looked up at Fang Kuan, took the urgent report, and asked, “How did Beiping Prefecture’s urgent report end up in my Great Ning Prefecture?”
“My lord, please look at the emblem on the urgent report,” Fang Kuan reminded him.
Zhu Quan lowered his head and examined the urgent report closely. On it was engraved a unique emblem—a diagonal cross formed by intersecting swords, resembling the letter “X.” He couldn’t help but gasp in astonishment. Zhu Quan was well aware of this peculiar emblem. It was the distinct symbol of the Great Ming Security Bureau, personally designated by Zhu Yunwen himself. Its meaning was clear: always in battle.
Why would the Great Ming Security Bureau send him an urgent report?
Zhu Quan quickly opened the urgent report and read its contents. Instantly, he stood up and hurriedly asked, “Where is the courier? Summon him immediately!”
Fang Kuan shouted outside the door, and a courier with lips turning blue from the cold entered the room, bowing respectfully. “Greetings, King of Ning.”
Zhu Quan glanced at the letter and incredulously asked the courier, “Fourth Brother, has the King of Yan gone mad?”
“The people of Beiping say so, witnessing countless incidents. However, there is no definitive conclusion on whether he is truly mad.”
The courier replied cautiously.
Zhu Quan recalled his discussion with Zhu Yunwen before leaving the capital, where they analyzed the situation in Beiping in detail. Now, it seemed that everything Zhu Yunwen predicted had come true.
The King of Yan had gone mad.
It was feigned madness.
Zhu Quan knew that Zhu Yunwen was aware of Zhu Di’s pretense of madness and had anticipated it. However, Zhu Di remained oblivious and continued to fervently perform his act of madness.
Deep within his heart, Zhu Quan felt a profound sense of sorrow for Zhu Di. He was also greatly amazed by Zhu Yunwen’s genius foresight.
It seemed that Zhu Yunwen had scripted this play long ago, selecting the roles, setting the stage, and then calling out, “Zhu Di, please begin your performance.” Zhu Di remained completely unaware, following the script step by step, ultimately reaching the most spectacular scene:
Feigning madness.
Zhu Quan could imagine that Zhu Yunwen must be laughing heartily in the capital, while Zhu Di could only delude himself into thinking he had succeeded, wholeheartedly performing a role that would never achieve its intended purpose.
“The Emperor is right!”
Zhu Quan slumped in his chair, feeling as though the room had grown even colder, causing him to shiver involuntarily.
Zhu Yunwen foresaw everything but took no action. Instead, he continuously provided chances to Zhu Di, his fourth brother!
Zhu Quan understood that according to Zhu Yunwen’s subsequent predictions, Zhu Di would wait for the right moment, dispatch his men or come personally to Daning, seize his Duoyan Three Guards, counterattack Beiping, and establish it as a stronghold to challenge the court!
“No, I cannot allow such a thing to happen!”
Zhu Quan realized that if things continued to unfold, he would undoubtedly meet his demise.
Facing an emperor who controlled the entire Great Ming Empire and possessed extraordinary predictive abilities, there was no chance of victory.
Moreover, Zhu Quan was well aware of the New Military Policy. Currently, the guards in the capital and Beiping had all pledged their loyalty to the court. Once chaos erupted in Beiping, those soldiers would fight to the death.
The soldiers of the various guards armed under the New Military policy are a fearless army, knowing death yet unafraid of it. They are a determined army with willpower as strong as the Great Wall, a military force willing to die for their country and unyielding even in the face of death!
Zhu Quan had no confidence in defeating such an army, even with his most formidable cavalry, the Duoyan Three Guards!
“Summon Mao Zheng and He Yunzhong to see me!” After much contemplation, Zhu Quan instructed Fang Kuan.
Mao Zheng and He Yunzhong soon arrived at the King of Ning’s residence. After sealing the prepared envelope, Zhu Quan handed it to Mao Zheng and said to both of them, “You two were once followers of the King of Yan. Now I need you two to depart immediately and deliver this letter to the King of Yan in person as quickly as possible. Then return to Daning prefecture without delay. Do not utter a single unnecessary word or ask any unnecessary questions. Do you understand?”
He Yunzhong glanced at Mao Zheng, and although they didn’t fully comprehend the situation, they solemnly agreed. Seeing that Zhu Quan had no further instructions, they concealed the letter and hastily left the King of Ning’s residence, making their way directly to Songting Pass.
Zhu Quan didn’t wish to witness a battle between family.
On November 27th, in the Imperial Palace of the capital, in the Hall of Preserving Harmony.
Zhu Yunwen looked at Dao Yan, who was in deep meditation, continuously twirling his prayer beads. Zhu Yunwen took out an urgent report that had traveled 800 miles and said, “This urgent report is from Beiping Prefecture.”
Dao Yan opened his eyes, his gaze fixed on Zhu Yunwen, and asked, “Is it time?”
Zhu Yunwen nodded slightly. From the wooden box on the table, he took out a sealed letter and said, “Master’s prediction has yet to be unsealed in my possession.”
From his sleeve, Dao Yan retrieved a letter with intact sealing wax and said softly, “Your Majesty’s prediction remains intact.”
Using a small knife, Zhu Yunwen broke the seal, took out Dao Yan’s prediction, and asked, “If Master’s prediction is incorrect, please remain by my side and lend your support to the Great Ming.”
A slight tremor passed over Dao Yan’s emaciated face as he tore open the envelope, took out the contents, and said solemnly, “If Your Majesty’s prediction is incorrect, please honor your promise and allow this humble monk to return to the Qing Shou Temple in Beiping.”
“Hahaha, it’s a deal.”
Zhu Yunwen unfolded Dao Yan’s prediction, which contained only nine characters:
Implement the New Military Policy, be loyal to the Emperor, and serve the country.
Dao Yan unfolded Zhu Yunwen’s prediction and looked down. His pupils suddenly dilated as he read the eight characters written on it:
Feign madness to avoid calamity, bide time, and act.
Zhu Yunwen pointed to the urgent report from Beiping Prefecture, laughed heartily, and left the Hall.
Uneasily, Dao Yan opened the urgent report, his hands trembling, and with a fearful expression, he looked toward the door. Standing there proudly in the cold wind was the emperor of the Great Ming Empire—Zhu Yunwen!

Chapter 41: “Cat Theory” and Yang Shiqi
Having a deep understanding of Yin and Yang and the ability to perceive hidden truths, Dao Yan knelt down and paid his respects to Zhu Yunwen.
Zhu Yunwen issued an edict to restore Dao Yan’s secular name, Yao Guangxiao, and appointed him as the Left Buddhist Patriarch in the Central Buddhist Registry. He was also granted a position in the Hanlin Academy as an Hanlin Academician Expositor-in-waiting, responsible for reading historical books to the emperor, explaining classics, and providing advice.
Yao Guangxiao looked at Zhu Yunwen, unable to believe his ears.
Being an Hanlin Academician Expositor-in-waiting in the Hanlin Academy meant being half a member of the Grand Secretariat. Although lacking actual power, they possess the ability to influence the Emperor’s decisions!
How can one enter the Hanlin Academy without a distinguished past, without any background, without having passed the imperial examination, without any achievements, and without any governance experience, in relation to Emperor Jianwen and the Great Ming?
Originally, Yao Guangxiao thought that Zhu Yunwen’s decision to keep him was just a superficial excuse, randomly placing him in some insignificant position. However, now it seemed that Zhu Yunwen was serious, genuinely intending to utilize him!
Could it be that I Yao Guangxiao after decades of wasted time, would finally have the opportunity to fulfill my ambitions and not let my lifelong studies go in vain?
Yao Guangxiao’s promotion sparked intense debates in the court. Some officials petitioned, directly criticizing Zhu Yunwen, hoping that the emperor would not make arbitrary appointments and not heed malicious rumors. Some even went as far as to claim that there was no place for monks in the court.
However, these individuals forgot that Zhu Yuanzhang himself was once a monk. Why couldn’t Ming Dynasty have one more monk?
In his anger, Zhu Yunwen took out Deng Xiaoping’s “Cats theory” and wrote a three-thousand-word article, venting his dissatisfaction, expressing his innermost thoughts:
No matter if it’s a black cat or a white cat, as long as it can catch mice, it is a good cat.
Regardless of being a monk or a nun, as long as one possesses talent and ability, they can serve as officials.
Those who are capable will rise, while those who are mediocre will fall.
If you dare to hold onto your position without doing anything, I will let you be laid off and redirected to contribute to the agricultural development of Ming Dynasty.
“The way to recruit talent lies in observing their character, discerning their abilities, and utilizing the right people. After perusing numerous books, I particularly appreciate the following phrase: I urge Heaven to value vigor and not confine talent to any specific mold. After much consideration, I believe that this statement should serve as the fundamental strategy for selecting talent within the empire!”
Zhu Yunjuan’s article received great acclaim, from Xie Jin’s admiration to Xu Huizu’s skyward roar, and eventually, all officials paid their respects. All of this took only two days.
“Cats Theory” became the focal point of discussion in the Grand Secretariat and the Six Ministries, spreading from the court to the common people.
In no time, hand-copied versions of “Cats Theory” became the most popular reading material among the citizens of Nanjing. Seeing this trend, some bookstores even rushed to print and sell “Cats Theory” in the capital. Merchants leaving the capital would also bring along substantial copies of “Cats Theory”.
Soon after, “Cats Theory” by Emperor Jianwen started appearing in various places, including Suzhou, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Kaifeng, Jinan, Beijing, and others.
Wuchang Prefecture, Jiangxia.
A gentleman in his thirties, dressed in a dark blue robe, smiled and nodded at the children in the study hall. After the children paid their respects, they left the study hall.
To call this place a study hall was not entirely appropriate.
It was merely a makeshift room that had been tidied up.
And the students were just a few children from the countryside.
“Teacher Yang, haha, you’re still here,” Vice Director Ding Jin, walked briskly into the study hall, loudly calling out.
Yang Shiqi closed the book he was holding, “The Great Learning,” and looked up at Ding Jin, who had reached the doorway. He stood up and saluted, saying, “You are too kind, Vice Director.”
“Haha, there’s no need for such courtesy between us,” Ding Jin laughed heartily, lifted the food and winse in his hand, and said, “Today, I bring good news.”
“Good news?”
Yang Shiqi was somewhat surprised, looking at Ding Jin, not understanding what had happened.
Ding Jin pulled Yang Shiqi to sit down, placed the food and wine on the table, and said with a smile, “It’s a great joy! Teacher Yang, you are going to the capital!”
“To the capital?”
Yang Shiqi stood up, his face filled with astonishment.
Ding Jin gestured for Yang Shiqi to sit down, rubbed his hands together, glanced at the dilapidated study hall, and said, “Your place here is too cold. But the days of hardship are over. First, read this article.”
Yang Shiqi took the article that Ding Jin pulled out from his pocket, lowered his head, and saw the words “Cats Theory” written on it. He couldn’t help but smile and say, “When did cats become something worth your surprise?”
“Just keep reading.”
Ding Jin filled his cup with wine and took a sip on his own.
Yang Shiqi carefully read through the article, and his originally smiling face gradually became serious. When he read the line “I urge Heaven to value vigor and not confine talent to any specific mold,” he even slapped the table and exclaimed, “What a great article!”
“Keep it down, you might spill my wine. Then I’ll have to punish you for disrespect!” Ding Jin chuckled.
Yang Shiqi continued to read the article several times, marveling at it, and said, “This ‘Cats Theory’ is straightforward and easy to understand, it establishes its point clearly, and it is remarkably distinctive. Reading it is like having a thunderous awakening and a sudden enlightenment. What is talent? How to select talent? It should be done according to this strategy for governing the world. Our current emperor is a wise ruler. I must pay my respects!”
After Yang Shiqi finished speaking, he placed “Cats Theory” on the table with utmost respect and performed a solemn bow.
Ding Jin nodded heavily, stood up, and accompanied Yang Shiqi in bowing.
Although “Cats Theory” was only three thousand words long, But if this argument is accepted, it signifies that the talents of the Great Ming will be given opportunities for prominent positions! Meanwhile, those mediocre individuals who have been idle and lived off their positions will be kicked out.
Yang Shiqi was not just bowing to Emperor Zhu Yunwen but also to the future of Ming Dynasty!
“Today, we won’t return until we are drunk!”
Yang Shiqi said solemnly.
Ding Jin burst into laughter and said, “If we don’t return until we are drunk, then let’s not talk about it. Drink less so that your old mother won’t worry.”
Yang Shiqi laughed heartily, tears glistening in his eyes.
After the New Year, he would turn thirty-six.
At the age of one, he lost his father and traveled with his mother.
At the age of six, his mother remarried to Luo Xing, and he changed his surname to Luo.
During the ancestral worship in the Luo family, he made a clay statue to worship his ancestors from the Yang family. Luo Xing discovered it and recognized his ambition, so he restored his Yang surname and supported him in pursuing education.
Later, Luo Xing offended a powerful figure and was sent to the frontier, where he passed away.
With no one to rely on, he could only bring his elderly mother and make a living by teaching.
Although he had served as a local teaching officer, he lost his official seal and had to flee with his mother, wandering and seeking refuge in Hubei and Hunan.
People are not afraid of hardships; they fear not seeing the end of their hardships.
Yang Shiqi understood clearly that with the publication of “Cats Theory,” his day of success would come.
Ding Jin raised his wine bowl and smiled, saying, “Teacher Yang, the magistrate of Hanyang Wang Shuying, and Hanlin Academician Fang Xiaoru, are close friends. Wang Shuying highly values your talent. After the New Year, it will be the first year of the Jianwen reign. The Emperor will surely order the compilation of the ‘Veritable Records of the Ming Dynasty.’ Magistrate Wang has already recommended you to the higher authorities. I believe it won’t be long before you enter the capital.”
Yang Shiqi smiled and said, “If that’s the case, I should express my gratitude to Magistrate Wang.”
“Just thank Magistrate Wang? What about me?”
“Naturally, I am grateful as well. Haha.”
The two laughed heartily in the dilapidated study hall.
In mid-December, in the King of Yan’s Mansion in Beiping.
Zhu Di had been acting crazy for a while, but pretending to be mad all the time wasn’t a good solution. After all, winter swimming wasn’t that cold, but if he didn’t change clothes after coming ashore, he would freeze to death.
Acting crazy and foolish was acceptable, but if he went too far and lost his life, it wouldn’t be worth it.
So Zhu Gaochi and others arranged for the King of Yan’s guards to tie up Zhu Di and bring him back to the King of Yan’s Mansion. Although he occasionally went out to cause trouble, the frequency became less and less. Eventually, he simply hid at home and acted crazy.
Some time ago, Zhu Di received a letter from King of Ning, Zhu Quan, which described the “Palace Debate” between Zhu Quan and Zhu Yunwen before Zhu Quan left the capital. He advised Zhu Di to give a similar performance and wrap it up.
Zhu Di hid in a corner of the house, wrapped in a quilt, shivering as he watched the door. After the commotion at the door subsided, he stopped trembling.
At the end of November, Zhu Gaochi, on behalf of Zhu Di, promised safety and implemented the New Military Policy into the Three Guards, stabilizing the Three Guards and buying time.
However, what Zhu Gaochi didn’t expect was that the New Military Policy was not just about policies but also about ideology.
Zhu Yunwen’s intention was clear. Since you have implemented New Military Policy, it is only natural to accept ideological education that promotes “loyalty to the emperor and patriotism, defending our Ming Dynasty’s mountains and rivers.”
As a result, a group of Confucian scholars were stationed in each guard.
These scholars had a solid foundation in the ideology of loyalty to the emperor and patriotism, and conducting ideological education and cultural propaganda was a matter of course. However, Zhu Yunwen highlighted certain key points to strengthen the effectiveness of ideological education.
To cultivate the soldiers the will to ‘fear no hardship and fight tenaciously’, to instill in them the belief in ‘fighting for their family, their country, and the Great Ming, willing to kill enemies a thousand miles away and die a heroic death,’ and to foster their aspirations of ‘achieving meritorious deeds and being rewarded with high positions despite starting from humble beginnings’…
Zhu Di understood that the current Three Guards of King of Yan, although still bearing the name “King of Yan,” had essentially become Zhu Yunwen’s personal guard.
Before the Three Guards begin their training, they must swear loyalty to the court, loyalty to the Jianwen Emperor, and loyalty to the Great Ming. After the training, they must shout the slogan “For the country, kill the enemy, and fear no death.” Even before the soldiers go to sleep, they have to shout out loud, “Build the New Army, defend our mountains and rivers.”
Even the veteran soldiers and generals of the King of Yan’s Mansion gradually become distant from the King of Yan’s Mansion.
Footsteps were heard outside the door, and Zhu Di immediately trembled.
The door opened, and Zhu Gaochi walked in, closed the door, approached Zhu Di, and knelt down, presenting a small booklet to Zhu Di, saying, “Father, news has come from the capital. Master Dao Yan has entered the Hanlin Academy. This ‘Cats Theory’ is a strategy written by the Emperor for the appointment of Master Dao Yan, also known as the ‘Talent Theory of the Great Ming.'”
Zhu Di stopped trembling, his scattered gaze gradually focused, looking deeply at Zhu Gaochi, and asked, “Master Dao Yan has entered the Hanlin Academy?”
Zhu Gaochi nodded sadly and said, “It is absolutely true.”
The corners of Zhu Di’s mouth trembled, his eyes filled with disbelief, and he said, “This can’t be true! Master Dao Yan has a deep and loyal relationship with me. He is my confidant. I have known him for over ten years. How can this be possible!”
Zhu Gaochi sighed and said, “I don’t know the details, but the fact remains. According to the information obtained from King of Ning, it is highly likely that the Emperor has already anticipated our every move, Father, we… should lower our heads!”
Zhu Di leaned against the wall and chuckled.
Countless times, he had dreamed of taking over the imperial seal from his father, Zhu Yuanzhang, and sitting on the supreme throne, giving orders, and ruling over the Great Ming!
But would dreams ultimately be shattered by reality?
Zhu Yunwen!
His good nephew!
He was a cunning person, a capable person, and apparently a competent emperor!
But to make him bow and submit!
He was unwilling!
“Father, Big Brother.”
Zhu Gaoxu rushed into the room, bringing a gust of cold wind and uttered a sentence that made Zhu Di and Zhu Gaochi shudder:
“Master Dao Yan has returned!”

Chapter 42: The Last Mediator, Zhu Di’s Return
“Dao Yan is back?”
Zhu Di abruptly stood up, looking surprised at Zhu Gaoxu, then turned his gaze to Zhu Gaochi, asking, “Didn’t you just say that Dao Yan entered the Hanlin Academy and is currently in the capital?”
Zhu Gaochi frowned as he held the “Cats Theory” in his hand and said, “The news I just received is indeed true. Second brother, what’s going on?”
Zhu Gaoxu quickly said, “I am also unaware of the situation, but Master Dao Yan has already arrived outside the King of Yan’s residence.”
Zhu Di kicked off the blanket and wanted to go out to greet Dao Yan, but Zhu Gaochi held him back and said, “Father, Dao Yan’s entry into the Hanlin Academy is information from the capital, sent by our people. It is absolutely reliable. If he has truly come to Beiping, it must be at the Emperor’s behest. You cannot see him!”
Zhu Gaoxu also blocked the door and advised, “Big brother is right. It could be the Emperor sending him to test you.”
“Anyone in the world can betray me, Zhu Di, except for Master Dao Yan!”
Zhu Di wanted to go out and meet Dao Yan, but Zhu Gaochi and Zhu Gaoxu were adamant in stopping him.
Dao Yan arrived in the capital in September and now, three months later, he has returned to Beiping.
Has people’s hearts changed? Who can say for sure?
According to the news from the capital, Dao Yan’s current position is that of a Hanlin Academician Expositor-in-waiting. In simpler terms, he is by Zhu Yunwen’s side. If Dao Yan were to see Zhu Di pretending to be mad and report it to the Emperor, it would be a crime of disrespecting the court and deceiving the ruler.
“Very well, bring him in.”
Zhu Di sat back in the corner with a gloomy face.
Zhu Gaozhi and Zhu Gaoxu, seeing this, reluctantly left the inner residence to meet Dao Yan.
Upon seeing the familiar two princes, Dao Yan greeted them and sighed, “Your Highnesses, I came here today only hoping to see the King of Yan and exchange a few words. I request your permission.”
“A few words? Or a few messages?”
Zhu Gaoxu’s eyes carried a hint of dissatisfaction. He had seen the news from the capital and the intelligence provided by this source had never been wrong. If it said that Dao Yan entered the Hanlin Academy, then he must have entered.
If Dao Yan only wanted to speak, that would be fine, as he would still be one of their own. But if he wanted to deliver a message, then he would be a supporter of Emperor Jianwen.
“Heh, it’s a combination of both.”
Dao Yan said calmly, disregarding Zhu Gaoxu’s coldness.
Zhu Gaoxu abruptly stood up, but Zhu Gaochi quickly stopped him, gesturing for him to sit down, and then said to Dao Yan, “I heard that Master entered the Hanlin Academy. Is the news accurate?”
Dao Yan nodded earnestly and said, “It is as commanded by the Emperor.”
Zhu Gaochi and Zhu Gaoxu looked at Dao Yan, both finding it difficult to accept this outcome. After all, Dao Yan had been working in the King of Yan’s residence for over ten years. It could be said that he had been with Zhu Gaochi and Zhu Gaoxu for a long time.
Now, their once trusted friend had sided with Zhu Yunwen!
What loyalty could there be between them now?
Suppressing the anger in his heart, Zhu Gaochi stood up and said, “Father’s health hasn’t been good recently. When Master sees him, please try to keep some distance and be cautious.”
Dao Yan chuckled and thanked him, saying, “I hope your highnesses can lead the way.”
Zhu Gaochi and Zhu Gaoxu escorted Dao Yan to the inner residence. Zhu Gaoxu gave Zhu Gaochi a glance and then positioned himself behind, whispering to Qiu Fu as they passed by, “If he is a secret agent of the court, we cannot let him leave the inner residence alive!”
Qiu Fu solemnly nodded in response.
Zhu Gaochi stopped in his tracks, pushed open the door, and said, “Master, please enter.”
Dao Yan lifted his foot and entered the room. He looked at Zhu Gaochi and Zhu Gaoxu, who wanted to follow him inside, and said, “I kindly request that the two princes allow this old monk to have a private conversation with the King of Yan.”
Zhu Gaochi frowned slightly but eventually nodded.
Dao Yan closed the door behind him and walked towards the room. He looked at Zhu Di, sitting in the corner with disheveled hair and a blanket draped over him. His gaze was filled with unfamiliarity and vigilance.
Is this acting?
It was both admirable and heartbreaking in its authenticity.
Dao Yan walked to a spot not far from Zhu Di, sat on the ground, twirled his Buddhist beads, and sighed, “Your Highness, you and I met in the fifteenth year of the Hongwu era. Counting carefully, it has been nearly seventeen years. In life, how many seventeen-year periods are there?”
Seeing Zhu Di remain silent, Dao Yan didn’t mind and continued, “This humble monk is already sixty-four years old. In another seventeen years, will I still be alive? If I were to pass away in obscurity, with no one knowing the name of Dao Yan, what would be the purpose of my lifelong learning and endeavors? I would rather die in a thunderstorm than grow old on a sickbed!”
“Therefore, serving by your highness’s side, inciting and plotting, is nothing more than to overturn the world, witness the ever-changing fortunes, and leave my name in the annals of history. It is to prove that my life’s path is not unworthy of my learned skills!”
“Since the passing of Emperor Taizu and the ascension of Emperor Jianwen, I have secretly observed Jianwen. But he is nothing more than a weak scholar, unable to withstand a single blow. Your Highness, your hegemonic ambitions are within reach! However, it was only after entering the capital in September and discussing the world with Emperor Jianwen that I woke up to the realization. The current Emperor is no ordinary monarch. He possesses the dominating aura to establish an everlasting legacy, the boldness to govern the land, the ability to control the tides of fortune, and the astonishing talent to foresee and plan!”
At this point, Dao Yan paused, his gaze fixed deeply on Zhu Di, and he said solemnly, “What you are doing now, the Emperor has foreseen since September. The Emperor has never taken action because he doesn’t want you to raise an army, he doesn’t a fight within family, and most importantly, he doesn’t want you, Your Highness, to meet your demise on your journey south. So, Your Highness, please stop pretending.”
Zhu Di looked at Dao Yan, and his gaze gradually became clear. He stood up, tidied his hair, and chuckled, “So it seems that Master’s visit today is to persuade me?”
Dao Yan looked at Zhu Di, who was indeed pretending to be mad, and was convinced of Zhu Yunwen’s prediction. He stood up and said, “To persuade? Perhaps. My purpose in coming here is to hope that the King of Yan and I can work together to achieve greatness.”
“Greatness? Haha, Dao Yan, you have entered the Hanlin Academy, but what greatness can there be? I’m afraid that once you leave the residence, I will already be imprisoned!”
Zhu Di angrily shouted.
Dao Yan took a step forward and solemnly said, “Your Highness, when I speak of working together for a great cause, it is not about treason but about the internal and external affairs of the Ming Dynasty. Internally, it means ushering in an era of prosperity, and externally, it means expanding our territory and opening up the Silk Road once again, reviving the glory of the Han and Tang dynasties, and witnessing a brilliant era of prosperity.”
Zhu Di waved his sleeve and said, “What does that have to do with me? History will only remember Zhu Yunwen and not me, Zhu Di!”
Dao Yan fell silent.
Zhu Di sat at the desk, drinking his wine.
Suddenly, Dao Yan broke the silence and said, “If history remembers Your Highness, would you be willing to submit to the Emperor?”
Zhu Di frowned and looked at Dao Yan, asking, “What do you mean?”
Dao Yan’s gaze was profound as he said to Zhu Di, “Has Your Highness not read ‘Cats Theory’?”
Zhu Di was somewhat surprised. Not long ago, Zhu Gaochi brought a booklet titled “Cats Theory”, but he hadn’t had the chance to read it. Could it be that there was something mysterious about this “Cats Theory”?
Dao Yan took out a handwritten copy of “Cats Theory” from his pocket and handed it to Zhu Di, saying, “Your Highness, this is ‘Cats Theory’ written by the current Emperor. It has already been copied and circulated countless times, and it is known throughout the government offices and counties.”
Zhu Di opened “Cats Theory” and carefully read it, being amazed by Zhu Yunwen’s novel ideas and perspectives.
It’s true, regardless of whether a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice, it is a good cat.
Zhu Yunwen followed this principle, not asking about one’s background, embracing diversity, and daring to employ capable individuals. The key is to govern the country with talent and policies, and that is also correct.
“Cats Theory” is irrefutable and beneficial to the Ming Dynasty.
Zhu Di’s hand trembled. Zhu Yunwen had only been on the throne for half a year, but he had already demonstrated astonishing talents in governing:
With his New Military Policy, he had won the hearts of the military with his upright and noble tactics.
With “Cats Theory” he had captured the hearts of the literati and scholars across the country.
It was heard that the court would soon implement a Single Whip Law, reforming agricultural taxes. At that time, the hearts of the people would undoubtedly be won over.
There were signs that Zhu Yunwen was dismantling the barriers of commerce. Zhang Bing in Beiping had dared to remove the restrictions on merchants’ household registrations, which was a sign. Once implemented, it would undoubtedly receive strong support from the merchant class.
In just half a year, Zhu Yunchen had made multiple moves and achieved victories on various fronts.
If the military, scholars, people, and merchants all submitted to Emperor Jianwen, who could contend against him in the world?
Zhu Di felt a bitter taste. Could it be that his father was not wrong, and Zhu Yunwen would be the great emperor of the Ming Empire?
Dao Yan sensed Zhu Di’s hesitation and stepped forward, adding, “His Majesty entrusted me to deliver a message to Your Highness.”
Zhu Di put down “Cats Theory” and shook his head, saying with resignation, “Forget it, I have lost to him! This world belongs to Zhu Yunwen! I accept it. Tomorrow, I will willingly bind myself in the capital and submit to whatever consequences may follow.”
Dao Yan’s face tightened. He understood Zhu Di’s temperament, disposition, and way of thinking. He knew that Zhu Di would not easily admit defeat or submit. Approaching the desk, he said solemnly, “The message entrusted by His Majesty is this: ‘Uncle Yan, I need you, and the Ming Dynasty needs you. I wonder if the Fourth Uncle has the courage to join me in overcoming obstacles and forging a path that has never been seen in history?'”
Zhu Di looked at Dao Yan in astonishment and asked, “Did the Emperor really say that?”
Dao Yan nodded with a smile.
Zhu Di furrowed his brow and asked, “What is this unprecedented path?”
Dao Yan shook his head and sighed, “This monk doesn’t know, but in the Emperor’s presence, I saw a map of the world.”
“A map of the world?”
Zhu Di looked puzzled.
Dao Yan said seriously, “In that map of the world, the vastness of our Ming Dynasty was just one region among many in the universe. The scale of the universe was awe-inspiring. Although I don’t know how the Emperor obtained such a map, I believe it is related to the unprecedented path!”
Zhu Di was deeply shocked. The Ming Dynasty’s territory alone spanned nine million square kilometers. How could such a vast and boundless land be only a small region in the universe?
Was this true?
Wasn’t the Ming Dynasty the largest kingdom in the world?
Dao Yan advised, “If Your Highness doesn’t believe it, you can go to the capital and inquire with the Emperor. I can sense that in the Emperor’s mind, there is a grand chessboard, and that is the true unprecedented great cause!”
Zhu Di looked deeply at Dao Yan and slowly said, “I underestimated him. Well, now I have no other way to go, do I? Although the Three Guards are loyal to me, if I ask them to go against the court, I’m afraid no one will obey. Besides, there are Ping’an and Shengyong in Beiping, and there are Qu Neng, Guo Ying, Geng Bingwen, and Tie Xuan around. Ha, his plan is already in motion. Even if I have the intention to take action, I am powerless.”
“I, Zhu Di, submit!”
“I, Zhu Di, honor him as the Emperor!”
“I, Zhu Di, will entrust the rest of my life to follow the Emperor and forge an unprecedented path!”
With tears in his eyes, Dao Yan knelt down and pay respect according to the court’s regulations, and the proper protocols for officials.: “I greet the King of Yan.”
At this moment, he was the Hanlin Academician Expositor-in-waiting Yao Guangxiao, he was the King of Yan Zhu Di, and he was the Emperor of the Ming Dynasty, Zhu Yunwen!

Chapter 43: Ma Enhui Does Not Understand Business
As the New Year approached, Nanjing City became even livelier. Troupes, performers, and merchants from all over the country flocked to the capital, banging gongs and drums to attract customers.
The restaurants and teahouses were bustling with people. The streets and alleys were filled with visitors, friends, and families walking together, shoulder to shoulder. Particularly in the area near Wuding Bridge, Chaoku Street, the ten-mile Qinhuai River, and the Confucius Temple, the atmosphere was especially lively.
As dusk fell, many small courtyards along the Qinhuai River lit up lanterns, waiting for a romantic encounter.
Upon the river, the boat glides gracefully, accompanied by the sounds of flute and drum, and the rhythm of counting boards. A small boat with a black canopy approaches leisurely, and the copper bells on the canopy sway with the motion of the boat, producing a continuous and melodious tinkling sound.
Ma Enhui tightly held Zhu Yunwen’s hand, her face somewhat pale, and pleaded weakly for help.
Zhu Yunwen, however, was delighted and said to Ma Enhui, “How long has it been since you last visited this bustling place? Keeping to yourself all the time, you will fall ill.”
Ma Enhui pinched Zhu Yunwen forcefully, feeling somewhat wronged.
Where do the emperor and empress of an empire go to the Qinhuai River? If people find out, how can they continue to live? Is this what you call inspecting the people’s sentiments? Visiting the common folk?
I think you despise the beauties of the palace!
Ma Enhui lowered her head, afraid to look outside, fearing that some officials might see her, feeling utterly ashamed.
She blamed her own naivety. Zhu Yunwen said something, and she believed it without any doubts. Innocently, she followed him, walking through the streets and watching performances during the daytime, which was exciting. But now it was nightfall, and they didn’t return to the palace; instead, they arrived at the Qinhuai River…
Ma Enhui held onto Zhu Yungui and pleaded, “Let’s go back quickly. This is not the place we should be.”
“Why not? There are many delicious foods along the Qinhuai River. There’s Fang’s lotus silk candy and Liu’s scalded pancake… Don’t you want to taste them?”
Zhu Yunwen asked with a smile.
Ma Enhui swallowed and asked, “Your Majesty… Did you bring me here just for the food?”
Zhu Yunwen laughed heartily, “Why not? Lately, your appetite hasn’t been good, and you barely eat anything. In the end, it’s because you’ve been staying indoors for too long. Going out, seeing things, and relaxing will be good for you. What do you think I came here for?”
Ma Enhui blushed and said, “I, I thought you brought me here just to eat delicious food.”
“Really?”
“Really!”
“You’re not lying?”
Haiya, women’s words should not be exposed. Zhu Yunwen rubbed his waist and sternly glared at Ma Enhui. Ma Enhui hummed and directed Liu Changge, “Pass through here quickly.”
Liu Changge didn’t dare to provoke, she even dare to pinch the Emperor, and disobedience might result in being kicked into the Qinhuai River.
On both sides of the Qinhuai River, there were narrow waterways, and water gates were set up at the mouths of these waterways. When the water gates were opened, boats could travel along the waterways to reach picturesque places.
A larger flower boat came head-on, and the people on the boat shouted, “Boats in front, move aside and give way.”
Liu Changge turned to look at Zhu Yunwen, Zhu Yunwen chuckled and said, “Since when have we ever given way to others?”
Hearing this, Liu Changge felt relieved. Truly, he was an emperor, so domineering. he shouted, “Boats in front, move aside and give way!”
The people on the flower boat were immediately stunned. They looked at the inconspicuous small awning boat in front of them, then looked at their own large flower boat beneath their feet, and only then realized that their boat was much grander.
“Make way! If you don’t move, we’ll capsize your boat!”
The people on the flower boat shouted loudly.
Liu Changge swiftly raised the bamboo pole in his hand, and a splash of water shot out, as he shouted sternly, “If you dare to come, you’re seeking death!”
The water splashed onto the face of the person on the flower boat, even from a distance of over ten meters.
“How dare you!”
The boatman wiped the water off his face and angrily yelled.
“What’s happening? Why aren’t we moving forward?”
King of Liao, Zhu Zhi walked out, noticing the commotion outside.
King of Min, Zhu Geng followed and admired the bustling night scene, sighing, “The capital is prosperous. If I could spend my whole life here, it wouldn’t be in vain.”
“Sir, there’s a small boat blocking the way ahead.”
The boatman pointed to the nearby small boat and said.
Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng looked down.
Zhu Zhi rubbed his eyes and said, “I feel like I’ve seen the person at the bow somewhere before.”
Zhu Geng nodded in agreement, “It does seem familiar, but the lights on the shore are too dim to see clearly.”
Liu Changge widened his eyes and looked at Zhu Yunwen and Ma Enhui, saying, “It’s King of Liao and King of Min.”
Ma Enhui snorted, expressing her dissatisfaction.
Zhu Yunwen smiled knowingly. It might not be a bad thing that these vassal kings were obsessed with a peaceful life. When the time was ripe, their fiefdoms could be reclaimed, thus resolving the issue of vassal kings annexing land.
Stepping onto the bow of the boat, Zhu Yunwen shouted amidst the shocked gazes of Ma Enhui and Liu Changge, “If you don’t move aside now, I’ll capsize your boat into the river!”
The boatmen and boatmen on the flower boat refused to back down. They rolled up their sleeves, and some started to curse. However, they had only uttered two words when Zhu Zhi kicked them into the water.
“Your, Your…”
Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng were dumbfounded, unsure of how to address Zhu Yunwen here.
If they called him “Your Majesty,” the Qinhuai River would explode. If they didn’t, would it be disrespectful?
Heavens, Your Royal Highness, wouldn’t it be better for you to stay obediently in the palace?
Why did you come to the Qinhuai River? Isn’t this asking for our lives?
What if this news reaches Kunji’s ears? It would lead to a fire burning down the three palaces and six courts!
“Clear the way!”
Zhu Yunwen shouted.
“Move, move! Move aside quickly!”
Zhu Zhi hurriedly shouted at the boatmen.
Liu Changge looked at the unobstructed waterway, smiled, and rowed the boat. As the small awning boat brushed against the flower boat, Zhu Zhi and Zhu Geng waved repeatedly, watching the small boat depart.
“Did you see that?”
Zhu Zhi asked Zhu Geng.
Zhu Geng shook his head firmly and said, “I didn’t see anything, didn’t see a thing!”
Zhu Zhi nodded emphatically. He didn’t see any woman on the emperor’s boat either!
He couldn’t even say it even if his life depended on it!
“Are you still going to find your beloved beauty?”
Zhu Geng asked tremblingly.
Zhu Zhi looked down, with a mournful expression, and said, “Let’s go back to the mansion.”
After getting off the boat, Zhu Yunwen took Ma Enhui and entered a shop, inquired for a while, then entered another shop and chatted with the shopkeeper. It was late at night and the streets were quiet before they returned to the palace.
Having too many royal banquets, occasionally enjoying some popular snacks and delicacies was also good. At least Ma Enhui’s appetite had improved a lot.
On the bed, Zhu Yunxuan flipped through the “History of the Song Dynasty”, and Ma Enhui brought a bowl of ginseng soup and sat beside him, asking, “Was Your Majesty’s trip for the matter of commercial taxes?”
Zhu Yunwen nodded and said to Ma Enhui, “For thousands of years, the four classes of people—scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants—have been mentioned. Merchants have always been in the lowest position, which is inappropriate.”
“I dare not disagree with Your Majesty’s words, but merchants are constantly on the move and do not engage in production. They accumulate wealth and exploit the common people. Emperor Taizu prohibited commerce, which was well-received by the people.”
Ma Enhui countered.
Zhu Yunwen closed the “History of the Song Dynasty” and sighed, “Even the beloved consort thinks the same. It shows that commercial reform is a hundred times more difficult than agricultural reform.”
Ma Enhui asked puzzledly, “Why does Your Majesty want to lift the ban on merchants? If that happens, everyone in the country will engage in commerce. Wouldn’t the land of the Ming Dynasty become barren? The farmland will be overgrown with weeds. How can the Ming Dynasty be prosperous?”
Zhu Yunwen furrowed his brows.
In the future, when the market economy is implemented, not all people engage in commerce despite fierce competition in the business world. But why in this ancient era, are there so many concerns?
Engaging in commerce also requires intelligence. It’s not as simple as bringing a few coins, purchasing goods in Guangzhou, and selling them in Nanjing to make a profit.
It requires capital, costs, sales, and distribution channels.
Of course, it also requires taxation.
The marketplace is like a battlefield, and the proportion of heroics in the marketplace may not be lower than that on the battlefield.
“Lifting the ban on merchants can increase tax revenue and improve the financial situation. The future Ming Dynasty will need a lot of money to support it.”
Zhu Yunwen wanted to build a truly prosperous and wealthy Ming Empire. His ambitious plan was always constrained by limited finances.
Looking at it from the perspective of the New Military Policy alone, these soldiers are guarding the borders for the country. The people of the Ming Dynasty owe them gratitude! With the current financial resources of the Ming Dynasty, it is simply not enough to implement the New Military Policy throughout the entire army!
The Ministry of Revenue cannot invest all its financial resources into the military. After all, people need to eat, wives need to buy jewelry, and children need to attend private schools. If the court doesn’t have money to pay salaries, how can they work?
What to do without money?
The biggest way for historical dynasties to make money is to increase taxes and ask the common people for money.
Open your mouth and add another tax item, isn’t it easy?
Are bizarre taxes in history too few?
King Li of Zhou, Ji Hu’s drinking water tax, Emperor Hui of Han, Liu Ying’s bachelor tax, the shoe tax and barefoot tax in the late Qing Dynasty, the sunbathing tax imposed by warlords during the Republic of China…
Apart from bragging, what can’t be taxed?
But the common people have no money. By squeezing out half a tael of silver from one person, the entire empire will have thirty million taels of silver, enough to feed the people for a year.
As for the life and death of the common people, how many people really care?
Cannot blame Ma Enhui for not understanding the power of merchants. Because Zhu Yuanzhang was too vigorous, he suppressed the merchants to the extreme. The proportion of commercial taxes in the central finance of the Ming Dynasty was pitifully small, enough to make people cry.
Except for monopolistic salt taxes, all commercial taxes, such as tea tax, market ship tax, transaction tax, and business tax, added up to less than one million taels.
Relative to the thirty million taels in the central finance, the proportion is only in the single digits, a negligible amount.
Ma Enhui put away the book and asked softly, “If Your Majesty lifts the ban on merchants, how much more tax can be collected?”
Zhu Yunxuan got up and took the inkstone from the desk, handing it to Ma Enhui with a smile, “Beloved Consort, how much do you think this inkstone is worth?”
Ma Enhui played with the inkstone and looked at the carving of a dragon on it. She uncertainly said, “This jade inkstone should be worth a thousand taels?”
Zhu Yunxuan sat beside her and smiled, “Good, let’s price this jade inkstone at a thousand taels. How much tax should we collect?”
Ma Enhui furrowed her brows and calculated, “According to Emperor Taizu’s commercial tax, its 1/30. So, for this thousand taels, it should be a little over thirty-three taels.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at the inkstone and said with a bitter smile, “Thirty-three taels will go into the national treasury, but they will take away the majority. Hehe, lifting the ban on merchants wouldn’t be of much use either. But what if we adjust the tax rate from 1/30, to 1/20, or even 1/10?”
“1/10?”
Ma Enhui stood up in alarm and said, “Your Majesty, absolutely not. Setting aside the fact that the commercial tax was set by Emperor Taizu, adjusting it from 1/30 to 1/10 would suppress the merchants, which does not align with Your Majesty’s original intention, right?”

Chapter 44: The First Year of Jianwen! Enthronement of the Empress!
Is a tax rate of 1/30 high?
The commercial tax rate in the Ming Dynasty was not set too high, but rather too low!
And the excessively low commercial tax rate was not beneficial for the development of the Ming Dynasty.
Zhu Yuanzhang advocated light burdens and low taxes, but he never read “Capital” nor engaged in a market economy. Instead, he relied on his own firmness to shape a relatively rigid Ming Dynasty.
He established a framework and set rules, which must be followed by future generations. Then he went to reunite with Empress Ma.
However, what he didn’t know was that society is progressive and dynamic, not static. Zhu Yuanzhang failed to understand the principle that running water does not grow stale and a door hinge does not gather termites. His so-called eternal law was nothing but a joke in the face of historical inevitability.
Zhu Yunwen did not continue discussing the issue of commercial taxes with Empress Ma’enhui. Although she was an almost perfect wife, she lacked a business perspective, so any further discussion would be meaningless.
However, he would surely convince her. Otherwise, how could he persuade those stubborn officials?
On the eve of the Lunar New Year, in the Kunning Palace,
Ma Enhui personally helped Zhu Yunwen dress, a task she never entrusted to palace maids.
Looking at Zhu Yunwen, who was dignified and yet elegant, Ma Enhui smiled gently and said, “After today, tomorrow will be the new year, and the whole country will enter a new era. Even the common people will offer you longevity tablets.”
Zhu Yunwen pulled Ma Enhui to sit down and said, “Starting from tomorrow, everyone will need to address you as the Empress. Although the harem is small, it is not easy to manage. Don’t overwork yourself. Delegate some tasks to others.”
“I understand, but there is something I would like to discuss with Your Majesty.”
Empress Ma Enhui looked at Zhu Yunwen with bright eyes.
“What is it?”
Zhu Yunwen picked up a teacup.
Empress Ma’enhui looked at Zhu Yunwen earnestly and said, “Your Majesty, at the beginning of the new year, everything is renewed. I plan to select a group of talented women to enrich the harem.”
“Ha!”
Zhu Yunwen looked at Ma Enhui, put down the teacup he had spilled, and said, “Why bring up this matter again?”
Ma Enhui said with some resentment, “Currently, Your Majesty has only one son, Wengui. The bloodline is too thin. And, Your Majesty indulges me excessively. When it comes to sleeping together, you cannot always stay in the Kunning Palace, or else rumors will spread in the harem.”
“Huh?”
Zhu Yunwen felt annoyed. Was there something wrong with being with his wife?
But then he realized that he had more than one wife. Empress Ma Enhui was his lawful wife, and the other concubines in the harem were also his wives in name.
The wicked feudal society, the wicked royal family—was it appropriate to have so many wives?
Zhu Yunwen couldn’t break free from the concept of monogamy, so he said, “Let’s forget about selecting talented women. Let’s not choose for three years. We can discuss it again after three years.”
“Your Majesty!”
Ma Enhui grew anxious.
The imperial family valued the inheritance of bloodlines, while ordinary households had three or four sons. Zhu Yunwen had only one child, which was indeed too few.
“I am still young, and so are you. We have plenty of time,” Zhu Yunwen made up his mind.
Ma Enhui sighed and then said, “In that case, how about selecting some concubines from within the palace to serve Your Majesty? Apart from the Consort Ning and the Consort Xian, the harem is empty, and this is not a good situation.”
Zhu Yunwen waved his hand, a little impatiently, and said, “You can make the arrangements.”
Ma Enhui smiled and agreed.
Shuangxi led the other eunuchs saluted Zhu Yunwen and Ma Enhui, exclaiming in unison, “Congratulations to Your Majesty and Empress for eternal blessings and everlasting health. Long live His Majesty, long live the Empress.”
Zhu Yunwen looked at the kneeling eunuchs and said with a wave of his sleeve, “Please rise. You worked hard by my side, and it’s always a bit more difficult for you. Shuangxi, have the treasury distribute some New Year’s money to everyone.”
“Thank you for Your Majesty’s grace.”
The eunuchs expressed their gratitude.
After the eunuchs dispersed, Shuangxi entered the palace and reported, “Your Majesty, the officials from the Grand Secretariat and Ministry of Rites have replied. The New Year’s edict, the decree of the Empress’s enthronement, golden tablets, and golden treasures are all prepared and currently in the Fengtian Hall. Tomorrow morning, the envoys Fang Xiaoru and Xie Jin will present the decree, golden tablets, and golden treasures to the Empress.”
“Then the two envoys should be commended for their efforts.” Zhu Yunwen nodded in satisfaction and looked at Empress Ma Enhui. He said, “Let’s go. We will go and pay respects to the Empress Dowager. After that, you need to return home. Speaking of which, I haven’t seen Father-in-law for a long time.”
Ma Enhui was the daughter of Ma Quan, The vice minister of the court of imperial entertainment.
Although Ma Quan holds a fourth-ranking official position, he rarely attends court sessions. This is mainly because Ma Enhui is concerned about her father attracting unnecessary attention and causing trouble. She never allows anyone from the family to take advantage of their relationship with the palace, and she rejects all requests and pleas made by Ma’s relatives.
Ma Enhui will become the Empress of the Ming Empire tomorrow, yet the Ma family remains low-key as if they don’t exist at all.
“If your Majesty wishes to meet them, I will arrange for them to enter the palace on another day,” Ma Enhui replied with anticipation.
After paying respects to the Empress Dowager, Zhu Yunwen and Ma Enhui had a meal together in her presence until dusk. It was only then that Zhu Yunchen escorted Ma Enhui to the carriage, watching her about to leave the palace with reluctance. He said, “During the New Year’s Eve, families gather together and celebrate. But I will be left without anyone by my side.”
According to the court ceremonial system, before the empress is officially conferred, she needs to return home and wait for the envoys to arrive.
Ma Enhui looked at Zhu Yunwen, who seemed a little downcast and smiled lightly, saying, “Your Majesty, just this once. In the future, I will always be by your side, never to part again.”
Zhu Yunwen patted the carriage and watched it slowly move away.
“Your Majesty, where shall we go?”
Shuangxi asked as Zhu Yunwen turned around.
Zhu Yunwen blinked, pushing away his melancholic emotions. He took a deep breath and said, “Let’s return to the Wuying Hall. Instruct the kitchen to prepare dumplings. I feel like having some.”
The first day of the first month, New Year’s Day.
On this day, the official history of the Ming Dynasty entered the first year of Jianwen!
Just after the hours of tiger(3 a.m to 5 a.m), Zhu Yunwen was awakened by Shuangxi. After changing into ceremonial attire, the drowsy Zhu Yunwen was fully awakened by the elaborate and heavy clothing.
“Has the envoys for the conferment ceremony left the palace?” Zhu Yunwen asked.
Shuangxi quickly replied, “The imperial decree, golden tablets, and golden treasures have been taken out. It’s estimated that they have arrived at the Ma residence.”
Zhu Yunwen’s lips curved into a smile as he said, “A new beginning. Good. This empire should have a new atmosphere.”
The Ma residence.
Ma Quan, along with all his family members and servants, knelt and paid their respects.
Fang Xiaoru read the imperial decree with great vigor.:
“By the mandate of the Emperor, it is proclaimed: We have heard that the harmony of heaven and earth establishes the order of the world, and the sun and moon symbolize the eternal cycle. It is through internal governance that the foundation of human relations is established, and the harmonious sounds embody the principles of royal transformation.”
“To you, Lady Ma of the esteemed Ma family, daughter of the Vice Minister of the Court of Imperial Entertainments, Ma Quan, your gentle and virtuous nature reflects the exemplary qualities of historical figures. As my Empress, you will accompany me in ruling the realm, bringing peace and contentment to our inner court. It is all thanks to your merits that I can ascend the throne and face the world without worries. At the beginning of this new era, I rely on your support to fulfill my heavenly mandate and uphold the dignified rituals of our royal position.”
“By the gracious decree of the Empress Dowager, I hereby dispatch envoys bearing the golden imperial decree and treasures to proclaim you as the Empress. May you uphold virtuous teachings and display proper decorum. Embrace the spring radiance of Chang Le, exemplify the purity of summer, the warmth of winter, and foster the refined elegance of the palace. Commendable are your diligence in attire and punctuality in meals. Maintain an attitude of reverence and frugality as you lead the six palaces. As you ascend to the position of Empress, we shall carry out the ancestral rites and announce our everlasting prosperity to the world. This decree is given with great respect!”
Fang Xiaoru is truly a great Scholar, delivered the decree with modulation and emotion.
Ma Enhui received the decree and accepted the golden tablets and golden treasures.
Fang Xiaoru and Xie Jin, leading the envoy, knelt and paid their respects to Ma Enhui, shouting, “Long live the Empress!”
After the ceremony, Ma Enhui ascended the imperial carriage, under the escort of the Imperial Court, eunuchs, and officials. She entered the Fengtian Hall, moving gracefully with the phoenix crown, captivating Zhu Yunwen.
After Ma Enhui paid her respects to Zhu Yunwen, the two of them ascended the throne hand in hand.
Zhu Yunwen took his seat on the throne, while Ma Enhui sat upright on the phoenix chair. The civil and military officials knelt down to congratulate them.
Afterward, Zhu Yunwen and Ma Enhui had to enter the ancestral temple to pay respects to their ancestors. From that moment on, Ma Enhui truly moved from Chang’an Palace to the Kunning Palace.
After a long and complicated ceremony, more than four hours had passed.
In the Fengtian Hall
Zhu Yunwen, with an empty stomach, listened to the eunuch reciting the decree for the New Year and the accession to the throne.
The content of the decree was nothing more than proclaiming the new emperor’s ascension and praising his contributions to the Ming Empire. Of course, these contributions were not solely the emperor’s doing. The Grand Secretariat had merits, the six ministries deserved recognition, and the contributions of the officials could not be ignored.
In short, everyone was doing well, and everything was fine.
The first year of Jianwen had begun, and everyone should roll up their sleeves and work hard.
According to the custom, when a new emperor ascended the throne, a general amnesty would be granted. However, Zhu Yunwen disagreed with this and informed the Grand Secretariat in advance.
A general amnesty?
Who came up with this damn idea? Have they ever considered the efforts and time spent by the people to catch those criminals? Those criminals haven’t even completed their transformation yet, and they’re going to be released just because of a change in reign?
It’s absurd to a certain extent.
Even though Xie Jin has repeatedly explained that the individuals being released are not major villains or evildoers, but rather some petty thieves and swindlers, their release can demonstrate the Emperor’s benevolence. It is said to be an act of bestowing grace and benefits upon the world.
Zhu Yunwen rejected Xie Jin’s proposal. Let those people continue to enjoy their “self-guided tour” in prison, with free food and accommodation. Not everyone gets such treatment.
After the decree of the new reign was read, Zhu Yunwen stood up and said, “All officials in the capital, regardless of rank, shall receive an additional three months’ salary. Except for the necessary personnel on duty, you shall have ten days of rest. On the eleventh day of the first month, we shall resume the morning court. My esteemed ministers, you may withdraw.”
The officials rejoiced and expressed their gratitude with loud cheers.
After Zhu Yunwen left the Fengtian Hall, the Grand Secretaries of the Grand Secretariat, Yu Xin, Zhang Dan, and Xie Jin, discussed together and decided who would remain in the Grand Secretariat during the ten days.
Yu Xin wanted to spend more time with his wife and children. He said that if he didn’t spend time with them now, it wouldn’t matter if his children didn’t recognize him, but it would be a big problem if his wife didn’t recognize him.
Zhang Dan slapped his leg and said that his rheumatism was acting up, and he needed to stay at home and recuperate for a while.
Xie Jin spread his hands and said that his elderly father’s health was not good, and he needed to accompany him to see a doctor and get some prescriptions. He would accompany him throughout the process, even without taking off his clothes.
The three senior ministers exchanged glances, and no one was willing to stay behind on duty.
Xie Jin gritted his teeth and clenched his fist, hiding it in his sleeve.
Seeing the situation, Yu Xin and Zhang Dan’s expressions turned serious, and they also hid their hands in their sleeves.
Tension filled the air.
Officials from the six ministries, including Fang Xiaoru, Huang Zicheng, and Qi Tai, gathered around, ready to watch the spectacle.
Xie Jin sneered, “If that’s the case, don’t blame me for being impolite. You lose, don’t go back on your word.”
“Bring it on!” Yu Xin shouted.
Zhang Dan nodded slightly and solemnly said, “Then let’s begin! Hands up, rock, paper, scissors!”
The officials from the six ministries who were watching fainted one after another…
PS:
In ancient times, Yuan Dan referred to the first day of the lunar year. After the founding of the country, Yuan Dan was set as January 1st in the Gregorian calendar. The game of “rock, paper, scissors” can be traced back to the Hand Gesture Command during the Han Dynasty, as recorded in Xie Zhaozhe’s “Wuzazu” during the Ming Dynasty.

Chapter 45: The Joy of Making Dumplings
Zhongcui Palace.
Consort Ning, wearing a white fur coat, quietly gazes at a few branches of cold plum blossoms in the corner of the wall. She sighs softly and begins to recite:
“Year after year, amidst the snow, I often find myself intoxicated by the plum blossoms. Yet, no matter how I try to embrace their beauty, all I earn is a garment soaked with tears. This year, at the far corners of the earth, my temples are turning gray…”
“Your Ladyship, it’s cold and windy outside. Shall we return indoors?” the concerned maid suggests.
Consort Ning shakes her head slightly, raises her hand, and points at the plum blossoms, saying, “While the plum blossoms still bloom, what about this consort?”
Since the passing of Emperor Taizu in May and the subsequent change to the Jianwen era, it had been over half a year, but Consort Ning had only been able to see the Emperor a few times, and he had never even stayed or visited Zhongcui Palace.
Her heart had turned to ashes, abandoned like the snow.
“Consort Ning, His Majesty requests your presence,” a eunuch hurriedly approached.
Consort Han’s eyes brightened, and she quickly straightened her attire, taking a few quick steps forward as she asked, “Where is His Majesty?”
“In the Shangshan Hall, Your Ladyship,” the eunuch replied with reverence.
“The Shangshan Hall…” Consort Ning’s expression turned slightly uneasy. After all, the Shangshan Hall was a place for dining, and it should not be the setting for any other stories.
“Please inform His Majesty that I am feeling unwell today, and thus, I will not attend,” Consort Ning raised her hand and gently touched her forehead, speaking softly with a delicate tone.
The eunuch glanced at Consort Ning, performed a bow, and then exited the room.
The maid by Consort Ning’s side, seeing the eunuch leave, anxiously asked, “Your Ladyship, why did you…?”
Consort Ning glanced at the maid, her beautiful face slightly furrowed in sadness, and said, “What difference would it make if I went?”
In the depths of this Palace’s Harem, without the Emperor’s favor, she was like a wild grass by the roadside, unnoticed in its withering or flourishing, with no one stopping for its life or death.
Even if they met, what would it matter? It would be nothing more than a fleeting encounter, passing by each other without any connection.
He would not ask about her well-being, nor accompany her in the moments of romance. He had given all his affection to the Empress. She could only stay in Zhongcui Palace, changing her appearance in secrecy, experiencing one spring and autumn, and then another winter and summer.
Shangshan Hall.
Zhu Yunwen watched as Ma Enhui poured water into the flour, and he couldn’t help but want to laugh.
Sometimes there was too much water, so she added more flour, and other times there was too much flour, so she added more water. Before long, the large basin couldn’t contain it all.
Anxious, Ma Enhui didn’t dare to look at Emperor Zhu Yunwen. Her face flushed, and she clenched her little fist to punch the dough. She had just spoken a moment ago, confident that she could make good dough.
“Oh, Empress, isn’t this basin a bit small?” Emperor Zhu Yunwen suppressed his laughter and leaned closer to Ma Enhui, saying.
Ma Enhui’s brow was covered in fine sweat. She snorted and said defiantly, “Exactly! Who made the imperial kitchen provide such a small basin? How can we make a dough like this?”
The people in Shangshan Hall were about to faint.
Oh, Empress, if the basin were bigger, it would become a tub…
“How about we divide it into three basins? Perhaps Consort Ning and Consort Xian will also come,” Zhu Yunwen suggested.
Ma Enhui’s face turned even redder, but she nodded repeatedly. With Zhu Yunwen’s help, they divided the dough into three portions.
“Consort Xian meets the Emperor, Empress.”
After Consort Xian greeted the Emperor, she walked over as well. She wasn’t surprised to see the Emperor and Empress wearing aprons. This couple had always been a bit unrestrained within the palace, disregarding court etiquette.
Originally, Ma Enhui valued etiquette, but somehow the Emperor had influenced her.
Truly, it was said that those close to Vermillion would turn red, and those close to the Emperor would become unrestrained.
“Consort Xian, it’s perfect. Please help… uh, let the Empress teach you how to make the dough,” Zhu Yunwen sensed Ma Enhui’s resentful gaze and quickly corrected himself.
Consort Xian chuckled, took the apron from a maid, tied it around her waist, and washed her hands. She said, “Then, Empress, please kindly instruct this humble concubine…”
“Come, sister, start with this basin. I’ll watch you,” Ma Enhui, knowing that Consort Xian was from Anhui and fond of noodles, assumed that she must know the method of making dough. She herself didn’t know and couldn’t admit it, so she had to learn on the spot.
Consort Xian was quite knowledgeable. While kneading the dough, she explained to Ma Enhui, “The dough should be elastic, so you need to knead it thoroughly. The surface should be smooth. Start from the center, fold the ends, and then knead repeatedly…”
Ma Enhui gratefully glanced at Consort Xian and began to deal with her own dough.
Zhu Yunwen held a kitchen knife and chopped the meat filling. A eunuch approached and reported, “Consort Ning is feeling unwell and won’t be coming.”
As he gathered the meat filling together again with the kitchen knife, Zhu Yunwen asked the eunuch, “Not feeling well? Could she have caught a cold? Has the imperial physician examined her?”
The eunuch hesitated and said, “We don’t know. When we arrived, Consort Ning was enjoying the plum blossoms.”
Emperor Zhu Yunwen burst into laughter, suddenly chopping the kitchen knife on the cutting board, wiping his hands, and said to Shuangxi, “Consort Ning must have some grievances in her heart. Go and invite her.”
Shuangxi agreed and hurriedly left.
Ma Enhui looked at Emperor Zhu Yunwen and said, “Consort Ning is talented and somewhat aloof. Your Majesty, don’t take it to heart.”
Emperor Zhu Yunwen picked up a handkerchief from a palace maid’s tray, wiped the sweat from Ma Enhui’s forehead, and smiled, “I’ve neglected Consort Ning and Consort Xian. They have some temper, but it’s expected. Consort Ning is as cold as a plum, and Consort Xian is as gentle as the moon. They are both exceptional women, but the affairs of the Ming Dynasty are complicated, leaving little time to attend to other matters. Consort Xian, please don’t hold it against me.”
“Your Majesty’s focus on the nation is for the benefit of all the people. This humble concubine is not a woman preoccupied with personal matters. I only hope Your Majesty can free yourself from worries, and may the Ming Dynasty soon embrace an era of prosperity.”
Consort Xian respectfully bowed.
Zhu Yunwen helped Consort Xian up, nodded slightly, and said, “The era of prosperity will come. But what I am most concerned about now is when you will all finish making the dough so that our family can enjoy a reunion dinner with dumplings.”
“That would be wonderful.”
Consort Xian smiled and, together with Ma Enhui, finished kneading the dough. They then placed it in the dwindling fire of the stove.
Consort Ning eventually arrived.
Zhu Yunwen looked at the apologetic Consort Ning while chopping vegetables and said, “Today, there are no emperors, empresses, or concubines here, only our family. Since Consort Ning arrived late, naturally she should take on more responsibilities, so I’ll assign you the task of rolling out the dough.”
Consort Ning had never done farm work before, and she had never even set foot in the kitchen.
Seeing Consort Ning, who was sweating profusely and had no idea how to roll out the dough, Zhu Yunwen reluctantly let her go and took on the task himself.
Consort Xian had experience and her dumplings were shaped like crescent moons.
But when it came to the dumplings made by Ma Enhui, they looked more like lumps.
And as for Consort Ning, well, are you trying to stuff the dough to the point of bursting with so much filling?
She couldn’t wrap them properly and only knew how to stretch the dough, without realizing that she should use less filling…
Originally, Ma Enhui and Ningfei were anxious, but when they saw the flour on Zhu Yunwen’s face, they burst into laughter.
They were all joyous and filled with happiness.
Emperor Zhu Yunwen enjoyed this sense of togetherness, where everyone was present, and a meal of dumplings made even a distant place feel like home. Looking at the women in front of him, all smiling, memories that rolled on and on became an unreachable distance.
Farewell to the past and continue moving forward.
What would the glorious era of the Great Ming look like?
Would his grand plans and blueprints gradually become reality?
Could he handle the infinite variables and challenges that lay ahead?
Zhu Yunwen emerged from his contemplation and raised his cup, saying, “May future generations say after a thousand years: Han and Tang were no match for Great Ming. That will be enough!”

Chapter 46: National Day, None of the Three Major Symbols of the Founding of the Nation?
On the second day of the first lunar month,
Zhu Yunwen summoned Xie Jin, Xu Huizu, and Chen Di in the Wuying Hall.
After the three of them were seated, Zhu Yunwen went straight to the point and said, “In the twenty-eighth year of the Yuan Dynasty Zhizheng era, on the fourth day of the first lunar month, the founding emperor established the Great Ming dynasty. In two days’ time, it will be the thirty-second year since the establishment of the Great Ming. I intend to establish a national celebration, a festival of national unity, to be celebrated with the people, and make it a long-standing tradition. What do my three dear courtiers think?”
“A national celebration?” Xu Huizu was somewhat lost in thought.
He imagined his father, Xu Da, and how glorious he was in those turbulent times, laying the foundation of the Great Ming and achieving supreme merits. If a festival were to be established on the day of the country’s founding, commemorating the hardships of the nation’s establishment and showcasing the achievements of the founding generation, it would undoubtedly win the hearts of the people.
However…
Xie Jin marveled at Zhu Yunwen’s idea. Throughout history, although there have been national celebrations, they were merely “celebrations with the nation,” without a fixed date. It could be the day of the emperor’s ascension or a grand event that triggered a celebration. A festival commemorating the birth of the nation had never existed before.
But without much thought, he understood its benefits.
“Your Majesty, this plan is feasible! It should be vigorously implemented! Whether in the capital region or in all provinces, prefectures, and counties where our Great Ming citizens reside, let us celebrate and rejoice together on the same day!” Xie Jin solemnly replied.
Xie Jin was well aware that once the National Celebration Festival was deeply ingrained in the hearts of the people of the Great Ming, unprecedented unity would emerge. A united nation and empire would generate an unparalleled cohesion.
Chen Di, the Minister of Rites, applauded and praised, saying, “I second the proposal of Secretary Xie. The establishment of a National Celebration Festival should be implemented throughout the country. Although it may be somewhat hasty this year, it can still be accomplished in the capital. Seizing the momentum of the new era, it is better to issue the imperial decree to announce it to the world today.”
Xu Huizu stood up, his expression turning serious, and said, “Your Majesty, I support this plan, but there are some things that need to be said.”
Zhu Yunwen nodded in a gentle manner and raised his hand, saying, “Please sit down and speak freely. Between monarch and minister, we should be frank. Whatever you have to say, say it.”
Xu Huizu sat down and spoke earnestly, “National Day, the birth anniversary of the Great Ming, is not an insignificant event. I believe we can follow the example of the Twenty-Four Meritorious Officials of the Tang Dynasty and proclaim the names of Emperor Taizu and other prominent civil and military officials who contributed to the founding of our nation, spreading their fame throughout the land.”
Xie Jin furrowed his brows slightly and said, “Isn’t this matter a bit inappropriate?”
Xu Huizu looked at Zhu Yunwen with a struggling expression.
Indeed, as Xie Jin said, widely publicizing and following the example of the Twenty-Four Meritorious Officials of the Lingyan Pavilion would pose no problem if it were implemented by Zhu Yuanzhang himself at the beginning of the country’s founding.
But now it is the Jianwen era, not the Hongwu era! How should we promote it?
Shall we tell the world that these meritorious officials, who contributed greatly to the Great Ming, were ultimately betrayed by Zhu Yuanzhang?
How will the common people discuss Zhu Yuanzhang then?
Does the dignity of the founding emperor of the Great Ming Empire still hold any significance?
Moreover, are some of these meritorious officials truly guilty, or were they victims of wrongful accusations? Zhu Yuanzhang labeled them as traitors, and now Zhu Yunwen, immediately after inheriting Zhu Yuanzhang’s imperial seal, calls them meritorious officials?
At that time, will the people trust Zhu Yuanzhang or Zhu Yunwen?
Some matters cannot be openly discussed!
Xiejing understands this principle, and he also understands Xu Huizu’s desire to rectify the reputation of his ancestors through National Day.
Although Xu Da had a peaceful end,
what about Feng Sheng, Fu Youde, and Wang Bi who were implicated in the Lan Yu Case?  And Those like Liao Yongzhong who died due to the “improper use of dragon and phoenix” all had contributions.
Weren’t they also deserving of recognition? Weren’t they also victims of injustice?!
As the foremost military official, Xu Huizu’s sentiments are justified, but they are also unrealistic. Xu Huizu lowered his head in despair, understanding that his thoughts were nothing but delusions. The royal family cannot be held accountable, nor can the monarch be blamed. No matter how they died, those individuals can never be posthumously vindicated.
Their grievances can only remain buried in their graves, subject to the cycles of nature. Their descendants will inevitably bear this heavy burden, living in a state of meekness and enduring the contempt of others.
Zhu Yunwen looked at Xu Huizu, knowing that this matter had far-reaching implications.
In other words, rectifying their names is a minor issue compared to the broader task of promoting and publicizing the National Day.
It should be noted that although Zhu Yunwen is the grandson of Zhu Yuanzhang, there are still plenty of Zhu Yuanzhang’s sons around. If these grandsons go around the world speaking ill of their grandfather, can those uncles just sit idly by and do nothing? They might even take up arms and march straight to the capital.
In such a scenario, the whole country would descend into chaos, and how could we focus on economic development and construction?
After all, the New Military Policy have not yet been widely implemented. The control of the King of Ning, King of Gu, King of Su, King of Qing, and others over the Imperial Guards cannot be underestimated. Until the strategic objective of consolidating power and weakening the feudal forces is achieved, this matter cannot be carried out.
“Duke of Wei, I promise you that it will be resolved within ten years. This matter requires patience and careful planning. Acting hastily could lead to disastrous consequences. We need to proceed gradually,” Zhu Yunwen said solemnly.
Xu Huizu was instantly moved to tears. If this matter could be resolved while he was still alive, even if he died, he could go to the afterlife with a smile, gloriously meeting his ancestors. Xu Huizu stood up, solemnly knelt down, and shouted, “I express gratitude on behalf of all the honored officials to Your Majesty for this heavenly favor.”
There was some concern in Xie Jin’s brows and eyes. Ten years might seem long, but accomplishing this task wouldn’t be easy.
Zhu Yunwen personally helped Xu Huizu to his feet, sighed, and said, “Have the Five Military Commandery prepare a list, submit it to the Grand Secretariat for approval, and have the Ministry of Revenue allocate funds and provisions to bring back those who have been banished and properly settle them in the capital.”
“Your Majesty!”
Xu Huizu was deeply moved.
Take Fu Youde, the Duke of Yingguo, for example, not only did Zhu Yuanzhang force him to kill his two sons, he even witnessed Fu Youde’s suicide. Zhu Yuanzhang didn’t spare Fu Youde’s family either, banishing them to places like Liaodong and Yunnan.
Although Zhu Yunwen had previously issued an edict to rectify wrongful convictions when it came to important figures involved in certain “major cases” and “ironclad cases,” no one dared to touch them. Only some peripheral grievances were addressed, with lighter implications.
Now that Zhu Yunwen personally spoke on the matter, although the grievances of the deceased loyal ministers involved in major cases like the “Lan Yu Case” were yet to be rectified, at least their families could return to normal life and no longer suffer in the wilderness.
Zhu Yunwen sat back down and said, “Minister Xu is right. National Day cannot be an intangible concept where people rejoice without knowing the reason or for whom they are celebrating. This is inappropriate. Minister Chen, you shall order the Imperial Academy to compile a biography of Emperor Taizu, starting from his birth and ending with the establishment of the Great Ming. Chronicle the heroes of our Great Ming and spread their stories throughout the land.”
“In compiling this book, I have only two requirements: it must be truthful and accessible. It should be written in a way that literate people can understand and illiterate people can comprehend.”
“I shall comply with your orders!”
Chen Di gladly accepted the command.
Xu Huizu was filled with gratitude. With this, their ancestors who shed blood on the battlefield would not be in vain, and their heroic legacy would be remembered.
Emperor Zhu Yunjun picked up a tea bowl, looked at the mark on it, and suddenly asked, “What is our Great Ming’s national flag?”
“National flag?”
Xie Jin, Xu Huizu, and Chen Di were taken aback.
“Your Majesty, the military flags in the army, we are aware of them. But what is a national flag?”
Xu Huizu cautiously asked.
“And what about the national emblem and national anthem?”
“Um, may I ask, Your Majesty, what is a national emblem and what is a national anthem?”
Even the knowledgeable Xie Jin was perplexed.
Zhu Yunwen felt quite frustrated. The Great Ming Empire, and yet there were no three essential elements of a nation: a national flag, a national emblem, and a national anthem. It was as if they just set up a tent, shouted “Long live,” and called it the establishment of the Great Ming Empire.
Wasn’t it too hasty!

Chapter 47: The Need for a National Flag, National Emblem, and National Anthem
Without a national flag, how can we proclaim to all directions that this is the territory of Great Ming and we are the citizens of Great Ming?
Without a national emblem, how can we dignify and solemnize the spirit of Great Ming, displaying the grandeur and majesty of Great Ming?
Without a national anthem, how can we unite and forge a common bond, gathering the hearts of millions, inspiring a sense of pride, and expressing our patriotic aspirations?
Zhu Yunwen introduced the national flag, national emblem, and national anthem to Xie Jin and others. In short, they represent the common flag, emblem, and song of the citizens of Great Ming.
As long as one is a citizen of Great Ming, regardless of their location, when they see the national flag, observe the national emblem, or hear the national anthem, they will instinctively resonate and feel a sense of belonging, loudly proclaiming:
“I am a citizen of Great Ming!”
“The national flag, national emblem, and national anthem must be implemented this year. I entrust this matter to the Ministry of Rites. Is there any problem?” Zhu Yunwen said earnestly.
Chen Di’s face flushed with excitement as he replied confidently, “Your Majesty, this is a crucial matter for the foundation of Great Ming. The individuals involved in this task will be renowned throughout history. I suggest involving personnel from the Six Ministries, the Five Military Commanderies, and the Grand Secretariat.”
Xie Jin and Xu Huizu looked at Chen Di, filled with excitement.
This is a national affair that must not be missed. If their names were associated with the national flag, national emblem, and national anthem, even if Great Ming were to disappear in the distant future, their names would never be erased!
However, they would owe Chen Di an enormous favor for making this possible!
Zhu Yunwen smiled and agreed, saying, “Very well then. Let the Six Ministries, the Five Military Commanderies, and the Grand Secretariat each provide several sets of proposals for the national flag, national emblem, and national anthem. We will revise and discuss them together during the court meetings. How does that sound?”
“Excellent!” Xie Jin, Xu Huizu, and Chen Di exclaimed with enthusiasm.
Zhu Yunwen picked up his teacup, lightly tapped the teacup saucer, and continued, “In that case, I hereby order Minister Xie to draft an edict. From now on, the 4th day of the first lunar month shall be designated as the annual Great Ming National Day, an everlasting tradition. All official business and affairs can be suspended for seven consecutive days to celebrate together with the nation. Considering that New Year’s Day Holiday falls in the first lunar month, we will reschedule the court assembly to the 16th day of the first lunar month, right after the Lantern Festival. Additionally, during New Year’s Day and the National Day period, the curfew within the capital shall be lifted.”
“I shall comply with the order!” Xie Jin smiled and, without returning to the Grand Secretariat, proceeded to draft the imperial edict directly in the Wuying Hall. After Zhu Yunwen stamped it with his seal, the Office of Transmission announced the news. The people of the capital, upon hearing the announcement, cheered and rejoiced with great excitement.
The King of Zhongshan Mansion.
After returning home, Xu Huizu quickly ordered someone to bring Xu Yingxu, who was indulging outside, to discuss the matter of the national flag, national emblem, and national anthem. Upon hearing this, Xu Yingxu immediately understood the benefits involved.
Once it’s done, their names will be immortalized!
In this era, reputation matters the most!
Even a hundred years later, if the Xu family declines, their descendants can still proudly hold their heads high, as their ancestors were the ones who designed the national flag, national emblem, and national anthem of the Great Ming.
“But Big Brother, how should we design them?” Xu Yingxu asked uncertainly.
Xu Huizu frowned and said, “Aren’t you good at painting? Just draw them.”
Xu Yingxu picked up a brush and looked at Xu Huizu for a while but couldn’t bring himself to start. Finally, he put the brush down on the inkstone and sighed, “Brother, I’m skilled in landscape painting. The national flag can’t be a landscape, right? How about something like a war flag with the character ‘Zhu’ written inside a circle?”
Xu Huizu felt like he was going to vomit blood and gritted his teeth, “If it were that simple, I wouldn’t need you to think about it!”
Xu Yingxu also became anxious and exclaimed, “If it’s so complicated, then there’s no use in asking for my opinion…”
Xu Huizu was speechless. Yes, his younger brother wasn’t up to the task…
Forget it, it’s better to invite more people.
Song Sheng, the Deputy Commander of the Central Army Commandery, was both literary and martial. Li Yuan, the Deputy Commander of Yuzhou Guards, was also talented. Might as well invite all the esteemed figures from the Five Army Commanderies to gather together.
“You go and write the invitations, inviting the esteemed figures from the military to a banquet at our mansion this evening.”
Xu Huizu couldn’t rely on Xu Yingxu, so he had to mobilize the masses.
Inside the Grand Secretariat, Xie Jin sat by a small stove, sipping tea, and leisurely flipping through a book. He instructed his subordinates to deliver a message to Yu Xin and Zhang Dan, and they swiftly abandoned their families and hurried to the palace. Zhang Dan, without his usual limp, jumped out of bed and even skipped the sedan chair, running all the way to the Grand Secretariat.
“Oh, both Grand Secretaries didn’t stay at home to accompany your children and rest. How come you’ve come to the Grand Secretariat? Didn’t the news reach you? The Emperor has graciously allowed you to have an extra five days off,” Xie Jin said with a sly smile, enjoying his tea.
He had gained an advantage. This year, he was on duty in the Grand Secretariat, and next year it would be the turn of these two. Although they were taking time off, it seemed like they planned to spend New Year’s Day and National Day with him instead of going home.
“Why should I?!” Xie Jin protested.
When they were winning, these two fellows were full of themselves, but now that it was their turn to suffer a loss, they still wanted to cause trouble? Did they have no sense of honor and integrity as Grand Secretaries?
“We’ll discuss this matter later. Let’s talk about the national flag, national emblem, and national anthem. Should the three of us work together to complete them step by step, or should each of us take charge of one?” Yu Xin approached the fireplace, warming his hands, and said.
Xie Jin, hand the warmed wine to Yu Xin and Zhang Dan, he said, “With only our talents, it’s definitely not an easy task. You see, the proposals formed by the Grand Secretariat need to be compared with those of the Six Ministries and the Five Military Commandery. I believe that scholars from the Hanlin Academy should be involved.”
“Hehe, it’s rare to see Xie Dashen admitting that he’s not up to the task. I have no objection to involving scholars from the Hanlin Academy,” Zhang Dan said contentedly after taking a sip of warm wine.
Yu Xin smiled and said, “It’s a pity that we don’t know when that monk will return. I’ve heard that he is quite talented.”
Xie Jin nodded slightly and agreed, “If Yao Guangxiao can persuade the King of Yan to submit, it would be a great accomplishment. This man is courageous, strategic, and knowledgeable in many areas. He is a well-educated scholar and should not be excluded from the matters of the national flag, emblem, and anthem.”
Zhang Dan concurred, “You’re right. However, he is probably still in Beiping, and even if we send a letter now, it will take at least a month for him to return. I’m worried that the Six Ministries and the Five Military Commandery will beat us to it.”
Xie Jin let out a sigh, stood up, and said, “Based on my speculation, Yao Guangxiao should be on his way back to the capital by now. After all, if he stays in Beiping for too long, his Majesty will become suspicious, and it will be difficult for him to fulfill his ambitions.”
Upon hearing this, Yu Xin walked to the table, spread out a sheet of paper, and began drawing with a brush. He said, “We just need someone to deliver the message. If they encounter him on the way, they should urge him to hasten his return. If he is still in Beiping, I hope he can come back as soon as possible.”
Xie Jin and Zhang Dan nodded, watching Yu Xin draw patterns on the paper. The two of them stood by, pointing and giving suggestions, while Yu Xin made revisions. In the end, they still weren’t satisfied.
“The matter of the national flag, emblem, and anthem is not the work of one person or one day. Let’s have the recommended scholars from various regions come to the capital early,” Xie Jin proposed after discarding several sheets of paper.”

Chapter 48: The Consciousness of the Students at the Imperial Academy
The news of the imperial court’s preparation to establish a national flag, national emblem, and national anthem spread like wildfire, causing a sensation throughout the city of Nanjing.
In the Imperial Academy
Wu Yun from the Shuaixing Hall was flipping through “The Analects” in the study hall, trying to understand the meaning behind old man Zhu Xi’s annotations.
Although Wu Yun disagreed with Zhu Xi’s convoluted explanations, he had no choice but to adhere to Zhu Xi’s annotations as the examination outline for the imperial examination. If he wanted to express his own opinions and ideas freely, he would have to give up and return home.
Bang! Bang!
Wu Yun looked up and saw Hu Jun standing by the window, looking at him.
“Brother Wu, come out quickly, there’s a big matter,” Hu Jun quickly exclaimed.
Wu Yun pointed to the “The Analects” in his hands and said, “The Spring Examination is approaching, and we must not slack off in our diligence. It’s better not to disturb me with trivial matters.”
Hu Jun laughed and said, “You are already a student of the Shuaixing Hall. As long as you pass the assessment, you can be appointed to an official position. Why bother participating in the imperial examination? If you fail, wouldn’t it be a blow to your reputation?”
The Imperial Academy is divided into six halls, with three in the junior level: Zhengyi (Justice), Chongzhi (Aspiration), and Guangye (Wide Industry); two in the middle level: Xiudao (Cultivating the Tao) and Chengxin (Sincerity); and only one in the senior level: Shuaixing (Spontaneity).
Upon entering the Imperial Academy, passing the Four Books examination allows entry into the three junior halls.
After studying in the Imperial Academy for a year and a half or more, passing the exams, and demonstrating proficiency in literature, one can enter the middle-level halls.
In the middle-level halls, after studying for another year and a half or more and passing the assessments, demonstrating mastery of the classics and comprehensive knowledge in literature, one can enter the Shuaixing hall.
As a student of the Shuaixing Hall, there are monthly assessments. Excellent performance earns one point, passing earns half a point, and failing earns no points. If one earns eight points within a year, they can be appointed to an official position.
Wu Yun had joined the Shuaixing Hall three months ago and had excelled in every assessment. He no longer needed to participate in the imperial examination; he just had to wait for the opportunity. Enduring for eight months would allow him to enter the court or remain in the capital or be assigned to a local position.
Wu Yun smiled faintly, rolled up his book, and said, “Compared to reputation, I have greater ambition. I remember you have relatives in the capital. Why did you come to the Imperial Academy? Did you start teaching in advance?”
Hu Jun clapped his hands and quickly said, “Look at me, I almost forgot about this. Brother Wu, you still don’t know, the court has established a National Day, which falls on the fourth day of the first lunar month. It’s a day of national celebration, with days off that can be extended until after the Lantern Festival.”
“National Day? Haha, that’s novel. It’s a celebration of the founding of the country, not bad. During those four days, I’ll leave the Imperial Academy and take a stroll in the streets,” With a smile on his face, Wu Yun turned to the side and asked, “Your joy seems to be more than just about having a few days of rest, isn’t it?”
Hu Jun entered directly through the window, walked towards Wu Yun, pulled out a nearby stool, and said, “There is another major matter that I just heard. The imperial court intends to design a national flag, national emblem, and national anthem for the Great Ming, to proclaim the unity of the Great Ming and to inform all the nations and peoples.”
“National flag, national emblem, national anthem? What are these?” Wu Yun furrowed his brow, having never heard of them before.
Hu Jun chuckled and said, “That’s the problem right here. None of us knows what they are, but everyone hopes for their existence. Just imagine, raising the national flag of the Great Ming, gazing upon its national emblem, and singing the national anthem of the Great Ming. It will be such a magnificent and glorious sight!”
“Currently, the Grand Secretariat, the Five Military Commandery, and the Central Six Ministries are all busy, preparing proposals for the national flag, national emblem, and national anthem. This is a significant matter for the country. As students of the Imperial Academy and members of the  Shuaixing Hall, how can we not participate?”
Hu Jun’s speech also stirred up Wu Yun’s excitement. He put down his book, stood up, and said, “Did the Ministry of Rites ask our Imperial Academy to participate?”
“Oh, they didn’t, actually,” replied Hu Jun straightforwardly.
Wu Yun gritted his teeth and stared fiercely at Hu Jun, asking, “Then why are you telling me all this?”
Hu Jun laughed heartily and said, “Although the Ministry of Rites didn’t ask us, we can find a way to participate. Don’t tell me that you, Wu Yun, don’t want to be involved in such a historically renowned national affair?”
Naturally, Wu Yun didn’t want to miss such an opportunity and said straightforwardly, “Who doesn’t want to participate? But if the Ministry of Rites doesn’t give the order, what can we do?”
Hu Jun brought the teapot from the side and poured a cup of cold tea. With a smirk, he said, “Don’t forget, we have a person with extraordinary connection in our Imperial Academy. As long as she speaks up, our Imperial Academy’s participation won’t be a problem.”
“You mean her? You want us to ask her?” Wu Yun widened his eyes, looking incredulous.
Hu Jun nodded and said, “Wu Yun, you’ve also read ‘Cats Theory.’ If monks can stand in the court, why not women? Doesn’t ‘Recruit talents without sticking to conventions’ align with your beliefs? Or is it just empty words?”
“But what talent does she have?” Wu Yun exclaimed in frustration.
Hu Jun calmly looked at Wu Yun and said, “As far as I know, the individuals she recommended, such as Li Zhigang, Guo Lian, and Wang Huai, have performed exceptionally well and achieved good results in assessments. It doesn’t matter if she herself is talented or not. She is adept at discovering talent. Do you acknowledge that?”
Wu Yun pursed his lips and remained silent.
Someone who dares to test students’ courage with a python, causing a commotion in the Imperial Academy, is indeed talented.
Regardless of her unconventional methods, the results are legitimate.
Hu Jun grabbed Wu Yun’s arm and said, “The Chancellor and the Director of Studies are not here. If we want to participate, the only way is to have her intervene. I have arranged contact with over thirty people. Even if she doesn’t agree, the news will reach the Emperor. We still have a chance then.”
Wu Yun lowered his head solemnly and agreed.
King of Zhongshan Mansion.
Xu Miaojin was writing a letter to her elder sister, Xu Yihua, informing her of some interesting incidents at the Imperial Academy. Just as she finished sealing the letter, a servant came in and reported, “Young Miss, there is a group of Imperial Academy students outside seeking an audience.”
“The Imperial Academy?” Xu Miaojin quickly pushed the door open and asked, “Did they mention the purpose of their visit?”
“They only said it was an important matter to discuss,” the servant replied.
Xu Miaojin nodded and instructed, “Please have them wait in the front hall. I’ll be back shortly.”
Although it was the vacation period for the Imperial Academy, many students couldn’t return home and had to stay behind at the academy. Combined with Zhu Yunwen changing the examination schedule, many students remained at the Imperial Academy, diligently studying.
The Imperial Examinations have been held once in the 30th year of the Hongwu reign. According to the regulations, they should be held once every three years, and the next one should take place in the second year of the Jianwen reign.
However, Zhu Yunwen was unwilling to wait. Apart from releasing the “Cat Theory,” he advocated the principle of “promoting the capable and demoting the mediocre.” He forcefully advanced the imperial examinations by one year and urgently announced them throughout the country. He intended to replace the old with the new.
Naturally, there were voices of opposition to this move, but the top officials of the Grand Secretariat and the Six Ministries supported it. Whatever the subordinates said made no difference.
Xu Miaojin didn’t know what major issue these students had, but as the Proctor of the Disciplinary office in the Imperial Academy, she couldn’t turn a blind eye or ignore it.
Upon reaching the front hall, a group of students saw Xu Miaojin approaching. They quickly formed several queues, respectfully saluting and calling out, “We greet Proctor Xu.”
Xu Miaojin smiled, and the most pleasing thing to her was the title of “Proctor Xu.” She stepped forward and asked, “What brings all of you to my mansion? Is there something happening at the Imperial Academy?”
Hu Jun took a step forward, saluted once again, and said,
 “Proctor Xu, we, the students, are all willing to contribute to the prosperity of the Great Ming. We request your assistance, Proctor Xu, to elevate the Imperial Academy’s reputation for eternity and leave a legacy for future generations.”

Chapter 49: Mass participation, Empress advice with Example of Song Dynasty.
Kunning Palace.
Xu Miaojin looked at Zhu Yunwen, who was holding his child, and complained, “The students of the Imperial Academy are also scholars of Ming Dynasty. Why aren’t they allowed to participate?”
Zhu Yunwen, seeing that Zhu Wenkui had fallen asleep, handed the child to Ma Enhui beside him and whispered, “I thought you were oblivious to outside affairs and solely focused on studying the books of sages. If it weren’t for the students seeking you out, were you planning to enter the palace only during the Lantern Festival?”
Xu Miaojin felt for the first time that being kept in the dark about information was a distressing matter.
The students of Imperial Academy respected her, knowing that she had value, but the members of the Xu family didn’t see it that way.
Xu Huizu, as the top person in the Five Military Commandery, was in charge of the development of the national flag, national emblem, and national anthem. It was said that many noble and distinguished individuals had even come to visit, but no one informed her!
If it weren’t for the students seeking her out, she would still be in the dark.
“The students informed me, which means I can still hear about things outside. Besides, it’s just a one-day difference. Imperial Academy may not necessarily lag behind the Grand Secretariat, Five Military Commandery, and the Central Six Ministries.”
Xu Miaojin knew the value and significance of participating in the creation of the national flag, national emblem, and national anthem for Ming Dynasty. She also knew that this was a rare opportunity that wouldn’t come again. Regardless, she couldn’t give up.
Zhu Yunwen was also somewhat hesitant.
The immediate superior of Imperial Academy was the Ministry of Rites, but now the Ministry of Rites ignored Imperial Academy and joined forces with officials from the other five ministries. With the collective participation of the Six Ministries, in terms of numbers and influence, it was already saturated. The Ministry of Rites probably wouldn’t consider involving the students of Imperial Academy.
“Your Majesty, Your Majesty.”
Shuangxi rushed in, his footsteps light and full of excitement.
“Lower your voice!”
Ma Enhui glared fiercely at Shuangxi and lowered her head to look at the child, fortunately not waking him up.
Zhu Yunwen looked at Shuangxi and asked, “What’s the matter?”
Shuangxi had a big smile on his face, greeted them properly, and said, “Your Majesty, Your Majesty, there is great news. There is news from outside that people in the capital are gathering at Zhongzheng Street, Mafu Street, Big Street outside Xi’an Gate, West 18th Street, and other places to petition and participate in the three major national affairs. They are willing to contribute their humble efforts to the national flag, national emblem, and national anthem. Especially the textile shops, dyeing workshops, artisan workshops, uh, even the young ladies from Cuiyan Tower are planning to sing for the country…”
“Outrageous!”
Ma Enhui stomped her foot, her face icy cold, frightening Shuangxi into quickly kneeling down.
“The three major national affairs of the national flag, national emblem, and national anthem, how can prostitutes participate? If future generations were to find out, how would Ming Dynasty stand in the world? Wouldn’t we be utterly humiliated? These people deserve to be punished!”
Ma Enhui expressed her dissatisfaction.
Xu Miaojin nodded repeatedly, feeling that she didn’t even have a chance to participate, yet these people who sold their bodies wanted to get involved in national affairs?
Zhu Yunchuan comforted Ma Enhui and smiled, saying, “In my opinion, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Whether they are traders, farmers, or even prostitutes, if we strip away their identities, they are still subjects of Ming Dynasty. Although I have the final say in Ming Dynasty’s affairs, whether they can truly resonate with the people and gain their acceptance, that depends on the voices of the people of Ming Dynasty!”
“Since the common people support it and are willing to contribute, why should our royal family be concerned about their status? Let me tell you, when it comes to national affairs, it should involve the participation of all citizens. Shuangxi, inform Xie Jin, Xu Huizu, and Chen Di, and have them announce to the citizens of the capital, no, to all thirteen provinces of the country, all prefectures and counties. Let them come up with proposals, to be delivered to the capital by the three departments in September this year.”
“As for the final proposal, it will be decided by the court. The three departments from each region will participate in the discussion, striving to finalize the proposal in October and spread it throughout the country on next year’s National Day.”
Shuangxi hurriedly agreed and left.
“Your Majesty, wouldn’t this increase a lot of expenses?” Ma Enhui expressed concern.
Zhu Yunwen sat down with Ma Enhui, holding her gently, and said, “Expenses are a minor matter, but Empress should also understand that when the people participate, it can unite their hearts. The direction of their hearts is far more precious than gold and silver.”
“Brother Emperor, can our Imperial Academy also participate then?”
Xu Miaojin asked eagerly.
Zhu Yunwen nodded affirmatively and said, “Of course, Imperial Academy should naturally participate. However, younger sister Xu, if you still can’t find any issues with Imperial Academy after this matter, then forget about establishing a women’s academy.”
Xu Miaojin giggled and stood up, saying, “Why wait until October? This Proctor can complete it in February.”
“Haha, Empress, you see, Miaojin is indeed talented,” Zhu Yunwen laughed happily.
Ma Enhui nodded with a smile and praised, “Miaojin is truly extraordinary. I also hopes that Miaojin can contribute to the prosperity of Ming Dynasty.”
Xu Miaojin curtsied gracefully and said, “I swear to fulfill my mission without disgrace. Shall I take my leave now?”
Zhu Yunwen waved his hand and said, “Go ahead, you must not have the appetite to stay for a meal. Inform the students of Imperial Academy that I hope to see their achievements.”
“Thank you, Brother Emperor, Sister Empress. Miaojin is leaving.”
Xu Miaojin left the Kunning Palace with great joy.
Ma Enhui shook her head slightly, watching Zhu Yunwen pick up the book “The Eastern Capital: A Dream of Splendor,” and asked, “Your Majesty, are you interested in the former Song Dynasty? Are you contemplating the flaws of the former Song government?”
Zhu Yunwen flipped through the book “The Eastern Capital: A Dream of Splendor,” which recorded the flourishing scenes of the former Song Dynasty, and softly recited, “Empress, listen to this: ‘When the managers of wine shops saw a foot traveler visit their shops two or three times, they dared to lend them silver vessels weighing two or five hundred taels. Even when a poor family called for wine at the shop, they would also provide them with silver vessels.’ What do you think, Empress?”
Ma Enhui pondered and said, “The former Song Dynasty was indeed wealthy and prosperous, to the point where they would readily lend out silver vessels weighing two or five hundred taels. If this were to happen in our dynasty, it would be a rare sight. However, Your Majesty, although the former Song Dynasty was wealthy, the suffering of the common people went unnoticed. Based on the books I have read, such as the ‘History of Song,’ I discovered that in the over three hundred years of the Song Dynasty’s existence, the peasants revolted and rose up almost four hundred times, both large and small.”
“If Your Majesty seeks the wealth of the former Song Dynasty at the expense of the people’s well-being, then even if Ming Dynasty experiences a prosperous era, it will be a prosperous era for the royal and noble families, not a prosperous era for Ming Dynasty, nor for the people. I humbly implore Your Majesty not to exploit the people for wealth. The measures taken should be handled with utmost care and caution.”
Zhu Yunchuan set aside the book ” The Eastern Capital: A Dream of Splendor” and looked at Ma Enhui, saying earnestly, “If I can acquire wealth without harming the people, would Empress not oppose the lifting of the ban on merchants and provides constant advice on the matter.?”
Ma Enhui was startled and quickly knelt down, saying, “I have made a mistake, and I beg Your Majesty’s forgiveness.”
The rule was established by Zhu Yuanzhang that the harem should not involve themselves in politics.
Although Zhu Yunwen didn’t care about such restrictions and often discussed state affairs with Ma Enhui, she knew that harem interference in politics was a serious taboo.
However, whenever Zhu Yunwen needed her, she couldn’t refuse him, and she didn’t want to refuse. Again and again, she gradually developed the habit.
If Zhu Yunwen asked, she would participate and provide her opinions.
If Zhu Yunwen didn’t ask, she would focus on the harem and never bring up state affairs.
Zhu Yunwen sighed, approached and helped Ma Enhui up, saying, “I don’t blame you. Some things are unclear and hard to distinguish. You are the person closest to me. If I can’t persuade you, how can I persuade the officials?”
“It’s not easy to persuade me, Your Majesty.”
Ma Enhui still had lingering fear, but she insisted that lifting the ban on merchants was not feasible.
Zhu Yunwen smiled faintly, his eyes filled with a confident gaze, and said, “Not easy, you say? I don’t think so. Empress, how is the progress with the medical gauze? Let’s go and take a look, shall we?”
