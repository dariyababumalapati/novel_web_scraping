<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Seeing Baron Kate leaving indignantly, Hudson originally wanted to give him the wild geese he had hunted to comfort his wounded heart.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But thinking of the meaning of the number thirteen in the continent of Aslant, I finally gave up the idea of ​​seeking excitement.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can't do good things with bad intentions. People have finally agreed to something after a lot of effort. If you continue to provoke them, they might really go crazy.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was estimated that the hunting of geese just now was just a coincidence, but in the eyes of Baron Katelai, it was a deliberate "threat" created by him.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Heaven and earth swear to God, “Five arrows shot at thirteen geese, every arrow went through their heads”, is this something a normal person can shoot?</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even if Hudson was cheating, he still needed the cooperation of the geese. If the geese were not changing their formation and were caught by the arrow, there would be no such miracle.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, Hudson's pretense was so successful that Baron Kate was completely confused and he didn't even think about it as a coincidence.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only firing five arrows was not just for showing off; what was more important was that in order to achieve such a range, Hudson could only fire five arrows.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If there were more, his arm strength would be too much. Who made him just a weak rookie who had just touched the threshold of intermediate knight?</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With ordinary bow and arrow shooting, one can easily fire more than a hundred arrows; with the high-strength elven bow, under normal circumstances, one cannot even fully draw the bow, so there are naturally limitations in its use.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unless he lowers his shooting range and reduces his arm strength, his sustained output as a strong archer will be truly impressive.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hudson's transport brigade had not yet been formed, but the Second Infantry Regiment that entered Arbor County had already completed two rounds of dragnet searches in conjunction with local nobles, and was just short of turning the land over.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all the trouble, I spent more than half a month without seeing any trace of the Skull and Bones Society.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If it weren't for the evidence of Knight Florian and the bodies of fifty-seven soldiers, as well as the testimonies of a number of eyewitnesses, everyone would have doubted whether the news of the Skeleton Society's appearance was just a rumor.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As they couldn't find anyone for a long time, instead of relaxing, everyone became even more nervous.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The reason why cult organizations are so scary is that they hide in the dark. If their identities were exposed, they would be easier to deal with.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unfortunately, almost a month has passed since the incident, and still nothing has been found.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Perhaps the members of the Skull and Bones Society have already left Arbor County. These rats are best at hiding. According to past practice, they would flee thousands of miles away after each crime.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although we were not able to capture the Skeleton Lord this time, it was not a complete loss for everyone.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We successfully destroyed the dens of several cult organizations, including the Cult of the Evil God, the Cult of Chaos, the Church of Desire, etc. We also destroyed three smuggling salt gangs and arrested a total of 236 criminals of various types.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I believe that after this battle, the social order in Qiaomu County will be…” Listening to Baron Raphael’s summary of the results of the battle, Viscount Oran’s face was terribly gloomy. Most of these criminals were caught in Qiaomu City, and they just said that he, the city lord, was not good at governing the place.</font></font></p><div class="google-auto-placed ap_container" style="width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;"><ins data-ad-format="auto" class="adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1074058122108724" data-adsbygoogle-status="done" style="display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;" data-ad-status="unfilled"><div id="aswift_2_host" style="border: none; height: 0px; width: 979px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; background-color: transparent; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;"><iframe id="aswift_2" name="aswift_2" browsingtopics="true" style="left: 0px; position: absolute; top: 0px; border: 0px; width: 979px; height: 0px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" width="979" height="0" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" vspace="0" hspace="0" allowtransparency="true" scrolling="no" allow="attribution-reporting; run-ad-auction" src="https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?gdpr=1&amp;gdpr_consent=CQBSCsAQBSCsAEsACBENA7EoAP_gAEPgACY4INJB7C7FbSFCwH5zaLsAMAhHRsAAQoQAAASBAmABQAKQIAQCgkAQFASgBAACAAAAICZBIQIECAAACUAAQAAAAAAEAAAAAAAIIAAAgAEAAAAIAAACAAAAEAAIAAAAEAAAmAgAAIIACAAAhAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQOhQD2F2K2kKFkPCmQWYAQBCijYAAhQAAAAkCBIAAgAUgQAgFIIAgAIFAAAAAAAAAQEgCQAAQABAAAIACgAAAAAAIAAAAAAAQQAABAAIAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAQAAAAIAABEhCAAQQAEAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAABAAA&amp;addtl_consent=2~70.89.93.108.122.149.196.236.259.311.313.323.358.415.449.486.494.495.540.574.609.827.864.981.1029.1048.1051.1095.1097.1126.1205.1211.1276.1301.1365.1415.1423.1449.1514.1570.1577.1598.1651.1716.1735.1753.1765.1870.1878.1889.1958.2072.2253.2299.2357.2373.2415.2506.2526.2568.2571.2575.2624.2677~dv.&amp;client=ca-pub-1074058122108724&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=4097469958&amp;adf=826460285&amp;pi=t.aa~a.1781892510~i.41~rp.4&amp;w=979&amp;abgtt=3&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1669998607&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=1595115097&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=979x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fm.uuks.org%2Fb%2F57664%2F72080102.html&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=200&amp;rw=979&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;uach=WyJXaW5kb3dzIiwiIiwiIiwiIiwiIixudWxsLDAsbnVsbCwiIixudWxsLDBd&amp;dt=1720176235436&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=530&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20240702&amp;mjsv=m202406250101&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D4a1f195b6538c527%3AT%3D1720176204%3ART%3D1720176204%3AS%3DALNI_MYZV_w8UaVNNDRYFNCskpg2FcpWBg&amp;gpic=UID%3D00000e74a45744ba%3AT%3D1720176204%3ART%3D1720176204%3AS%3DALNI_MaBgNn0AUgh5ZIOnZA0TLpGxbmfPA&amp;eo_id_str=ID%3D7d18fdc065523fae%3AT%3D1720176204%3ART%3D1720176204%3AS%3DAA-AfjYt-Ap70BH56ZbcPYGVC0pr&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1019x280&amp;nras=3&amp;correlator=8718245956062&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=413870998.1720176235&amp;ga_sid=1720176235&amp;ga_hid=1828274189&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=120&amp;u_his=2&amp;u_h=864&amp;u_w=1536&amp;u_ah=864&amp;u_aw=1536&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_sd=1.25&amp;dmc=8&amp;adx=20&amp;ady=1657&amp;biw=1019&amp;bih=646&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=44759837%2C42532524%2C44798934%2C95334511%2C95334526%2C95334579%2C31084890%2C31084186%2C31078663%2C31078665%2C31078668%2C31078670&amp;oid=2&amp;pvsid=4361874521879945&amp;tmod=439098664&amp;uas=0&amp;nvt=2&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=9%2C9%2C9%2C9%2C1536%2C0%2C1051%2C846%2C1036%2C646&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=128&amp;bc=31&amp;bz=1.01&amp;td=1&amp;tdf=0&amp;psd=W251bGwsbnVsbCxudWxsLDFd&amp;nt=1&amp;ifi=3&amp;uci=a!3&amp;btvi=1&amp;fsb=1&amp;dtd=6" data-google-container-id="a!3" tabindex="0" title="Advertisement" aria-label="Advertisement" data-load-complete="true" data-google-query-id="CKDpguvbj4cDFV7LEQgdy9oJDw"></iframe></div></ins></div>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, the facts were before him, and he could not find any reason to refute them. Baron Raphael was sent by the Governor's Office to help, so he did not need to buy into his claims.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Baron Raphael is right. We have achieved a lot in this period. But these are just a bunch of small fry. They have nothing to do with our goal.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If we want to truly maintain long-term peace and stability, we must continue to work hard to wipe out the Skull and Bones Society in one fell swoop.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This evil cult has launched five rebellions since entering our Alpha Kingdom.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The previous few incidents are still far away from us and can be ignored for the time being, but the last rebellion in the counties of Wright and Whiteton was experienced by everyone personally.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I thought they would run away thousands of miles away immediately after their failure as usual, but now they appear again.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Does this mean that they have new plans in Qiaomu County or the Southeast Province?</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In short, if we don’t remove this cancer, our Southeast Province will have trouble sleeping and eating!”</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Viscount Oran said seriously.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is impossible to stop the search operation. Who knows if the Skull and Bones Society will make a comeback after everyone disbands the team?</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He would risk exposing his identity, it couldn't be just to kill Knight Florian, right?</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A knight, where did this card come from?</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The revenge for the murder of his father, the hatred for the abduction of his wife, or was it that Knight Florian dug up the ancestral grave of the Holy Leader of the Skull and Bones Society?</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They don't look alike at all!</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The deceased Knight Florian was not a very decent person, but at least he was not a vicious criminal, and he had a good reputation in the aristocratic circle.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Viscount Oran, the Governor has ordered martial law throughout the province and strictly checked all major transportation routes and docks. If the Skull and Bones Society members show up, they will be discovered immediately.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Especially the roads in and out of Arbor County were the focus of monitoring. If the people of the Skull and Bones Society were smart enough, they would not show up at this time.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps they have entered the northern province of Furen or the western province of Fengyun. This is beyond our jurisdiction and can only be dealt with by the Governor's Office sending a letter to the two provinces."</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Baron Raphael analyzed.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unlike the local nobles of Qiaomu County who can stay here forever, the Second Infantry Regiment still has its own tasks.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It's ok to come and help occasionally, but what about the port if we stay in Qiaomu County for a long time?</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After being transferred away for such a long time, wouldn’t it be embarrassing if the boss found out that the port could operate normally with or without them?</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The slogan of preventing the invasion of sea tribes has been shouted for countless years, but unfortunately, the port where the Second Infantry Regiment is stationed has not seen any trace of sea tribes for hundreds of years.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As for the invasion of sea tribe, there has been no invasion of sea tribe since the birth of Alpha Kingdom.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The coastal defense line that was once heavily armed has long been abandoned, and the only remaining task is to fight pirates.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But that is also the task of the navy. These landlubbers usually just maintain order in the port.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, there was nothing to maintain. The port where the Second Infantry Regiment was stationed was the fiefdom of the Dalton family, and they had the ability to govern it.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The reason they are being transferred here to handle the affairs of Qiaomu County now, besides because they are the closest, the most important thing is that they have the least time.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The nobles in the province had long called for the disbanding of the Second Infantry Regiment. After all, no one wanted to share the military expenses and support a useless army.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As for the kingdom's coastal defense forces, they had already been deployed to the northern frontier one after another. The task of defending against the sea tribes was directly delegated to the major provinces.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Without the enemy's coastal defense, there is naturally no defense. It is said that in the deep sea now, various ethnic groups are holding PK friendly matches, and the fight is more intense than on the mainland.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Without waiting for a result, the probability of getting ashore is slim.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, we are not species from the same dimension, and the marine species that come ashore can easily become a delicacy on the human table.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">…</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Beda City, after receiving the message from his men, Earl Pierce spat out two words indifferently. "Good-for-nothing!"</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not being able to find any trace of the Skull and Bones Society is the second most important thing. At least we can capture a few important guys to make up the numbers!</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After making such a big fuss, he ended up catching a bunch of scumbags. How could this governor end up well?</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If it really doesn't work, catching the illegal salt dealers and digging deep to uncover the salt gangs behind the scenes is also acceptable.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Who doesn't know that the salt trade in the southeastern province is the Dalton family business?</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Daring to sell illegal salt clearly shows that he does not take the "King of Southeast" seriously.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is no doubt that the smooth operation of private salt trading must have been supported by local nobles, or at least tacitly approved.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is no way. Who made the profit from salt so huge?</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tens of thousands of salt cooks along the coast generate huge profits for the Dalton family every year, and it is the monopoly trade that stabilizes the profits from salt.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To be precise, there was no such thing as private salt in the Kingdom of Alpha at first, and the kingdom's laws did not stipulate who could sell salt.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, with the rise of the great nobles, they gradually monopolized the kingdom's salt trade. Everyone reached an agreement with the kingdom to pay a certain amount of financial resources every year in exchange for the salt monopoly of a certain place.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, these are just unspoken rules and have not been put into legal documents. Basically, whoever has the bigger fist will make the deal.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Once a big family falls into decline, these interests will also be transferred. Whether or not you can keep these interests depends entirely on your own strength.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It's too late now. Those who dare to sell illegal salt may not be very strong, but they must have a good nose.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is a basic operation to flee immediately when you sense danger. If you are a step slower, the nobles who originally supported them secretly will often be the first to raise their butcher knives to attack them.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Tell the Second Infantry Regiment to continue hunting down the Skull and Bones Society. If they can't catch anyone, they shouldn't come back."</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Earl Pierce said coldly.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was not just a vent of anger, but more of a political need for him to make a gesture. The news that the Skull and Bones Society had appeared in Qiaomu County had spread, and a letter for help had already entered the Governor's Mansion.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the Governor's Office did not take action, and there were subsequent changes in the local area, or a repeat of the events in the counties of Wright and Wyton, Earl Pierce would not be able to prevent it.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The kingdom could not tolerate an incompetent governor, and the nobles of the southeastern province could not tolerate an irresponsible governor.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even though the Dalton family is powerful, it doesn't mean that the governor cannot be replaced. If it really comes to that, the first to request a change will most likely be the Dalton family.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If he takes the initiative, he can also take the position of successor governor. It is better to cook the meat in his own pot than to have the kingdom send someone over.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">…</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the Mountain Territory, after more than twenty days of overtime work and by moving other undelivered orders from all over the place, Hudson finally got all the goods together.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The messy stuff together filled up forty carriages. In addition to weapons and equipment, there were also a lot of pots and pans.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the contrary, we didn't bring much food with us. Apart from some necessary dry food, we had to eat the rest as we walked.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hudson was very relieved in this regard. With his reputation as the "Knight of the Divine Bow", he would not have to worry about not being able to buy food on the road.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you are a little thick-skinned and eat for free along the way, you can transport the goods.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Looking at Hudson's lineup, Knight Adrian was horrified and said:</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Hudson, you're only going to take a hundred soldiers with you?"</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everyone's faces were not looking very good. The reason why they dared to accept the order at this time was because they relied on the elite troops in Hudson's hands.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It has to be said that Hudson was quite cunning. The knights he invited to escort him were not only poor, but also did not have any comrades from the Fifth Army.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everyone only heard about his brilliant achievements, and had no idea how much truth there was in them. As a result, everyone's confidence in him was a hundred times stronger than his own.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Don't we have you guys? Just forty truckloads of goods, four hundred men are more than enough."</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hudson said calmly.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If it was just for transporting goods, this configuration would definitely be high-end. On average, ten people would have one car, and it could be pushed all the way to Arbor County.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But now that the traces of the Skull and Bones Society have been discovered, everyone's confidence is not so strong. Especially since it is said that the one who killed Knight Florian was a golden knight, which makes everyone even more uncertain.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are high-level knights, evil god priests, and various evil summoning techniques. Once the fight starts, you can imagine how tragic the scene will be.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Respected Baron Hudson, I beg you not to joke around like this and take your main force with you!"</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Adrian said unhappily.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Deep down in his heart, he couldn't help but complain secretly: We are all family, don't betray your brothers like this. If something unexpected happens, it will be a tragedy.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Giving everyone a reassuring look, Hudson smiled calmly and said, "You worry too much! Things are not as bad as you think. As long as our luck is not too bad, we should be able to go smoothly.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Skull and Bones Society did show up in Arbor County, but that was a month ago. The Governor's Office has sent an infantry regiment to assist the local nobles and arrest the remnants of the Skull and Bones Society.</font></font></p><div class="google-auto-placed ap_container" style="width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;"><ins data-ad-format="auto" class="adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1074058122108724" data-adsbygoogle-status="done" style="display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;" data-ad-status="unfilled"><div id="aswift_3_host" style="border: none; height: 0px; width: 979px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; background-color: transparent; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;"><iframe id="aswift_3" name="aswift_3" browsingtopics="true" style="left: 0px; position: absolute; top: 0px; border: 0px; width: 979px; height: 0px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" width="979" height="0" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" vspace="0" hspace="0" allowtransparency="true" scrolling="no" allow="attribution-reporting; run-ad-auction" src="https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?gdpr=1&amp;gdpr_consent=CQBSCsAQBSCsAEsACBENA7EoAP_gAEPgACY4INJB7C7FbSFCwH5zaLsAMAhHRsAAQoQAAASBAmABQAKQIAQCgkAQFASgBAACAAAAICZBIQIECAAACUAAQAAAAAAEAAAAAAAIIAAAgAEAAAAIAAACAAAAEAAIAAAAEAAAmAgAAIIACAAAhAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQOhQD2F2K2kKFkPCmQWYAQBCijYAAhQAAAAkCBIAAgAUgQAgFIIAgAIFAAAAAAAAAQEgCQAAQABAAAIACgAAAAAAIAAAAAAAQQAABAAIAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAQAAAAIAABEhCAAQQAEAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAABAAA&amp;addtl_consent=2~70.89.93.108.122.149.196.236.259.311.313.323.358.415.449.486.494.495.540.574.609.827.864.981.1029.1048.1051.1095.1097.1126.1205.1211.1276.1301.1365.1415.1423.1449.1514.1570.1577.1598.1651.1716.1735.1753.1765.1870.1878.1889.1958.2072.2253.2299.2357.2373.2415.2506.2526.2568.2571.2575.2624.2677~dv.&amp;client=ca-pub-1074058122108724&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=4097469958&amp;adf=4212945274&amp;pi=t.aa~a.1781892510~i.195~rp.4&amp;w=979&amp;abgtt=3&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1669998607&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=1595115097&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=979x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fm.uuks.org%2Fb%2F57664%2F72080102.html&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=200&amp;rw=979&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;uach=WyJXaW5kb3dzIiwiIiwiIiwiIiwiIixudWxsLDAsbnVsbCwiIixudWxsLDBd&amp;dt=1720176235439&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=532&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20240702&amp;mjsv=m202406250101&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D4a1f195b6538c527%3AT%3D1720176204%3ART%3D1720176204%3AS%3DALNI_MYZV_w8UaVNNDRYFNCskpg2FcpWBg&amp;gpic=UID%3D00000e74a45744ba%3AT%3D1720176204%3ART%3D1720176204%3AS%3DALNI_MaBgNn0AUgh5ZIOnZA0TLpGxbmfPA&amp;eo_id_str=ID%3D7d18fdc065523fae%3AT%3D1720176204%3ART%3D1720176204%3AS%3DAA-AfjYt-Ap70BH56ZbcPYGVC0pr&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1019x280%2C979x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=8718245956062&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;tl=en&amp;ga_vid=413870998.1720176235&amp;ga_sid=1720176235&amp;ga_hid=1828274189&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=120&amp;u_his=2&amp;u_h=864&amp;u_w=1536&amp;u_ah=864&amp;u_aw=1536&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_sd=1.25&amp;dmc=8&amp;adx=20&amp;ady=7687&amp;biw=1019&amp;bih=646&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=6092&amp;eid=44759837%2C42532524%2C44798934%2C95334511%2C95334526%2C95334579%2C31084890%2C31084186%2C31078663%2C31078665%2C31078668%2C31078670&amp;oid=2&amp;pvsid=4361874521879945&amp;tmod=439098664&amp;uas=0&amp;nvt=2&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=9%2C9%2C9%2C9%2C1536%2C0%2C1051%2C846%2C1036%2C646&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=128&amp;bc=31&amp;bz=1.01&amp;td=1&amp;tdf=0&amp;psd=W251bGwsbnVsbCxudWxsLDFd&amp;nt=1&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;dtd=31854" data-google-container-id="a!4" tabindex="0" title="Advertisement" aria-label="Advertisement" data-load-complete="true" data-google-query-id="CP_im_rbj4cDFRYFvwQdjrQIEg"></iframe></div></ins></div>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No matter how inefficient they were, they had cleaned up Arbor County. It was unknown whether those rats who had been hiding in the dark corners were still alive.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The nobles along the way also stepped up their vigilance, and set up checkpoints on all major traffic routes, waiting for the Skull and Bones Society to arrive.</font></font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are leading the convoy forward. We will not take shortcuts or take small roads. We are all family members along the way. What is there to be afraid of?</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even if the Skeleton Lord really came, he would have avoided us. Could it be that the remaining three or five of their followers could rob our convoy?"</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was easy to say, but in fact Hudson was betting that the Skull and Bones Society would look down on his team.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although weapons and equipment are good, they need people to use them. The most important thing for the Skull and Bones Society now is hiding. Even if they robbed the convoy, they couldn't go on the road with such a big target.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Acting rashly would only increase the chances of them being exposed and attract more hunting forces.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The crowd, who could not find sufficient reasons to refute, were reluctantly persuaded by Hudson. Now that they were here, they couldn't just go home because they were afraid of the risks, right?</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This kind of thing is not what a knight should do.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What's more, everyone needs the money, so there is no reason to withdraw.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Seeing that people's hearts were barely willing to cooperate, Hudson was too lazy to continue talking nonsense and simply waved his hand to announce his departure.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Giving timely assistance is much more valuable than adding icing on the cake.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">While the nobles of Qiaomu County have not yet recovered from their fear of the Skull and Bones Society, sending the goods over first can earn you a lot of favors.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When the time comes and the risk has been completely passed, it is just a business.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">…</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The convoy moved forward slowly, and the biting cold wind hit everyone's faces, telling of the arrival of winter.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Winter in the south is a magical attack, and traveling in this season is really not a good choice.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fortunately, the people accompanying them were all elite soldiers from various families, and they were not treated harshly. They were wrapped tightly from head to toe to withstand the biting cold wind.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The speed of 60 miles a day was slower than Hudson expected. The main reason was that the roads along the way were too bad, which slowed down the speed of the convoy.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At this time, the benefits of having extensive social connections were reflected. By sending someone to inform them in advance, the nobles along the way would prepare what they needed.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hot water, hot meals, hot dishes... everything is available. Basically, you can eat and stay along the way.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since they were all friends, money was not an option. However, the sensible Hudson had prepared many generous gifts early on. Basically, he gave gifts as he went, so that the host would not suffer any loss.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unfortunately, in a hurry to get on the road, he had to decline the welcome banquets held by the nobles along the way, and missed the opportunity to further exchange feelings and expand his circle.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, there is no need to rush for this kind of thing. If you are willing to make friends, you can always find opportunities.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The proper arrangements made the knights, who were originally a little nervous, completely put their minds at ease.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are our own people everywhere, so there is no reason to be afraid of the remnants of the Skull and Bones Society.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Soft power is also strength. The connections he demonstrated along the way made the knights look at Hudson differently.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Facts have proved that the famous "Divine Bow Knight" is not only a good fighter and has many relatives, but also has friends everywhere.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most direct impact was on the Knights of Coelho, Roman and Valov. The three good neighbors privately expressed to Hudson their willingness to attach themselves to them.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although there were signs of this before, they were just a prototype and had not been fully realized. What they saw and heard along the way undoubtedly made them determined.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The other knights also showed signs of moving closer, but due to the geographical location, they were unable to make up their minds.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The weaker the strength, the more it needs to work together. Before taking on this transportation business, Hudson had not felt the need in this regard.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, he was the local bully, and the strength of his neighbors was also average. He was lucky enough not to bully others, and he didn't worry about the threat of external enemies at all.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, as the transportation business developed, Hudson suddenly found that his nest was not so safe, otherwise he would not have been so shameless as to threaten Kate to come to the Baron to help watch the door.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This kind of thing can only happen once or twice, but it must not happen again and again. If the oppression lasts for a long time, there will be a day when it will backfire.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is unrealistic to significantly increase the strength of the territory in a short period of time, so Hudson has no choice but to turn his attention to the outside world.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With more friends, the road will be easier to walk; with more allies, you will be stronger in fighting.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, forming an alliance is something that requires comprehensive consideration. While enjoying the benefits brought by the alliance, one must also assume corresponding obligations.</font></font></p>
<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This kind of thing cannot be rushed, and we must constantly screen to select the most suitable allies to form a group with.</font></font></p>
