Volume 3 Chapter 32 New Technology_From City-State to Empire_UU Reading
"In addition, I brought back a few bags of wheat seeds from Tusim. You can distribute them and plant wheat as soon as possible! I'm afraid Nurnusis and his men are not familiar with farming yet. Picos, you have to guide them."

"Yes, my king." Picos agreed readily.

The sailors, including nurses, expressed their gratitude to Shiloh for his attentiveness.

"By the way, Nurnusis, do you know how to do carpentry?" Shiloh asked. "A little bit," Nurnusis replied. Although they could not build ships, they could still repair them, which was a skill that sailors had to master.

"Can you make plows and ox-drawn harnesses?" Shiloh asked further.

Nurnusis shook his head.

"I know how to build these things!" Misconon said.

"Very good! Then you can discuss together and select these things. Tell my weapons workshop supervisor directly what equipment needs to be made." Shilo said, pointing to the weapons workshop being built on the banks of the Addoseni River.

"My king, these cows are probably difficult to command!" Picos was still frightened by the ferocity of the black cows.

"It's okay, give them nose rings." Shiloh said without hesitation. This was a very common thing in the countryside of his previous life.

"Bull nose ring?" The citizens were full of doubts.

"Once the harness is ready, I will tell you how to make a bull nose ring." Shiloh said in a relaxed manner, but it made everyone feel mysterious.

"My king, before you came back, we saw your slaves digging the land in a strange way. I wonder why?" a citizen asked curiously.

"Oh, has it been dug?" Upon hearing this, Shiloh immediately walked towards the river bank.

Sigurd was cultivating the land with dozens of slaves. In a small plot of land, a series of ditches had been dug. In the center of the ditches were rectangular mud platforms: about one meter high, eleven meters wide, and seventy meters long. The part above the flat ground was filled with soil from the ditches.

When Sigurd saw Shiloh coming, he hurried forward and said, "Master, we have dug a part of it! Can you take a look and see if it is correct?"

Shiloh looked at the slave who was covered in mud and praised him immediately: "Very good! Much better than I thought!"

Sigurd was praised and a simple smile appeared on his honest face.

"My king, what is the purpose of your land being like this?" Picos asked the question that all citizens were wondering.

"Growing wheat!" Shiloh's answer made them even more confused: Is it just for the sake of looking good to grow wheat in this uneven land?

"This is a new method of growing wheat taught to me by the gods. It can greatly increase wheat yields!" Shiloh's words shocked everyone.

Shiloh walked quickly to the ditch and said, "Look, first we fill the ditch with river water, and then plant wheat on the platform. When it's hot during the day, the water from the ditch can flow into the platform at any time to keep the soil moist; at night, the temperature of the ditch water can protect the wheat from frost; when it rains a lot, the wheat platform is high, and the rainwater flows down and can be discharged in time through the ditch."

"In addition, the water in the canals can produce a lot of humus over time, which can improve the nutrients in the soil. We can also raise fish and frogs in the canals, which can not only prevent pests but also increase our food variety. Except for the labor required to dig canals, cultivate soil and plant wheat at the beginning, this land can be self-sustaining for the rest of the time and eventually harvest a high yield of wheat!"

Many people were moved after hearing what Xi Luo said. Some people were skeptical and asked, "My king, is the yield really that high?"

Shiloh said seriously: "Of course! I am ready to grow wheat in this way, you can choose voluntarily!" In fact, the "raised field" technology that Shiloh knew was not modern science and technology, but it has existed in this era. Its inventor was a farmer in the mountainous area of ​​​​Peru in South America across the Atlantic Ocean around 1000 BC. Later, it was gradually lost until 1989 when Peru re-experimented with this technology and found that its yield was much higher than that of using agricultural machinery and organic fertilizers. It was then gradually promoted. In fact, it is a self-circulating green agriculture.

"But, my king, there is so much water needed in the ditch. Do we have to go to the river to draw water one jar at a time?" Kallikretu asked.

Misconon immediately sneered, "It's easy. Just dig a ditch and bring the river water in." As soon as he finished speaking, he found that everyone was looking at him with strange eyes. He was stunned and said, "Am I wrong?"

Picos couldn't help laughing: "The terrain here is much higher than the Adrotheni River. I'm afraid that after we dig the ditch, the water will not flow here, but flow back to the river!"

Everyone laughed. Misconon scratched his head disapprovingly and said, "It seems that we can only pump water to irrigate the fields!"

"Of course not!" Shiloh interrupted everyone's laughter and said loudly: "We are going to bring the river water here, but not by the ditch, but by a mechanical device, its name is a waterwheel!"

…

Waterwheels were a primitive machine often seen in Shiloh's hometown in his previous life, and they were also a beautiful landscape in the southern countryside. But Shiloh didn't think that a waterwheel could be made with only the half-baked carpentry skills of Nurnusis's sailors. It required a skilled carpenter! That was why he and Picos hurried back to the tent, because Surmus had returned from Tarantum.

"Xi...my king, congratulations. I heard that you helped Tusim defeat those Lukelam people again!" When Sulms saw Shiloh coming in, he immediately congratulated him.

"Uncle Solmus, I have asked Timasus to collect your share of cattle and sheep!" Shiloh certainly knew what the real intention of the man in front of him was.

"Thank you so much!" Solms was so excited that the fat on his face almost squeezed out his eyes.

"Sulmus, tell us quickly, how is the mission to Tarantum going?!" Misconon asked excitedly.

"Don't be anxious, sit down first!" Sulmus kept everyone in suspense. After everyone was seated, he began to narrate: "My king, I arrived in Tarantum at noon yesterday and went to see Archon Greenos first. He knew that we were not only not destroyed by the Brutti, but also defeated the powerful enemy for the second time and gained a foothold in the mountains. He was very surprised at the time and even called it a "miracle". I said that this was a victory achieved under the leadership of our King Hero. He praised again and again, saying that King, you are the favorite of Poseidon, the god of the sea. As early as the Isthmus Games, he felt that you are different from ordinary people!"

Several people showed proud expressions, but Xi Luo urged impatiently: "And then?"

Sulmus said angrily: "After Greenos knew my request, he didn't dare to keep me in his house anymore, but took me directly to the council. The council held a meeting specifically for this purpose. I told them about Poseidia's current difficulties and asked them for help. They also asked me about Poseidia, Tusim, and Lukelam."

"They didn't question Poseidon's monarchy?" Picos suddenly interrupted. Sulmus glanced at Shiloh, who smiled calmly and said, "This is also a question I'm concerned about."

"Some people also asked why Poseidon had a king. I told them that there were too few citizens in Poseidon and the enemies were everywhere. In order to be able to deal with the attacks of the Brutti at any time, we needed a unified leadership. King Hilo defeated the Brutti miraculously twice, proving that he was the most suitable candidate." Sulmus said proudly, "Obviously, my words worked. They didn't ask any more questions about it, but talked more about the iron ore in Tusim, animal furs and trees in the mountains-"

"Do they agree to provide assistance to us, Poseidon?" asked Nurnusis.

"Well..." Sulms hesitated for a moment and said, "They didn't make a decision at that time. This morning, the Tarantum Council informed me that I must discuss the cooperation and assistance between the two city-states with you in person, King. So I came back."

"Talk to me? Where? When?" Shiloh asked with a little surprise.

"Hmm... Hmm..." Sulmus whispered a few words: "In the council of Tarantum."

"What!" Misconon jumped up upon hearing this and cursed, "Let our king go to their council to negotiate! Is this a negotiation? This is an insult! Tarantum doesn't even take us Poseidia seriously!! Sulmus, this is the result of your mission to Tarantum! You are so disappointing!"

"Then what do you want me to do? Let the people of Tarantum come to talk to us?! If I didn't know Greenos, Tarantum would not be interested in meeting us at all! Having such a result... is already very good..." Sulms retorted a little guiltily.

"We can't let our king take the risk himself. What if Tarantum covets our land and detains our king?" Nurnusis' reminder shocked everyone.

"No, Greenos has assured me that Tarantum will receive our king like it receives other city-state governors and guarantee his safety!" Sulmus explained anxiously.

"Is this the promise of Greenos and the guarantee of the Tarantum Council?" Nurnusis pressed further.

Solms was speechless for a moment.

"Okay! Okay!" Hilo stood up and said, "Nurnusis, don't embarrass Surmus anymore. In fact, you all overestimated Poseidon! Who can tell me how many people there are in Tarantum?"

Everyone looked at each other, only Sulms said: "I heard Greenos say once that there seemed to be about 6,000 households" (To be continued.
