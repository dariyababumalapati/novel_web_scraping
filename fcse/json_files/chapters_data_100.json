Although in Athens, some state slaves were responsible for managing archives and documents, they all acquired knowledge before becoming slaves. Almost all Greeks hoped that slaves would be stupid and ignorant so that they would be easier to manage. If Hilo and Timasus took the initiative to teach slaves knowledge, they would undoubtedly be outliers in the city of Athens.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Brother, you already know what Uncle Solmus and I discussed, right?\" Shiloh said.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"I heard my father say that this is just a way out, isn't it?\" Timasus didn't care much about it.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"No! Big brother!

Athens' hegemony has begun to decline. I don't want to encounter something like Sicily again!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Timasus was not as indifferent to the war as his father was.

First, one had to prove that he was a pure Athenian citizen, and secondly, that he had no bad moral and political discipline, had a doctor certify that he was in good health, and had more than two physical education teachers certify that he had a ten-month training record.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Because they had discussed it in advance, Shiloh was able to sign up smoothly.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The events he will participate in are: pentathlon and separate sprint and middle-distance running.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Boxing, wrestling, and fighting were too violent and bloody. If the Spartans wanted to retaliate against him, they could easily do something with these events, so for safety reasons, he gave them up. As for chariot racing, Hero's family did not have the conditions. He did not have a good horse or a good driver. As for armed running, wearing a helmet and holding an iron shield, running, when 20 or 30 people were competing at the same time, whether it was a collision or a fall, it would be very painful. Only the five sports and individual running races were relatively safe, and the winners would receive the most honors.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh's physical education teacher when he was young was not lying. Shiloh was very talented in sports. He won the championship in sprinting, wrestling, discus and javelin without even using some modern techniques. Only in long jump, it was obvious that the original owner of this body did not like this sport, and its competition method was very different from the modern one. He held dumbbells in both hands, ran a short distance to the accompaniment of music, then took off, threw the dumbbells, and landed. Shiloh always had a bad coordination with the dumbbells. When landing, he either pulled forward or leaned back, and could not land stably, so he could not get any results, but he won four out of the five events, and his results were enough to be selected for the delegation.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      On the field, he met Xenophon and Plato, who also signed up for five events. Xenophon won the long jump, while Plato was second only to Hero in the discus and javelin. In the wrestling final, Hero had to work very hard to beat him.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hiro didn't expect that Plato, a world-renowned scholar in later generations, would be so good at sports. In fact, Plato's original name was Aristolus, and the name Plato was given by his physical education teacher when he was a child. Because he was strong and broad-chested since childhood, the meaning of Plato is \"broad\".\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Even though they performed well, they still could not be selected for the delegation because according to the rules, each city-state could only send one person for each event. The events reported by Plato and Xenophon were both pentathlons. Since Hero had an absolute advantage, the other contestants in this event had to be eliminated.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Plato and Xenophon were not upset by the elimination, instead they sincerely wished Hero a victory in the Isthmian Games. Especially Xenophon, he even taught Hero the technique of long jump.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After the trials, the competition committee announced that the contestants must come to the stadium every day to receive training and receive intensive coaching from the most experienced contestants in Athens until the delegation sets out. Because from this point on, the contestants not only represent themselves, but also the city-state. The competition committee must ensure that each contestant is in the best competitive state to win honor for Athens.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh regretted it, because it meant that he could not do anything during the day except training. But now the list was confirmed and it was too late to regret.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      …\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Since you have signed up for the competition, you must take it seriously. This is Shiloh’s attitude.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The first day of training made Shiloh understand several things: First, he believed that this clumsy long jump method was written into the competition rules, which every athlete must abide by and cannot be changed. Second, the starting position of the race can be changed. At that time, the starting position was to lean forward with the arms stretched forward. This was because people thought that starting in this way would be more advantageous, and it was just a convention.

Since the first Olympic Games in Greece in 776 BC, it has been about 360 years, and hundreds of various games have been held. Sports have developed extremely well. As a coach of a city-state, he is the cornerstone of the city-state to cultivate excellent athletes. He must not only have rich competitive experience, but also have a high level of moral cultivation, medical care, nutrition and hygiene, training methods and psychology, so that he can be respected and relied on by citizens.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      While healing his wounds, Shiloh demonstrated new discus throwing techniques to Polias.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Polyas immediately began to experiment.

The council members were not amateurs in sports. In fact, Athenian citizens had to receive education from at least three teachers from their youth to adulthood. The first one taught arithmetic, because the Greeks were a commercial nation; the second one taught reading and writing, especially the ability to recite and memorize some chapters of \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\"; the third one taught sports to cultivate a healthy and strong body. When the formal course was over, a teenager should be able to be shaped into an adult citizen with a healthy physique and good qualities. Therefore, the council members immediately felt the value of these two strange postures.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      By the time they realized they should go and congratulate the young man who had brought all this about, Agosenos had already gotten there first.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Helo, Helo, I can no longer describe the impact you have given us time and time again!\" Agosenos hugged Helo tightly, then raised his arm and gestured to the surroundings: \"Everyone, perhaps you all already know him, but I would still like to introduce him again. The son of the hero Hepias! The survivor of the Sicily expedition! The man who repelled the Spartan envoys at the citizens' assembly! The man who demonstrated the will of God on the sports field! Helo, a young man of only eighteen years old, is the darling of the gods!!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Everyone came forward and hugged Shiloh to express their gratitude and respect for him.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Young man, do you really think that the person in your dream is God?!\" A gentle yet majestic voice sounded in the stadium.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"High Priest Glaucus!\" Following this call, everyone automatically made way for him and bowed respectfully to the newcomer.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The old man came to Shiloh, holding a cane, with silver hair and beard fluttering in front of his chest, but with a pair of eyes that were bright and deep beyond his age.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Answer me, young man, do you really think you have received guidance from God?\" The old man's voice became more majestic.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      At this point, Shiloh could no longer avoid the question.

It is said that a few sheep of this tribe were mistaken for their own sheep by the Nolantum people who were also grazing and were driven back to the city. The tribal leader was very angry and gathered other tribes of the Brutti to attack Tarantum. Tarantum also summoned the armies of the city-states in southern Italy, and the two sides fought a great battle on the banks of the Budano River.

Another tribe attacked Tusim, hoping to take advantage of its weakened strength to drive it off its position as the leader of the Brutti tribes. The two sides fought another war. As a result, Tusim was defeated and its leader died. His son succeeded him as the leader of the tribe. This new leader had studied in Tarantum when he was young, so as soon as he took the throne, he sent people to ask Tarantum for a truce and request assistance.

There are iron mines in the mountains near this village. The Tusim people developed by relying on iron mines. Now this village has been occupied by its enemies.\" Sulmus sighed regretfully. Iron ore! Greece is not rich in iron ore, so the price of iron ore in Greece is relatively high.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Now, the new leader of Tusim has retreated with his tribe to the south bank of the Adrothene River.\" Sulmus pointed to the circle on the south bank of the river and said, \"I have discussed with the envoy of Tusim many times. Finally, he brought back a document signed by the new leader of Tusim, the elders, and the priests. If we are willing to pay fifty talents and give them a batch of food and weapons first, they are willing to sell us land.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Fifty talents! That was almost all the liquid funds in Shiloh's family. But if you lose money, you can earn it again, but it's not so easy to buy land! Shiloh was a little tempted: \"Which land are the Tusim people going to sell us?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Here!\" Sulms pointed to the place where the two rivers meet on the map. \"This is the river valley.

They said their enemies were always there and they couldn't guarantee my safety.\" Sulmus felt guilty. In fact, the Tusim people had invited him to conduct a field survey and negotiate with their leader. But Sulmus was afraid and didn't dare to go: \"However, merchants from Tarantum used to go to Tusim to buy iron ore and they know more about the situation there. What they said is basically the same as what I learned from the merchants.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Yeah.\" Shiloh nodded. He didn't look at the slightly strange expression on Sulmus' face. He kept his eyes fixed on the map: \"Uncle, you said before that the Tusim people have learned to cultivate the land, so why don't they keep such good land for themselves! Anyway, they still have a lot of land, right?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"I think... I think...\" Sulmus didn't expect that Shiloh could see the problem at a glance: \"The merchant in Tarantum told me that other places on both sides of the Adrosene River are steep valleys. Only at the confluence of these rivers is the terrain flat and can be waded. It is the only way to connect the two mountain strongholds of Tusim.\" Sulmus saw that Shiloh's expression became solemn, and hurriedly said: \"However, I heard from the envoy that after the last battle, that tribe seemed to have suffered considerable losses, so they have not launched an attack on Tusim so far. So as long as we settle down there, we can use money to hire Greek mercenaries to help us defend our garrison. I think the Brutti have suffered a great loss in front of the Greek heavy infantry, so they dare not attack easily.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"The Tusim messenger said that?!

If we accept this proposal, we will be fools who will not only lose money but also lose our lives! Uncle Sulmus, you have been blinded by the land and have lost your shrewd mind!\" Shiloh's scolding made Sulmus' face turn red and white, and he was very embarrassed.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After Shiloh had vented his anger, he calmed down. Seeing that Sulmus looked embarrassed, he realized that what he had said was too harsh, and hurriedly said, \"Uncle, please forgive me for being too impulsive just now! After all, this matter is too important. It concerns our lives, so we must be very cautious!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Solmus hummed twice, and his expression improved slightly.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Xi Luo looked at the map again and asked, \"Did the Tarantum coalition forces attack the Brutti along the Budano River before?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"That should be the case.

Besides, with the current situation of the Tusim people, they will not be able to harass Tarantum in the next few years. And Tarantum only likes the seaside, not the mountains, so they will not take the initiative to attack Tusim?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"But the Tusim people don't believe it.\" Shiloh sneered, \"They want us to act as a shield, blocking both the enemy's attack and possible attacks from the Greeks in southern Italy. What a good idea!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The cunning of the Tusim people aroused Shiloh's arrogance. In fact, apart from the factors of war, the land that Tusim wanted to buy from Shiloh was actually a treasure land. The land was fertile and could be used to grow wheat; the river could be used to raise fish; the mountains and forests could be used for grazing, logging, and hunting; there were also iron mines nearby, and the price should be relatively cheap. Agriculture, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry, all available now!\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      This is not the main point. The important thing is that Tarantum is rich and not aggressive, and the Brutti have been greatly weakened. As long as he can overcome the current difficulties, he will not only be safe there, but also develop greatly. As long as Xilo is recognized by both Tarantum and the Brutti, then because of the location of this land, it will definitely become a distribution center for goods from both sides. And because the Tarantum people are extremely wealthy, Xilo can completely use it as a large consumer market.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Timathus was touched because Hero called him \"dear brother\" in public. Several slaves were very excited, especially Keniga and Kozura. They had only worked for Hero for a short time, and the young master said that he trusted them very much. You know, when a master says this to a slave, it means that he has become the master's confidant and has a great chance of becoming a free man.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      They stared at Shiloh with burning eyes, eagerly waiting for his next words.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"I'm going to leave Athens and take you to colonize Italy!\" After Hiro said this, except for a few people who were slightly surprised, everyone looked calm.

Because he didn't expect Hilo to let Keniga attend this meeting. He knew Keniga's ability, and it was not just about settling accounts, otherwise he would not have spent a lot of money to buy him. But he didn't expect that this Hebrew slave would turn to Hilo so quickly, and Hilo seemed to be ready to use him, which made Sulmus a little worried. He stood up and said, \"After Hilo came back from Sicily, out of concern for the war between Athens and Sparta, he entrusted me to go to other places in the Mediterranean to see if I could buy a piece of land and colonize and build a city myself.

Because the \"pentathlon\" competition was about to begin, it was a competition set up by the best athletes in Greece, and the Athenian who had already won two championships would start his new performance. The audience was eager to know whether this athlete who could match Hermes in speed also had an absolute advantage in strength. So they flocked to the Poseidon Stadium.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In the open-air courtyard, Hilo lived up to everyone's expectations.

The two finalists were actually quite tired, especially Agesilaos, who was not like Helo who had already won the championship, and Agis sent someone to tell him last night that he must defeat Helo in order to strike a blow to the arrogance of the Athenians. Therefore, he was under great psychological pressure.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The people did not hide their love for him, and he did not seem bored at all. Instead, he felt a sense of novelty and repeatedly reminded the guards not to be too rude to the people who came forward. This made the people like this kind and humble young man even more, and they rushed to approach him.

No one paid attention to whether there were any escapees at the time, and there was no word \"escape\" in the Spartan dictionary, so Agis didn't even think about it.

Who is betraying Athens? Is it me who is determined to contribute to Athens?

You should know that your guardian is Pericles. Since you came of age, you have been classified by them on my side, unless you devote yourself to their side. But you have been taken care of by Pericles since childhood and became an Athenian citizen because of him. Will you do that?!\" Although Alcibiades had little contact with Hilo, he obviously knew Hilo's past. He paused to give Hilo some time to think, and then said: \"King Agis promised me that he would help us restore the order of Athens and restore its former vitality! For you, joining Sparta will never worry about finding opponents. You can learn more fighting skills here.

Many people could not accept this reality for a while. However, Anidius and Pionidus, who had been prepared for this, gathered their followers and took the lead in the attack. They produced irrefutable evidence and proposed to execute these deserters to comfort the warriors who died in Sicily and to warn against similar situations in future wars.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Although Agesenos was also hit hard by the bad news, he had to defend Hero at this moment. Because of his activeness some time ago, people thought that Hero had joined his faction. If he ignored it, it might make others feel disappointed. Moreover, Anytus' proposal had many loopholes that could be countered.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      So he was the first to stand up and express his opposition: \"I remember how long it had been since Athens implemented the death penalty after the Pisistratus family was expelled from Athens?! Citizens, it was forty years! In these four years, everyone worked together to achieve the prosperity of Athens today! And today Anis told us that he wants to implement the death penalty! He is going to take the lives of forty-seven citizens! Forty-seven people, not even that many people were exiled by Athens in ten years!

Some people even joined the team of the families of the dead soldiers in front of the council hall because they were deceived and demanded justice.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In the morning, there was an endless stream of people coming to visit Shiloh and his comrades in the yard. Some came to comfort their relatives, some came to visit their friends, some came to verify the truth of the incident from Shiloh, and some came simply to curse. Shiloh and his comrades treated all of them calmly, neither talking back nor fighting back. Under Shiloh's repeated instructions, they used this method to prevent the situation from escalating.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      From the visitors, Shiloh also learned about the dangerous situation they were about to face.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      He never expected that after the secret settlement was reached, Anidus and Pionidus would still keep targeting him and even call for the death penalty against them, which made him furious.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Since you are unkind, don't blame me for being unjust! Hero immediately gave instructions to Supete who came to visit him. Soon, the news that Anidus and Pionidos had sent the foreign merchant Gorikanon to seize Hero's property spread all over the streets and alleys of Athens.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      As things had become complicated, Agosenos had not shown up, and the proposal of the death penalty made Hero feel a crisis. Just as he and his comrades were pondering and discussing how to deal with tomorrow's public trial, a group of people broke into the yard.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Teacher!\" Hero and Timasus shouted respectfully.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"What does it feel like to fall from the peak of Mount Olympus to the ground?\" Socrates asked as soon as they met.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hiro was stunned for a moment, then he understood what he meant: \"When prosperity reaches its peak, it will decline.

It was so quick from hope to disappointment, no wonder they hated you so much. But if you really hadn't been a deserter, there wouldn't have been so many exciting things later...

Every year, Athens had to select 6,000 citizens over the age of 30 to serve as jurors of the People's Court. Usually, these 6,000 people were divided into ten groups, with 600 people in each group responsible for the work of a court. These ten courts were presided over by ten generals and their legislative secretaries (in the early days, they were presided over by nine archons, and later the \"Ten Generals System\" gradually replaced the archons). The number of jurors increased according to the size of the case. The maximum number of jurors for general civil or criminal cases was 500 plus one, but when hearing major cases, it was a multiple of 500 plus one.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The decision reached by the council was a universal trial, so the number of jurors was six thousand plus one, a number close to the number of all citizens of Athens, so it was called a \"universal trial.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Therefore, when the court opened in the morning, a long queue formed outside the door of the People's Court.

Would such a large team be allowed to enter Tarantum? Although the people sent back by Sulmus reported that a governor of Tarantum was willing to help, how much help would this provide? In addition, even if they could land smoothly, how could they guarantee that the slaves would not escape before reaching Tusim? ... A series of questions troubled Hero.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Look!

Otherwise, our escape from Sicily and your participation in the Isthmus Games would not be so smooth. You are the favorite of the sea god, that's for sure!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh smiled but didn't answer. He pointed to the mast and said, \"Should we change our course?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The crew had no objection to continuing the voyage, and were extremely excited. The blessing of the \"Poseidon\" made them excited, and they quickly raised the sails, took advantage of the strong southeast wind, and accompanied by dolphins, crossed the Ionian Sea overnight.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      When they were about to enter the bay, the dolphins returned to the deep sea under the reluctant gaze of the sailors, which made everyone more convinced that their journey to Italy was God's will.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In ancient times, the largest ethnic group in the Apennine Peninsula was the Sicilians, who, led by King Italus, occupied most of the central and southern parts of the Apennine Peninsula. Therefore, the name Italy comes from the name of this king.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Tarantum was built around 700 BC by the illegitimate sons of the Spartans. It must be said that these illegitimate sons had a unique vision. They occupied the best place in southern Italy. Not only was the land fertile, but it also had an excellent seaport. In just over a hundred years, Tarantum became the richest city-state in southern Italy.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Before Hero's fleet entered the port, it was surrounded by Tarantum's patrol warships. When Hero asked the Tarantum officer who came aboard to inspect the ship to see their archon Grinus, the officer, although notified in advance, still ordered the fleet to dock at a small island outside the port and be under strict supervision. Hero dismissed the Athenian ship owners who escorted them, and then boarded the patrol ship alone and entered the port of Tarantum.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      It should be said that the port of Tarantum is better than the port of Piraeus in Athens. It is located in a semicircular port (the sole of the Italian boot), which is naturally less exposed to wind and waves, and it is like a gourd. There is a small island in the center of the entrance, which serves as a barrier for the port and also as a naval base. The inside is divided into two ports, the inner and outer ports. A dam is built at the entrance of the inner port, and there are two water gates. The distance between the entrance and the exit is only about three ships parallel.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      There are many ships in the harbor, which shows the prosperity of Tarantum's maritime trade. But politically, it does not have the influence of Athens. In terms of strength, it is actually the strongest among the states in southern Italy, but this city-state founded by the descendants of Sparta is far from being as domineering as Sparta. At most, it unites with other city-states to fight against the barbaric tribes in the mountains, and even the troops sent are mostly hired.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh couldn't help but wonder if it was his illegitimate status that made the founder of Tarantum give up on himself and think that he would be content with a small fortune. Thinking of what happened to Tarantum in history, Shiloh felt that an old Chinese saying was right: \"Born in adversity, born in comfort!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

Once the slaves get benefits, they will want to get greater benefits and kill more enemies! If this continues, Shilo will cultivate a terrible war monster!\" Nurnusis' words made everyone feel cold. Looking at Shilo who was speaking to the slaves, they felt a sense of fear.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After a while, Miskonon laughed dryly and said, \"Nurnusis, don't scare us so that you can benefit alone. Shiloh donated his ship, why did you donate your ship as well? Isn't it to please Shiloh so that you can get more and more fertile land!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"I would like to ask for more land, but the agreement clearly states that each of us will have two acres of land.

After a few years, I will become a rich businessman and go back to Athens to show those who humiliated me.

No one around laughed at him, because everyone had the same experience and similar ideas.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Timasus came over and said, \"Helo lets you pass!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hero divided more than 140 slaves into teams of ten, and asked a heavy infantryman and a sailor from Nurnusius to be in charge of the training. He distributed weapons on the spot, which he had asked the weapon workshop to rush to make before participating in the Isthmus Games, and he spent a huge sum of five talents on this. Even the sailors from Nurnusius who only used bows and arrows were given spears, iron shields and leather armor. This made these people, who were once citizens of Athens, grateful for Hero's generosity and fully assist Hero in training slaves.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In fact, the content is very simple: let each team line up, hold shields and march, and keep stabbing with spears during the march. The purpose is to make these slaves who have just thrown away the oars get used to using shields and spears and understand the importance of queues. This requires repeated practice and a large amount of exercise to make these slaves have the initial consciousness of warriors in just a few days. Therefore, the training is extremely boring and arduous.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      However, the slaves were full of strong desire to improve their lives and gain freedom, and the novelty of having just obtained weapons made them train desperately instead of complaining. The former citizens of Athens had experienced the disastrous defeat in Sicily and knew the cruelty of war, so they also trained the slaves very seriously.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In a moment, the whole place was filled with dust and smoke, and shouts were deafening.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh watched all this with satisfaction, but Anchialou behind him was unhappy: \"Master... we also want to train... we also want to fight!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Xi Luo smiled: \"How can I miss you?

Because the battle axe soldiers are brave, but because the battle axe is too heavy, the power is lost too quickly. When they can't swing the weapon, and the enemy does not retreat, then they will become fish on the chopping board, at the mercy of others.

He got angry when talking about buying land. The Hebrew named Keniga was too good at bargaining. If it weren't for Dorisa's insistence, the deal would have been aborted long ago.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"As for the money, they are responsible for it.

The chief of the most powerful clan served as the leader of Tusim, while the chiefs of the other three clans served as elders. Together with the priests of the tribe, all matters of the tribe were decided by these five people. After the defeat of the Tarantum coalition, a neighboring tribe, Lukeram, immediately challenged it. During the battle, a clan of Tusim suddenly rebelled, resulting in Tusim's defeat and the death of the chief. Since the clan of the original chief was still the strongest, the new chief was the son of the original chief. Lukeram continued to advance, and Tusim was defeated twice in a row and had to retreat to the south bank. Although it now has a population of nearly 3,000, too many strong men died in the battle, so it can only send out a team of about 400 at most, while Lukeram's soldiers may reach more than 1,000. \"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      More than a thousand people!

I think the more important thing is that they coveted the iron ore in Tusim, so Lukeram did not dare to attack again, but moved the entire tribe to the main village of Tusim to consolidate their achievements. However, they seem to be active again recently!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"No wonder the Tusim messenger urged us to go quickly!\" Shiloh muttered to himself, and then asked, \"What's the situation at the Adrosene River?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"My dear master, the area where the Adrosene River can be waded is indeed on the land you purchased.\" Kozula picked up a dry branch and began to gesture on the grass: \"The width of the river here is about twelve steps, and the water depth reaches my thigh at most.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh let Kozula walk a few steps, and he understood: This river is about five or six meters wide, it is a small river!

It turned out that the eight slaves did not run away separately as Cecito had analyzed. They agreed to escape into the forest together, but they ran into a small group of Brutti. They wanted to explain to the Brutti that they had no ill intentions, but they were met with the Brutti's javelins. Two of them were shot dead on the spot, and two were shot and wounded. They were so scared that they fled back, and only four escaped the pursuit of the Brutti. They did not dare to return to the camp for fear of being punished, so they sneaked into Tarantum. Unexpectedly, a citizen found that they looked panicked and were dressed as slaves, so he secretly called the city guards and arrested them on the spot.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      They lied that they were free men, but they had slave marks on their bodies and could not produce proof of being free men, and they would not reveal who their masters were. So the city guards escorted them to the square and whipped them in public to serve as a warning to others. You know, in any Greek city-state, it is a serious crime for a slave to escape. If Solmus had not arrived in time, they would have been beaten to death on the spot.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      For this reason, the Tarantum Council even sent people to warn Shiloh that if something similar happened again, Tarantum would end its agreement with him and drive them out of Tarantum's land ahead of time.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      When Shiloh saw them covered in blood, he was overjoyed. He immediately took them to the training ground. After gathering all the slaves, he asked these slaves to tell their experiences in public. While the slaves felt sad for their tragic experiences, they were secretly glad that they did not escape with them, otherwise they would have suffered the same fate.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Then, Shiloh announced that he should have severely punished the escaped slaves, but he valued the lives of every slave and decided to find a doctor to cure them first. He would punish them after their injuries were healed.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      This move touched the hearts of the slaves. Since they would be shot by the natives if they fled to the mountains, and beaten if they fled to the city, it would be better to work under this kind master, at least they could become free people one day.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      At dusk, Picos asked Hero to take back the weapons to prevent the slaves from making trouble at night. After thinking about it, Hero refused his request and said to the slaves: \"You are my soldiers now and should have the dignity of a soldier. I allow you to continue to have weapons and be familiar with them at any time, just like being familiar with your own hands and feet, but can I trust you?\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The slaves rushed to swear an oath to him. After getting the promise, Hero came up with another idea: let the heavy infantry and sailors who led their training sleep in the same tent with their slaves. But they were rejected. Picos and Nurnusis could agree to train slaves, but they would never agree to sleep with these lowly people. On the one hand, this involves dignity, and on the other hand, it is also related to safety.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      In desperation, Shiloh ordered the slaves in teams of ten to elect their own team leaders, and then register the elected slaves.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      While teaching these slave captains how to manage their subordinates, he announced that he would sleep with the slave soldiers.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      As soon as these words were spoken, there was an uproar.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Is he crazy?!\" Misconon exclaimed.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"No, he's not crazy!\" Nurnusis said enviously, \"Look at how happy those slaves are, as if Shiloh has become their god!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"God?\" Demis sneered, \"It seems that only 'God' can bless him to be fine tonight!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Maybe we lost an opportunity!\" Kallikretu, who had been silent all this time, said something that shocked everyone, but he didn't say anything else.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The team chosen by Shiloh was exactly that of Tachiadi.

But he had to pass this test, otherwise these slaves could not really become his soldiers, and he didn't dare to let them protect his back in battle!

With such consumption, the food in the storehouse can't support ten days. Now the price of food in Tarantum has been raised because of our arrival. If you want to buy more, you have to pay more money. And master, you have to consider that it is almost winter.

He built his own tent near the north gate, facing the bank of the Adrothene River, and lived with Sesito and others. Then he asked Picos and Nurnusis to build their tents at the four corners. The women, children, and the elderly lived in the center, and supplies were also piled there. The tents of the slave soldiers were built one after another, and there had to be a distance between each tent for three people to pass through. All the measurement work was done by Sulmus, Keniga, Supate and Kozura.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hilo came to the shore and waded back and forth in the stream again and again. After half an hour, he finally determined that the range he could wade smoothly was about fifty steps below the hill. After the stream rushed out of the valley, it soon flowed into the Budano River. The backflow of the Budano River, which is about twenty meters wide, caused the Adrotheni River to only flood over the ankles when it just came out of the valley. Then the water depth increased rapidly. After fifty steps, the water depth had reached the waist. In addition, there was thick mud under his feet, so wading was already very risky. Hilo slipped and fell into the river. Fortunately, as a seafaring nation, \"he\" was a good swimmer, otherwise the consequences would be disastrous. Therefore, in the dark night, he did not dare to take risks again, and the survey of the terrain would be left until tomorrow.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      At night, Shiloh and Picos personally led the slave soldiers to take turns on duty, not daring to relax for a moment.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",

The heavy infantry wearing bronze armor, holding iron shields and spears surprised the messenger. You know, in the previous Battle of the Budano River, the most important reason why the Brutti were defeated was that they could not break through the thick shield wall of the Greek heavy infantry. Although the Lukelamites did not participate in the battle, they also had a lot of knowledge. The messenger walked into the camp with an uneasy mood, and soon he found that there were not many heavy infantry, but more slaves with branding on their bodies. The camp was not large, and there were not many tents (in fact, it was because of the rush last night, resulting in 20-30 people living in one tent.). This made him regain his confidence.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Going further, he saw women and children, who were chatting leisurely on the sidewalks, while the children were playing around the tents, as if they were not in the land of the Bruttii, but in a Greek city-state. This made the messenger angry.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Then he saw the objects piled in the middle: flour, pottery, ironware...\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Sorry, please go this way!\" Su Peit hurriedly blocked his sight and pointed in another direction.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The messenger could not help but look back at the pile of items. Those were the things that the Brutti had been buying from the Greeks, but because of the war, they became scarce.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Finally, the messenger met the owner of the camp in the tent - a burly and strong man, but his childish face betrayed his youth.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Are you the leader here?\" The messenger asked in Greek with his hands behind his back, looking at him suspiciously.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Yes. We are Athenians. We left Athens for some reason and bought this land from Tusim. I know you are from Lukelam. We don't want to conflict with you, nor do we want to interfere in your war with Tusim. Please convey our goodwill to your leader!\" said Hero, motioning Subate to bring a glass of wine to the messenger.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Peace?\" The messenger stretched out his hand and the wine spilled all over Supai, and the wine cup fell to the ground with a crisp sound.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Anchialo and his men, who were guarding outside the door, rushed in immediately.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The messenger ignored their existence, pointed at Shiloh and shouted, \"As long as you still occupy this land, there will never be peace between you and the Lukelam people! Because this land belongs to us Lukelam people, not Tusim! If you want to leave here safely, you must pay a price!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Oh, I wonder what the price is?\" Shiloh asked calmly.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Leave behind all the items piled outside, and we, the Lukelam people, will not pursue your act of occupying our land and will let you leave safely!\" The messenger's arrogant eyes revealed extreme greed.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh laughed loudly, and his laughter made the messenger a little uneasy. He threatened: \"I tell you, we Lukelam people have more than a thousand brave warriors. If you don't accept this condition, our warriors will wipe out your simple camp and kill you all! Use your heads to sacrifice to the God of Nim Mountain!! \"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Greedy Lukelam!\" Shiloh said disapprovingly, \"You should worry about how to leave here safely.\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Drag him away and beat him with ten military sticks! Then cut off his nose, strip him naked, and send him back!\" Shiloh showed a ferocious face at this time.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Anchialo, who had been unable to contain himself any longer, rushed forward and grabbed him like a chicken.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Let me go! I am the messenger of the Lukelam people! If you dare to be rude to me, our warriors will definitely fight for me...Ah!!!\" The messenger's shrill scream reached Shilo's ears. He just smiled and said to himself: \"Next, they will be unable to resist and come to kill us all...\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      …\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh immediately sent 15 slaves led by Kozura across the river to scout Lukelum. Even if there was no news, one person had to report back every half hour. Then he carefully observed the situation on both sides of the Adrothene River and had a plan in mind. Then he asked Picos to lead the slaves to make a detailed transformation of the possible battle area. Since Lukelum was only half a day's journey away, everyone took urgent action, hoping to make all preparations before the enemy arrived.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      However, by dusk, the enemy still hadn't appeared, and everyone was puzzled: Didn't the enemy plan to attack today?\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Hiro realized that the enemy was not so easy to deal with. Just think about it, he was able to attack Tusim when he was weak, and he had already instigated a Tusim elder to rebel beforehand, thus defeating Tusim, the overlord of the Brutti in one fell swoop. The Lukelam people were very patient, cunning, and had a good grasp of timing.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Will this be a tough opponent? A shadow fell over Shiloh's heart.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The key is that Shiloh's troops are too few in number, so he can only choose to defend, not attack. Therefore, the time of the battle is determined by the enemy, but if he discovers the enemy's actions early, the battlefield will be decided by him. Once the enemy enters the battlefield he has set, his chances of winning will be much greater.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      He believed that the enemy would definitely come! And they would come soon! Because for a tribe that wanted to sit on the throne of the Bruttiyi leader, if the envoy suffered such a great humiliation, if he did not retaliate immediately, then if the matter spread, it would only be ridiculed by other tribes.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Could it be that they wanted to attack at night? A thought flashed through Hiro's mind. The incident in Sicily left a deep impression on him, and he didn't think this was a good way to attack, but things are unpredictable.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      After thinking about it, he sent another thirty people to Kozula, who took turns to monitor the movements of the Lukelam stronghold and report back every quarter of an hour. All the people in the camp, except the sentinels, immediately finished their dinner and went to sleep, so that they could have enough energy to deal with the battle that might happen at any time.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      …\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Master! Master! The enemy is coming! The enemy is coming!!\" The sleeping Hiro was woken up by Cecito.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh turned over and sat up, all sleepiness gone: \"How many people are here?!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"It was dark and Kozula couldn't see clearly.

Charge!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Tachiadi and his teammates rushed forward like arrows on a taut string! Breaking through the thick fog, he saw no longer just one or two black dots, but a dense crowd of people, who were crowded in the river, and some had already stepped onto the river bank.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Taqiadi's iron shield hit an enemy heavily, and then he stabbed out with the spear in his hand. Countless soldiers did the same thing as him. Just this collision and stabbing caused more than a dozen casualties among the Lukelam vanguard.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      The Lukeram people were stunned by the thunderous blows of the slave soldiers. They were still dreaming of slaughter, but they didn't know that the enemy was ready. The Lukeram people in the front row retreated in a hurry, while the people behind them didn't understand what was happening in front of them and rushed forward. As a result, they were in a mess. There was more silt in the river than usual. It was the masterpiece of Shiloh. Countless Lukeram people fell into the river and were then trampled by their tribesmen.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Shiloh stood behind the infantry phalanx, and next to him was the reserve team composed of more than 80 workshop slaves. At this time, Shiloh had created two precedents in the military history of the Mediterranean: one was that the commander did not go directly into battle, but commanded from behind; the other was the establishment of the reserve team. Even in the period of Alexander of Macedonia, the great emperor was still accustomed to charging into battle and was in danger many times; while the latter had to wait until the decisive battle between Caesar and Pompey, when Caesar used the reserve team for the first time. The well-prepared spearmen ambushed behind the phalanx and rushed out at a critical moment, defeating Pompey's cavalry and thus laying the foundation for victory. The combination of these two means that the battle is no longer out of control after the start of the war, but can be readjusted and planned according to the battlefield situation. The direction and process of the attack.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Although Shiloh could not see the battlefield situation, the enemy's shouts and screams kept coming into his ears, which made him know that the enemy was in panic. The plan of the Lukelam people became their biggest obstacle. In the thick fog, you can't see your feet or the enemy clearly, which will only accelerate the spread of fear.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      Then they would be even more afraid! Shiloh raised his spear and shouted, \"Attention, reserve troops, throw stones!\"\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      \"Throw stones! Throw stones!\" At this moment, Su Paite, acting as Shiloh's messenger, was running and shouting in front of the reserve team.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      When Kongda and his fellow blacksmiths heard the command, they immediately picked up the stones that had been polished yesterday afternoon and threw them out with force.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n     <font style=\"vertical-align: inherit;\">\n      These bread-sized stones flew over the infantry phalanx and fell into the river. The river was now crowded with countless Lukelam people, so the hit rate was quite high, which caused them to panic even more.\n     </font>\n    </font>\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </body>\n</html>\n",
