Chapter 1135 Crossroads The Cape of2021-01-28Author : Xin Haiyue 1 Good Hope, as the trigger of this world war, is now at the end of the battle.

Seeing with his own eyes that the defense lines were constantly being breached by the enemy, but unable to do anything, the tortured Lieutenant General Stad became haggard.

Unlike the last South African War, the British had naval fire support, and now the Cape of Good Hope is an isolated island.

Every time the Royal Navy came over, the enemy's air force followed one after another, leaving no room for action.

In order to reinforce the Cape of Good Hope, Britain had paid a heavy price in just two months with the sinking of 3 warships and 18 merchant ships.

It's not how powerful the enemy's air force is, the key is how powerful the enemy's assists are. Of the many ships sunk in Britain, not one was sunk directly by the enemy.

Including the three sunk warships, they all died under the waves after being damaged by the enemy.

There is no other way. The Cape of Despair has winds and waves exceeding two meters all year round, and waves of six to seven meters are common. From time to time, there are typhoons exceeding level 11.

It is very dangerous for a ship to travel while it is intact, not to mention if the hull is damaged. Whether it can save a life depends on God's blessing.

In order to avoid the attack of the Shinra Air Force, the logistics supply was forced to be carried out at night. The waves were dangerous during the day, let alone at night.

Fortunately, it is summer in the southern hemisphere. If it were winter, the strong monsoon and the mysterious "murder wave" would make the scene suffocating.

Rubbing his forehead, the tired Lieutenant General Stad ordered the guards: "Send a message back home and ask when the reinforcements will arrive?" So far in the war, the Cape of Good Hope has received three waves of reinforcements, and the total strength once exceeded two one hundred thousand.

Unfortunately, most of these reinforcements are Indian colonial troops. They can be used as cannon fodder to make up the numbers, and their combat effectiveness is not mentioned.

The only ones with some combat effectiveness are the two Australian and New Zealand divisions. Unfortunately, this combat effectiveness is also very limited.

Anyway, they are being suppressed and beaten by a group of noble private troops. Lieutenant General Stade of the colonial army has completely despaired. The only hope now is to send reinforcements from the mainland.

Telegrams for help have been sent many times, but they have all been rejected by the country on the pretext of "expanding the army."

Lieutenant General Stade fully understands the difficulties at home. The army's establishment is just that big. After the expansion, it expanded more than ten times. There is a serious shortage of officers at the grassroots level. Basically, veterans have become officers.

All of them are newly formed troops. Without running-in training, there is no way to enter the battlefield.

Understandable is understandable, time waits for no one on the battlefield. With just a group of colonial troops facing off against the enemy, there was no way they could fight back.

Although the combat effectiveness of the new domestic troops is equally worrying, the officers are veterans, and they are better than the temporary colonial cannon fodder.

There is no way, most of the British colonial troops came from India, but now India is also on the front line.

The colonial troops with a little combat effectiveness were all kept locally by the Governor-General of India, and those sent to reinforce other areas were temporarily pulled in to make up the numbers.

These troops are used to do odd jobs and must be watched by someone. When they are put on the battlefield, they are killing the enemy.

Lieutenant General Stade is not a moral freak. If the Cape of Good Hope can be saved by just sending people, he doesn't mind using cannon fodder troops to fill the hole.

It cannot be said that it was completely ineffective. The cannon fodder troops still slowed down the enemy's attack speed, but unfortunately they failed to stop the enemy's attack pace.

Looking at the shrinking defense line, Lieutenant General Stade "sees it with his eyes and is anxious in his heart", fearing that he will lose this strategic location in his own hands and become a sinner of Britain.

The only good thing is that there is more than one unlucky person, and there are even worse backups.

The Far East Fleet has lost Malacca, and Cam Ranh Bay is also in danger; the British East Africa next door is also trapped in an isolated city, and reinforcements cannot get in. It is estimated that it will fall in the next few days.

Everyone is losing the battle, and the people's mental endurance has been tempered. As long as they perform better than their colleagues, the possibility of escaping is estimated to be very high.

In particular, London was still shaking under the enemy's bombing, which attracted the attention of the people, and the firepower was attracted by the big guys in the country.

Without the cooperation of his colleagues, according to past practice, Lieutenant General Stad, who had fought a series of defeats, was either in a military court or on his way to a military court.

It is different now. Unless the Cape of Good Hope falls, it will be impossible for the London government to change its leadership.

On the one hand, there was a shortage of British officers, and on the other hand, no one was willing to jump into this huge pit.

The absolute strength gap cannot be changed by personal power. Even if Jeffrey Amherst is replaced, the result cannot be changed.

Quiet moments are always short-lived. As the sirens sounded, the Cape of Good Hope once again entered a state of "aircrafts suspended in the air and artillery roaring".

The war was raging again. Without waiting for a reply from the country, Lieutenant General Stad turned around and walked towards the headquarters.

After a series of defeats, the morale of the defenders had fallen to the bottom. As for the Indian colonial troops who came from it, their morale has never been high, so naturally it cannot be said to be falling or falling.

Panic, anger, hatred, pessimism, and other negative emotions were spread among the defenders.

The Cape of Good Hope at this moment is like a dynamite bag. It only needs a few sparks to explode.

It's hard for the top brass, but it's even worse for the officers and soldiers on the front line. The days of fighting had already exhausted them physically and mentally.

War is full of dangers, but also full of opportunities. Just like Berlant, after the war broke out, he changed from a big soldier to a captain and company commander.

Although the title has not yet been officially conferred, the appointment has been announced. Rules are meant to be broken, special situations should be dealt with specially, and everything should be kept simple during times of war.

Berlant is not an isolated example in the British army, there are many similar promotions in the front line. It's not that the British Army's promotion system has changed, it's mainly that the death rate for company and platoon-level officers is too high.

Due to the emergency military expansion, there is a serious shortage of grassroots officers, so "talents" can only be promoted from veterans.

But Berlant didn't want this kind of promotion at all. There is no other way. When you become an officer, you have to take the lead in charging into battle. The supervising team is watching from behind, and there is no place to hide.

In just two months, Berlant's company has had five company commanders, and it is impossible for him to be the sixth commander without pressure.

Perhaps due to a curse, one of the five seniors in front was promoted during the army expansion, two were still lying in the rear hospital, and the other two had already met God.

Such a horrific casualty rate is simply a "death company commander". Unfortunately, the appointment was mandatory and Berlant could not refuse.

Continuing to guard the position despite the hail of bullets, Captain Berlant no longer panicked, only numbness remained.

To the east, there were extremely violent explosions, to the south, there were bullets flying across the sky, and on the zenith, there were rows of shells, like a volcano without a base.

Lying down in the temporarily dug trench, Captain Berlant buried his head deeply with no intention of looking out.

The ground had begun to tremble. Based on his own experience, Captain Berlant knew that the enemy tank troops were coming.

"The enemy is coming soon, prepare to fight!"

No matter what, responsibilities must be fulfilled. Although he didn't think that the ragtag group he led could have much effect on the enemy's tanks, resistance was still necessary.

...

Compared with the tension of the defenders, it is much more relaxed for the attacking party. Shinra implements a national reserve system, and the noble private army has returned to the army according to the reserve system.

The battle has now progressed, and it is not only this group of noble private troops participating in the war, but regular troops stationed in Africa have also appeared on the battlefield.

The tank unit launching the attack in front of them is one of the best. Since joining the war, it has been "killing gods when gods block, killing Buddhas when Buddha blocks Buddha", and they are facing each other across the battlefield.

The bully was that the British army lacked anti-tank weapons and did not have enough armored troops. With tanks cooperating with the enemy's infantry, it's hard to think of anything going wrong.

After all, it is a colony. No matter how important the strategic position is, the British cannot put two tank divisions at the Cape of Good Hope, but the Holy Roman Empire can.

In the African continent, which is so large, no one will object to the deployment of two tank divisions, even if a few more tank divisions are deployed.

The British army is different. It is a pocket version of the army, and naturally there are not many armored troops.

For the same tank division, the organization of each country is also very different. One Shinra tank division can almost equal two British tank divisions.

However, the British Army does not have many such a reduced version of tank divisions. It's not that I don't want to do it, but the military budget is limited and I can't afford such expensive toys.

Although the armored force also belongs to the army, in terms of expenditure, it is directly on par with the navy and air force.

For infantry, the cost of a battleship can support a division; but when it comes to armor, even the most advanced battleships today cannot keep up with the daily expenses of a tank regiment. (Based on the three-three-four system, a regiment has 108 tanks.)
They are all forced by reality. If the British Army does not save money, how can the Royal Navy dominate the world.

If the land, sea and air force engage in an arms race, no matter how wealthy the British Empire is, it will not be able to withstand it.

This is determined by the size of the economy. The upper limit of the British Isles is stuck there, and you can't do it even if you want to.

The command cannot keep up, the equipment cannot keep up, the training cannot keep up, and morale cannot keep up. It is an asymmetrical war in the first place, and there will be problems only if the battlefield is not one-sided.

At the enemy's front headquarters, Baron von Reuter, as the supreme commander of the front line, was no longer thinking about the battlefield at the moment.

British South Africa was too small. Although the Cape of Good Hope was famous, it was just that to the Holy Roman Empire sitting on the Suez Canal.

The economic value is average, and the strategic value is also average. "Important" is only for the British. If you control this place, you can avoid being choked by Shinra.

Perhaps with the continuous development of economy and technology, the tonnage of merchant ships will gradually increase, and the importance of the Cape of Good Hope will become prominent in the future.

But that is only a possibility. At present, the Suez Canal route is enough to meet the needs of commercial trade.

Even in the Holy Roman Empire, when calculating military merit, it was inevitably affected by economic and strategic value.

Generally speaking, the higher the economic and strategic value of capturing a place, the greater the credit for conquering the territory will be, and vice versa.

The Cape of Good Hope's low importance to the Holy Roman Empire does not mean that everyone's investment in it is also low. For this war, the African nobles truly contributed money and strength.

Even now that the war is ongoing, many strategic materials on the South African battlefield have been raised and paid for in advance by private individuals.

Although the government will pay for these expenses in the future, it also needs to be converted into military merit. If there is no benefit, who is so warm-hearted?

According to the practice of the Holy Roman Empire, everyone worked together to capture British South Africa, and then the land and property of British South Africa were divided after the war.

The problem now is that everyone has contributed to this war. There are too many people who are qualified to share the cake, but the cake of British South Africa is not big enough.

Uneven distribution of spoils has always been a taboo. If you put in a lot of effort and don't get corresponding rewards, then everyone will have to weigh the pros and cons of participating in the war in the future.

Eventually it will appear: everyone will rush to eat the meat, but no one will care about the bones. Then, it was the military knighthood system's turn to collapse.

Similar cases have occurred in history. The most typical example is the farming and warfare system of the Qin Empire, which collapsed because latecomers had no land to divide.

At present, the Holy Roman Empire has also reached this crossroads. The only difference is that now that we have entered the industrial age, we still have the opportunity to choose again.

Of course, this issue needs to be considered by high-level government officials. As the supreme commander of the front line, Baron von Reuter has not yet thought that much.

Right now, the problem he faces is: how to distribute the spoils so that most people are satisfied when the spoils are not enough.

Although the title and fiefdom were ultimately determined by the emperor, it was Baron von Reuter who was responsible for assessing military merit, including giving detailed disposal plans.

Generally speaking, as long as the frontline military exploits are confirmed to be accurate, the opinions of frontline commanders will be taken into account when dividing fiefdoms and granting titles.

Of course, this is only part of it, and there are more issues that need to be considered in actual operations. For example, the wishes of the individual receiving the award must be taken into consideration as much as possible.

Relatively speaking, nobles had smaller options for fiefdoms, and the larger the fiefdom, the less choice they had.

On the contrary, ordinary soldiers, the kind who obtained more than ten hectares or dozens of hectares of land, basically respected their personal wishes.

Even if they cannot be accommodated, they will be arranged in surrounding areas, and the distance will not be too far away.

Baron von Reuter has carefully calculated that the total number of all armed forces participating in this war is as high as 230,000. According to the military merits calculated on the battlefield, the palm of British South Africa is as big as It would be nice to be able to place ordinary soldiers who have gained military exploits in such a place.

There is no way, there are only 20,000 to 30,000 square kilometers in total, and excluding cities, mountains, forests, and land unsuitable for farming and grazing, the land that can be used to build farms is really limited.

Soldiers are actually easy to handle. British South Africa does not have enough land, so they can just relocate in another area. This war is so exciting that the Vienna government will certainly not be short of land after the war.

The real trouble is with the nobles. According to past tradition, whoever conquers the land will be allocated to whom first. Those who have not participated in the war are naturally not qualified to help.

In the previous anti-French war, the entire African continent was considered a battlefield, so naturally there was no such trouble.

But this Battle of the Cape of Good Hope was independent and not connected to any other battlefield. If the heroes are assigned to other regions, it will violate the unspoken rules of the game and may even lead to boycotts.

Chapter 1136 Kamikaze Agent2021-01-29Author : Xin Haiyue 1 After the artillery fire, only wreckage was left on the ground in Tokyo Bay. The Japanese people were busy cleaning up the ruins, and the scene seemed particularly miserable.

As the saying goes: "Revenge does not last overnight." With the failure of the Malacca naval battle, the Japanese navy lost its sea power, and the Spanish navy immediately came over.

Intercepting merchant ships and bombarding ports has now become a daily routine for the Spanish Navy. It seems that if I don't come over to do something for a day, I feel uncomfortable all over.

Perhaps because of hatred, or perhaps in order to solve the Philippine security problem once and for all, the Spaniards performed particularly eye-catching during the war against Japan.

In this context, the Japanese were naturally unlucky. The Japanese people, who were already in panic, are now panicking.

It's just that the imagined liquidation of HRE did not wait, but the Spanish's revenge came first.

If you can save your life with Shinra by "attacking the Russians", the Tokyo government and the Spaniards have nothing to talk about.

One is in the east and the other is in the west, with a series of countries in between. Regardless of whether the Russian Empire was doing well or poorly, it had nothing to do with Spain.

Not only do the two sides have no borders in their spheres of influence, there are also very few interest disputes in international trade.

Emperor Meiji has been having a very difficult time recently. How to get rid of Spain's entanglement has become the biggest problem for the Japanese government at the moment.

Xiyuanji Gongwang: "In the past half month, we have successively lost hundreds of ships, large and small. Now even fishing boats dare not leave the port, and foreign trade lines have been almost completely interrupted.

Affected by this, domestic prices have increased significantly. The prices are rising, and some industrial raw materials have even been out of stock.

Especially since the front line is still fighting, without local material support, the front line troops may not be able to support it for long.

If no action is taken and the Spaniards are allowed to continue looting like this, the empire may not be able to survive Just..."

The word "collapse" was still unspoken. However, it can be seen from everyone's nervous expressions that the smart people present have already completed their brainstorming.

Everyone is aware of the danger, but how to solve the problem is a big problem.

The navy could not be counted on. The Battle of Malacca had broken the backbone of the Japanese navy. The lucky ones who escaped have not yet come out of their panic.

What's more, now that all the battleships have been wiped out and only a bunch of auxiliary warships are left, leaving the port now is to contribute to the enemy's success.

Foreign Minister Kaoru Inoue: "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has tried its best. We have contacted the Spanish, but they did not talk to us at all.

In order to solve the problem, we even communicated with the Vienna government, and they acquiesced to our continued attack on the Russian Empire. But this does not include restraining Spain.

The Vienna government made it clear that war has broken out. As a major member of the Continental League, Spain has the right to attack any country among the hostile forces." The rules of the game are so ruthless, despite the Vienna government's greeting It can solve the problem, but the Japanese are just not big enough.

The smoke of the Malacca naval battle has just dispersed, and each other is stained with each other's blood. It is impossible not to hate them.

The Vienna government did not retaliate immediately because it was considering the overall situation. How could it possibly ask about Spain's small matter of retaliate against the Japanese.

If you can't stand it, that's because you don't have the ability. You can't even get through Spain, and it's probably unrealistic to suppress Russia.

Unable to help the Holy Roman Empire suppress the Russian Empire, Japan would lose the value of its existence. Once a chess piece loses its use value, it is abandoned.

If it wants to preserve Japan and its own prosperity and wealth, the Japanese government must solve its current troubles and prove that its existence is valuable.

"There is no way to deal with the Spanish warships. In the Battle of Malacca, the enemy used air force bombing, and we can also follow suit.

If it doesn't work, we can recruit death squads, strap bombs to the planes, and ram them directly into the enemy warships. .

Spain has become corrupt, and it is very difficult to maintain the current size of the navy. They cannot afford to lose."

Although Yamagata Aritomo's proposal is cruel, it is generally true. Without risking human lives, the current Japanese navy is no match for the enemy.

Although playing kamikaze cannot defeat the Spanish navy in the same way, it can at least drive the Spanish away and restore the trade lines in the Far East.

It is impossible to object. In Japan these days, the most valuable thing is human life. As long as the problem can be solved, no matter how many people die, there is no pressure on everyone.

Naturally, the emperor cannot be involved in a decision that will bring infamy in the future. Prime Minister Katsura Taro, a professional scapegoat, immediately made the decision: "Okay, let's do it!
I don't care what method you use, as long as you drive the Spanish navy out of the Japanese waters, it will be the greatest victory!
In this crisis of survival, I hope everyone will Put aside your prejudices and work together to overcome difficulties."

Obviously, the last sentence was meant for the military. Although there are internal struggles in the government, they are far less intense than those between the army and the navy.

After the Battle of Malacca, the Japanese navy, which originally had the upper hand in the struggle, was directly stepped on by the army.

Nowadays, most of the jokes circulating among the people to insult the Navy are compiled by the Army, and their main purpose is to discredit the Navy.

Katsura Taro, who was originally from the army, should also follow suit, but as the Prime Minister of Japan, he must consider the overall situation.

After all, Japan is an island country. Since it is an island country, it is destined to be inseparable from the navy.

Especially the arrival of the Spanish navy made Katsura realize the importance of the navy. If we continue to suppress the navy, I am afraid Japan will have no future.

As for the effect, it depends on whether everyone's minds are clear. Anyone who realizes the importance of sea power will not kill the navy.

Militarism is not without its advantages. Not only in terms of efficiency, it is far ahead of democratic countries; it even catches a lot of dead soldiers.

As soon as the news of recruiting pilots to ram warships spread, there was a long queue at the recruitment point. Unfortunately, there are barriers to becoming a pilot, and not just anyone can become a pilot, so we can only live up to everyone's enthusiasm.

The more people are discouraged from signing up, the more motivated they are to sign up. Just like in the late World War II, many pilots were forced by public opinion to sign up to join the death squads.

Driven by the butterfly effect, the famous "Kamikaze" entered the stage of history ahead of schedule.

Then, there is no more. There is absolutely no experience to talk about when a plane collides with a warship, and it is impossible to even train for it.

As long as it crashes head-on, no matter whether it hits the target or not, both the man and the machine will be destroyed.

...

On March 16, 1905, the HRE East African Front troops captured Djibouti. The remaining British troops were forced to lay down their weapons and surrender, and the East African Campaign came to an end.

Overnight, the Cape of Good Hope became Britain's last stronghold on the African continent, and the pressure on the London government increased.

Underneath an inconspicuous building, a temporarily converted air-raid shelter is the British government conference room.

Due to the construction deadline, there was no time to decorate the conference room. Perhaps for the sake of beauty, or perhaps for convenience, the surrounding walls are covered with military maps.

Even in the center of the desk, there is a huge sand table. Standing inside it feels like you're in a military headquarters, but this is really a government conference room.

The military style of the interior was forced out by the war. Since the outbreak of the war, the main responsibility of the British government has changed from governing the country to serving the war effort.

Colonial Secretary Corman: "We can't let this go on! If we don't take action, we will lose Africa permanently."

Losing Africa is not enough, at least there is still Madagascar. But an isolated island obviously cannot be compared with a continent.

Once the Cape of Good Hope fell, Britain's route to the Indian Ocean would be interrupted.

Although it is possible to take a detour, when you open the map, you will know that the detour this time is not a small one.

Without supplies from India, Britain was completely dependent on the Americas. From an overall strategic perspective, this is undoubtedly extremely fatal.

Everyone knows that preserving the Cape of Good Hope is important, but no one can accurately answer how to preserve the Cape.

"The Ministry of War has sent reinforcements, but if you want to keep the Cape of Good Hope, you still need the cooperation of the Logistics Department, the Navy and the Air Force."

It's not that Marcus wants to pass the blame, but the Cape of Good Hope is in a special situation. Not only were the winds and waves strong, there was also a lack of water.

In later generations, Cape Town was known as "the most water-scarce city in the world." Although it is not that serious now, after being cut off from the external water supply, it is still difficult to meet the demand with groundwater alone.

During the last South African War, the colonial government in Cape Town experienced the lack of water, and even used ships to transport fresh water to the front line.

Lessons learned after the war, the colonial government increased its freshwater reserves. But what bureaucrats are best at is three-minute heat.

To reserve domestic water for hundreds of thousands of people cannot be done by just a few reservoirs. This requires a lot of manpower, material resources, and a long-term investment.

Except for the first governor-general after the war who was very enthusiastic about it and attached great importance to it, subsequent successors were not interested in this thankless project.

It is enough to have a grand plan, a large investment, and a long duration. The key is that it cannot produce political achievements. Even after the construction of the underground water storage project was completed, everyone did not have much intuitive experience.

Instead of filling this bottomless hole, it is better to use money to build cities and improve transportation. At least these are visible to everyone.

Anyway, as long as there is no war, Cape Town will not be short of water. Smart bureaucrats naturally know how to choose.

But now the war has broken out, and with the continuous shrinking of the defense line, insufficient water resources have also become a problem that plagues the defenders of Cape Town.

What's even more tragic is that the enemy's air force is rampant, plundering overhead every day, and ships entering the port during the day are like going through disaster.

If the logistics problem is not solved, even if reinforcements are sent in, it will only increase the enemy's record.

Feeling the concerned eyes of everyone, Air Force Minister Attilio waved his hand helplessly: "Don't look at me like that. Everyone knows the situation of the Air Force. If we can suppress the enemy, we will not be so passive."

London Sky Our safety cannot be guaranteed, let alone the Cape of Good Hope. Even if fighter planes are dispatched, it will only delay for a few more days at most, but it still cannot change the outcome of failure.

The Battle of the Cape of Good Hope itself was a short-term attack. Attilio was not optimistic about the confrontation with the Holy Roman Empire on land.

No matter how important the Cape of Good Hope is, if we cannot win, we cannot win. Britain could send reinforcements, and so could the enemy.

For a time, the shadow of failure came to everyone's mind. For the first time, everyone seriously thought about the possible consequences of failure in the war.

Seeing everyone's solemn expressions and hesitation, Minister of Military Affairs Sigmund said slowly: "There is even worse news. According to the news from our intelligence personnel lurking in the Holy Roman Empire, the enemy is planning a landing operation. The specific operation plan, It's not clear yet. However, we can roughly infer that the enemy is preparing to use the navy and air force to cover the landfall of the army.

If the enemy's air superiority cannot be disrupted, the risk of the Royal Navy intercepting the enemy's landing is very high.

Maybe this is a It is a trap that deliberately lures the main force of our navy to a specific battlefield and uses the power of the air force to encircle and annihilate it."

True and false, false and true. As the war continues, both sides have been passing on false information to each other.

It's just different this time. Once the enemy launches a landing operation, even if it knows it may be a trap, the Royal Navy can only bite the bullet and attack.

Conspiracies are so terrible. You must step out of the way even if you know there are pitfalls. It is impossible for the British government to gamble with the safety of the British Isles.

If the Royal Navy does not dispatch to intercept, the enemy will pretend to be real. Once the enemy successfully lands, the Oceanic Alliance will immediately fall apart.

No matter how tightly everyone was tied together before and how great the interests involved were, at the critical moment of life and death, everyone still had to fly separately when disaster strikes.

In fact, if it weren't for the inconvenience of information transmission these days, and countries were just immersed in Britain's past prestige and did not know the specific situation, I am afraid that some people would have started to cut their losses.

It is dangerous to jump off the ship in advance, but the probability of survival is higher than struggling for life after the ship sinks.

Without the support of allies, relying solely on the strength of the British Empire, once it enters the stage of close combat, failure will be a matter of time.

Admiralty Swinding said harshly: "This is definitely the enemy's conspiracy against the Royal Navy. Landing before gaining sea power is a risk in itself.

Even if the enemy has air superiority, the air force is not omnipotent. If you want to It is still difficult to cover the landing of the army.

It is inconvenient for surface ships to dispatch, but submarines can also be used. If we sink a troop transport ship at random, a regiment of troops will be gone. Such a loss cannot be ignored by anyone.

If we are really desperate, We can also imitate the Japanese and organize death squads to use planes to ram enemy ships.

One person, one plane, one bomb for one ship, we..."

(End of Chapter)

Chapter 1137 Sometimes too many soldiers are troublesome.2021-01-30Author : Xin Haiyue 1 Good things don't work, but bad things work. Maybe it was because he was open-mouthed, but only a week later, bad news came.

Large armies were gathering towards the French coast. You don't need to think about it to know that this is for the British Isles.

After hearing the bad news, Swinding couldn't care less and hurriedly asked the director of military intelligence: "Have the enemy's warships been commissioned?"

To land on the British Isles, a naval battle was indispensable. Shinra has air force cover, and Britain also has air force.

Even if it is a little bit weaker, once you put your life into action, you can still contain it in a short period of time.

In order to protect the troop transport, the Shinra Navy had to fight. Based on the current strength comparison between the two sides, the Royal Navy still has a greater chance of winning.

The only thing that can change this situation is the commissioning of new warships. Although the construction time is a little tight, the enemy is the world's largest industrial power. If you work overtime, it is reasonable to complete it ahead of schedule.

In fact, as early as more than a month ago, the Naval Intelligence Department received information about the launch of the enemy's capital ship, but it was not confirmed.

From launching into service to forming combat effectiveness, it certainly cannot be completed in just over a month, but haven't the landing operations not yet begun?

A war also takes a long time from preparation to launch. When the preparations are completed, the training may also be completed.

Director of Military Intelligence Lacerda nodded: "What is certain at present is that the enemy has at least two Dreadnought-class battleships in service. The enemy's capital ships started construction at almost the same time. Even if the other battleships have not yet entered service, I am afraid they will It won't be long."

After receiving the positive news, Swinding felt completely unwell.

One step is slow, each step is slow.

The construction of Britain's battleships was already delayed, and the shipyard was attacked by the enemy midway, so the construction progress was even slower.

Once this batch of enemy warships enter service, the Royal Navy will be at an absolute numerical disadvantage at the level of dreadnoughts.

Although the quality is not enough, we can still make up the quantity. But the dreadnought has the ability to kill ordinary warships. Who knows how much it will cost to erase this advantage?

If the Royal Navy is not sure of victory, then its joke of "one man, one machine, one bomb for one ship" will become a reality.

Death soldiers are easy to find, but death soldier pilots are not easy to get. Although they are both island countries, the British Empire is not Japan after all, and there are people rushing to recruit death squads.

If nothing else, just look at the London air battle. Once the fighter plane was damaged, it immediately turned around and ran away. When it was found that it could not escape, the pilot immediately bailed out.

While preserving manpower to the maximum extent, many aircraft were wasted, and many aircraft that could have been salvaged were abandoned.

Don't blame them. Those who dare to fight in the sky are heroes. There are also a group of pilots who even refuse to fight.

The reason is very good: the performance gap between aircraft is too great, and an asymmetrical battle will lead to death. Since he was going to die, he naturally couldn't go.

It is not popular in Britain to "look at death as if it were home". The extremely high battle losses in the early stage gave the British government no confidence.

Except for active duty pilots who cannot escape and must go to the battlefield, amateurs and civil aviation pilots have the right to refuse.

The main reason is that the compulsory military service law has not yet been enacted, and the government's penalties for those who refuse to be drafted are very limited.

...

Just as the British were in panic, the international situation was quietly changing. The ensuing bad news continued to erode everyone's confidence in the British Empire.

The defense war for India has begun. HRE is attacking from both sides of Persia and Indochina. Although the distance is still far away, no one thinks that the Persians and a group of colonial troops can stop the world's largest army power.

In particular, the Russians also sent troops from Afghanistan, and British India was essentially embattled on all sides.

To fight alone against the world's largest and second largest army powers, distance and terrain alone are not enough. Unless the British can cheat, there is no hope at all.

British Africa has almost fallen. If there is no more India, will Britain still be an "empire"?

No matter how powerful the Royal Navy is, it cannot reverse the defeat on land. What's more, they lost the Battle of Malacca.

The battle to defend the Strait of Gibraltar had begun, and the Spanish, stimulated by the victory, finally plucked up the courage to launch an attack on Gibraltar.

It is estimated that they are preparing to replicate the victory of the last anti-French war and use the prestige dividend brought by the victorious country to return to the ranks of great powers.

Great powers are not just a name, but also contain a lot of interests behind them, which is especially important for big trading countries.

For example: the comprehensive national strength of the United States and the Alliance is not weak, but because they do not have the reputation of a great power, they have no say in the international community.

Although Spain's strength is not good, its reputation is still resounding these days, and its international voice is second only to Britain, Austria and Russia.

Of course, this was only the early stage of the victory of the Anti-French Alliance. Later, the reputation of the Philippines was greatly damaged due to the war, and then the national power was consumed in suppressing the colonial war, and the right to speak in the international arena also dropped a lot.

Russia and Spain have both joined in, and naturally the European wallflowers can't sit still. Downwind battles are always everyone's favorite.

What's more, the Vienna government promised huge profits and directly used "India" as bait. How could governments of other countries endure it?
With the active support of various countries, the continental coalition has already taken shape and only needs the final integration. Once these tasks are completed, it's time for the decisive battle.

Compared with the concentration of the member states of the Continental League, the member states of the Oceanic Alliance are much more dispersed. They are all far and wide, and if they want to gather together, they have to travel across the ocean.

The difficulty of integrating power is more than one level higher.

Although the British government has worked very hard, due to the distance, the integration progress of the Ocean Alliance has been more than one step slower.

If the war lasts for two or three years, the forces of the Ocean Alliance will naturally be able to gather together; but judging from the current situation, the enemy will definitely not leave them enough time.

As the enemy's strength continues to grow, the situation on the battlefield is becoming increasingly unfavorable to the Ocean Alliance. Governments of various countries are also seeing this and are anxious in their hearts.

The navies of various countries have already participated in the escort movement, the air force has also dispatched elite pilots to reinforce Britain, and the army has also begun to gather.

Just trying to beat the Continental League was still not enough. Having gathered the power of the entire European continent, it is invincible these days.

More and more knowledgeable people realize that getting involved in this war is a mistake.

It's a pity that there is everything in this world, but there is no regret medicine. It is easy to join a war, but difficult to withdraw.

On the surface, everyone is still a good ally of Britain and is working hard for this war, but privately, there is an undercurrent.

Everything depends on the final battle. If Britain can crush the "Sea Lion Project" and keep India at the same time, then everyone will still be a good ally.

But if an accident occurs to one of them, there is no choice but to endure the pain and cut the flesh to stop the loss.

It can only be said that empiricism kills people. In every continental war in the past two hundred years, the British were the final winners.

The long-term victory has brought confidence to everyone. In addition, the Royal Navy has superior sea power, and all countries are isolated overseas. The worst outcome that can be expected is nothing more than invincibility.

According to the British's promise, even if they are undefeated, we can still divide the overseas colonies of the Holy Roman Empire, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal and other countries.

It is a pity that the reality is cruel. The British Empire, which missed the second industrial revolution, is like an old man in his twilight years and no longer has the vitality of the past.

… Diplomatic turmoil has revived internationally, and the battlefield is blooming in all directions. With the defeat in the Malacca naval battle, the British had to carry out strategic contraction in the Far East.

Except for Indochina, which is still fighting, other regions have reluctantly cut off their flesh and blood. But this was not enough, and the Continental Alliance did not give them a chance to breathe.

The high-spirited Governor William is now in pain and happiness. Every man has a heroic dream of galloping on the battlefield. Now the opportunity to command an army has finally come, but William has a headache.

Not everyone has the ability to "Han Xin orders troops, the more the better". At least Governor William does not have the ability to command an army of millions.

If the war had not broken out, no one would have believed that the Continental Alliance could actually mobilize millions of troops in the Nanyang region.

However, reality actually happened. The Dutch sent 100,000 troops, the Spanish 80,000 troops, the Portuguese 3,000 troops, plus 130,000 troops directly under the Austrian Nanyang. Together with the aristocratic coalition and civilian armed forces that came one after another, the total military strength just broke through the million mark. .

That's not all, there are new troops joining every day, seemingly in an endless stream, which makes Governor William have a headache.

Unlike Africa, which has a complete organizational structure and can be organized directly according to the previous reserve structure, most of them in Nanyang are in bulk.

European immigrants alone cannot raise an army of one million, but with the addition of Lanfang Autonomous Province, it becomes more than enough.

The only thing to blame is that the military merit title system is attractive. After so many years of operation, Emperor Franz's reputation has long been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

In the past, everyone who wanted to participate had no chance. The main reason is that it is too far away from the battlefield, so the people gathered here before the recruitment order could reach them.

Now that an opportunity has arrived, Lanfang's Chinese family can't sit still. Driven by interests, everyone overcame their fear of the British and joined the war one after another.

In addition, the nobles continued to recruit private armies in order to seek greater military success, and the coalition's ranks expanded rapidly.

If you don't love war, it's just that you don't have enough interests. Everyone knows that the emperor is very generous and allocates land in hectares.

Even if you can't get a title, it's still worthwhile to get a piece of land. Wealth and honor are found in danger, but all aspiring young people who want to make a comeback have appeared in the army.

If you look carefully, you can also find the presence of international students. Not only did he participate himself, he even went back to his country to recruit people.

The momentum of the million-strong army has increased, but their combat effectiveness has decreased. In addition to the directly affiliated troops, only the military nobles and private armies have combat effectiveness, and the rest are just ragtag groups.

In the eyes of Governor William, the troops sent by Spain and the Netherlands were just following suit.

Although he knew it was a mob, William couldn't refuse everyone's enthusiasm to join the war. On the one hand, it is the bundling of interests, and on the other hand, it is to put enough pressure on the British.

Regardless of whether it is a mob or not, with the numbers here, the British must send out heavy troops to intercept them.

Anyway, these are bad times. The Continental Alliance has only two to three hundred thousand main battle troops, and the rest are just a mob. The British are even more miserable.

The reinforcements that came from the mainland were all newly formed troops, and the colonial troops that were raised temporarily were the best among the rabble.

If there really was a fight, William felt that his side would have a better chance of winning. There are also mostly mobs, but at least the morale of the troops on my side is high.

The large number of civilian armed forces was not forced by William. He just issued a call and everyone came to their door.

Since we are fighting for ourselves, our morale cannot be low. Especially when taking the oath of war before, William's speech went to the head, and he directly promised the entire army that after winning the war, the death pension would be no less than 500 Aegis, or five hectares of land.

Local immigrants and regular soldiers have little to do with it. According to past practice, this is just normal operation. The various subsidies added up one after another are often higher than the pension in the end.

But others can't. Five hundred Aegis can be equivalent to more than a thousand taels of silver. Judging from the economic level of the Far East, it is an astronomical sum for 99% of the people.

The five hectares of land were even more tempting because they were military fields. In the Holy Roman Empire, military fields were permanently tax-free as long as they were not sold.

This kind of money to buy a life is already sky-high in the Far East. In a sense, the continuous flow of people joining was also stimulated by William himself.

Now that the words have been spoken, they must be fulfilled. Having been influenced by Franz for a long time, William naturally knows the importance of credibility.

The reputation of the Habsburg dynasty cannot be bought with money. There is no need to compromise on its reputation just to save 80 million.

What's more, from his point of view, five hundred Aegis is really not much for one person to sacrifice his life for. Not to mention the land, it was all taken from the enemy, so there is no need to feel bad.

As the king's reserve, William also needed to establish his credibility.

There are many ethnic groups living in Nanyang. If he could spend hundreds of millions to establish his credibility among all ethnic groups, William would definitely be willing to pay the bill based on his understanding of his father.

What's more, there is no need to pay for the war now. The Vienna government has always borne all the war expenses. At most, the royal family takes the lead in donating money at critical moments.

Donations were not even needed now, the war had only been going on for a few months, and the Vienna government's pockets had not yet been depleted so quickly.

It is impossible to lead a ragtag army into battle without psychological pressure. Don't expect to fight all the way to occupy India, at least we must conquer the Indochina Peninsula.

Chapter 1138: The Americans of the Americans2021-02-01Author : Xin Haiyue 1 Facing the menacing Continental Allied Forces, the British colonial government of Indochina was dumbfounded. Indochina, which has lost its sea rights, is like a house with leaks from all sides, unable to withstand wind and rain.

Even if the gap in combat power between the two sides is ignored, the number alone in Indochina alone cannot exceed one million. However, the enemy also has sea and air superiority and can attack from all sides.

Telegrams for help reached London and then to India.

After the Battle of Malacca, the Far East route was interrupted. Even if the mainland sends reinforcements immediately, they will still have to take a detour from India.

Time waits for no one on the battlefield, and the mainland coalition forces are coming over just as they watch. Now only India can support the British Indo-Central Peninsula.

After the outbreak of the Hegemony War, the Indian colonial army expanded rapidly, with its total strength exceeding the four million mark.

The data on paper shows that they are absolutely strong. Even the total strength of the land, sea and air forces of the Holy Roman Empire was less than three million.

But now is the era of industrialization. Although the human sea tactic can still play a role, this role is being weakened.

His own family knew his own affairs. Governor Robert Jervis knew very well what these more than four million colonial troops were.

Command, equipment, training, morale, if there is no qualified army, it is hard to imagine what the combat effectiveness will be.

If they really had fighting power, they wouldn't need to worry about being besieged by Russia and Austria, but they would go out to find bad luck for both countries.

Looking at the rescue telegram in his hand, Robert was heartbroken. To the north is the Russian army heading south, to the west is the HRE army heading east, and now there are millions of colonial coalition forces emerging in the east.

At the same time, facing the world's two largest army powers and fighting on the third front, anyone who encounters them will have their scalp numb.

But no matter how difficult it is, Indochina must be saved. Otherwise, the enemy will fight all the way, and India will be the unlucky one in the end.

Even if we cannot defeat the enemy, we must at least drag the enemy into Indochina to buy time for the country to break the situation.

After hesitating for a long time, Governor Robert said: "Order the Seventh Army and the Eighth Army to rush south to reinforce the Indo-Central Peninsula.

Inform the heads of each department to come over for a meeting in the evening to discuss military expansion."

He clearly has more than four million troops. But it still feels like the troops are not enough. It's incredible to think about it, but reality tells Robert that if he wants to keep India, he still needs to continue to expand his army.

Upon hearing this appalling news, the assistant on the side quickly persuaded: "Your Majesty the Governor, our army has expanded to the limit. If we continue to expand our army now, I'm afraid..." "I'm afraid there are n't that many. The enemy is coming fiercely, and we don't have enough mobile troops in our hands. If you don't expand the army, what can you do to resist it?

If the number of grassroots officers is insufficient, they should be trained quickly, or they should be promoted directly from veterans . If there are insufficient weapons and equipment, they should be recruited from the private sector. It doesn't matter what kind of weapon it is, as long as it can kill the enemy.

What's more, at home, too He gave us strong support. Didn't he just send equipment for two divisions yesterday? Once the immediate emergency is over, things will be fine later."

It's not that Robert likes to use strong words and secretly change concepts. The situation is really difficult. As the governor, he must Show confidence.

The equipment of the two divisions is not a small amount, but compared with the millions of colonial troops now, it is a drop in the bucket.

In order to satisfy everyone with one gun, even the flintlock guns of the last century appeared in the army. Cannon is even older than Governor Robert himself.

No matter how unreliable it is, something is better than nothing. It's not enough to take them out to fight in the field. Defensive fortresses can always play some role.

There is no way around this, and the Indian colonial army is not the only one whose weapons are in disarray. Even the troops in the British Isles cannot guarantee uniform equipment.

It's not that the British government is ineffective, it's mainly due to inherent limitations. As a maritime country, the British Army has long followed the "short and powerful" route.

In the capitalist world, it is always "market orders that determine the scale of industry." The Army has few orders and the related industrial chain will naturally not grow in size.

If you have a brief understanding of the British military industry system, you will know that the army military industry is basically dependent on the naval military industry.

I am afraid that even the industrial chain cannot be maintained purely by relying on orders from the Army. After all, there are still few high-value-added equipment these days, and rifles, machine guns, and ordinary artillery have all passed the period of huge profits.

In a sense, the emergence of armored forces also saved the army's military industry.

Unfortunately, this thing is not practical for Britain at all.

Normally there is no need to use this kind of killer weapon. When it is needed, the enemy has landed on the British Isles and the situation is over.

… When peace cannot suppress the world, the devil will come out and the whole world will fall into “bloody” and “panic”.

From Africa to Europe, and then from Europe to the Near East, Far East, and Indochina, the entire World Island is immersed in blood and fire.

However, this is just the beginning. The American continent, which was isolated overseas, was also not immune. Since the secret negotiations failed, the Ocean Alliance launched an attack on Shinra's colonies in the Americas.

Overnight, Latin America, South America, and the Caribbean became battlefields, and the scope of the world war expanded again.

Austrian Central America is a great place. The Shinra has been operating there for decades. The population has already exceeded 10 million, and the territory is more than one million square kilometers. Extreme mobilization can draw an army of one million.

Even if they were besieged by the enemy on both the north and south fronts, they would not fall behind and even spread the flames of war to the hinterlands of Mexico and Colombia.

Austrian South America can barely make do. Although the local population is just over one million, it is not a problem to block the enemy's attack by sitting on the Andes Mountains and relying on the geographical advantage.

What's more, Shinra is not without allies in America. Although it does not directly take sides, it is not difficult to hold back the Ocean Alliance.

As the war progresses, except for the fall of Alaska in North America, HRE has never lost a large territory.

If you can't beat the boss, you'll look for the weakling, so you'll look for the younger brother to take advantage of you, and then Spain will suffer a tragedy.

Americans, who had long coveted Cuba, could not restrain their ambitions and extended their devil's hand to the Caribbean.

It's just that the United States was not lucky enough. After suppressing the rebellion, the Spanish did not immediately disband the French mercenaries. Instead, they hired them on a long-term basis.

The situation in the U.S.-Spanish-Cuba War changed time and was naturally very different. Different from the one-sided situation in the original time and space, now the war has started and everyone is anxious.

Facts have proved that American soldiers these days are really not suitable for fighting. Even if they have an absolute numerical advantage, they are still suppressed by mercenaries.

If the number of French mercenaries were not limited and they were not willing to work for the Continental Alliance, the American troops who might have landed would have been left in the cold.

The three major battlefields collectively stopped eating, which was embarrassing. As the planner of this operation, Theodore Roosevelt only felt a lot of pressure.

There was a voice deep in his heart that kept reminding him: He must work hard, otherwise he would be with the unlucky Lincoln and become the worst president since the founding of the United States.

Although it was Roosevelt who took the lead, countries who chose to send troops at this time were actually forced to do so.

After private contacts with the Vienna government failed, everyone knew that if nothing was done, when the British ship sank, everyone would be buried with it.

The war has continued until now, and the British boss has been performing very hard, being completely suppressed and beaten.

Sending troops to attack the European continent and help the British boss win the war is naturally a no-brainer.

Everyone is aware of themselves. The Oceanic Alliance combined is not enough to defeat the Shinra family in Europe.

Since an attack was not possible, President Roosevelt took advantage of the situation and proposed "America for Americans" in an attempt to "secure the ocean to protect itself."

To achieve this, we must not only have a strong navy; more importantly, we must pull out the nails around us and not leave a foothold for the enemy.

It's just that the plan couldn't keep up with the changes. The enemy was too stubborn to leave nails behind, and their methods of pulling out nails were too clumsy.

Not only did he fail to pull out the nails left by the enemy, but he accidentally hurt his own hand.

As battle reports from the front continued to come in, Theodore Roosevelt's temper became worse and worse.

"They are all a bunch of trash!"

"A bunch of trash!"

"The United States is corrupted in..."

...

Facing the president's endless curses, the military representatives all lowered their arrogant heads. There is no way, and there is no confidence to say anything after losing the battle.

For this operation, all members of the Oceanic Alliance, except Britain and Japan, sent their most "elite" troops to participate in the war.

A king's start and a bronze record. The coalition forces, which seemed to have an absolute advantage, were directly beaten by the enemy on the battlefield.

Not to mention the heavy losses, the key point is that the strategic plan went bankrupt. If the enemy cannot be driven out of the American continent, they will not be able to withstand the reckoning in the future.

The law does not punish everyone, and whether it can be applied depends on the situation. In a highly exciting game like World War, there are always mistakes to make, so don't let them go.

If other countries surrender, there may be a glimmer of hope; once the United States surrenders, the fate that awaits them is to be split up again.

The failure of private contact is the best evidence. If it were not prepared to deal harsh blows to the United States, the Vienna government would not directly demand unconditional surrender.

From this perspective, other members of the Oceanic Alliance have actually been implicated by the United States.

Without this big boss, the small country is simply not worthy of the Vienna government's special targeting, so let it go.

Perhaps because Roosevelt scolded him too harshly, or perhaps in order to save the last face of the military, Secretary of State Melchor said: "Your Excellency, now that things have happened, it is useless to hold people responsible. The top priority is to deal with the follow-up issues as soon as possible. .

The strategy of driving the Holy Roman Empire out of the Americas cannot be shaken. The power of allies cannot be relied on, and we must find a way on our own." After all, deception is not a long-term solution, and governments are not fools, and they will react sooner or later.

Now that we understand that the Vienna government is really targeting only the United States, everyone knows what choice to make.

Even if governments are slow to respond, the Vienna government will remind them at the appropriate time and guide them to make the right choices.

"If you can't win, then join" is not something to be ashamed of. What is really embarrassing is making the same mistake again and again.

There is only one piece of news left between the betrayal of an ally. Whenever it was determined that the British Empire was going to be defeated, all countries would immediately choose to cut their losses.

It's just a matter of withdrawing. The most fearful thing is that these countries will turn against each other and stab the United States again.

In this regard, the Vienna government is professional and is best at turning the enemy's younger brother into its own younger brother.

The topic was changed, but the military representative did not dare to answer the question. It's easy to rely on your own strength, but the problem is that you really can't win!
The most elite troops in the country were sent out, but in the end they couldn't even capture the Spanish Cuba, let alone face the more powerful Holy Roman Empire.

Of course, this does not mean that the United States cannot do anything to HRE's colonies. As long as there is enough time, national power can drag down Shinra's colonies in America.

The reason why everyone is worried now is because time does not allow. The war for hegemony has reached a critical moment, and the British Empire will be gone if it fails.

Without the British leader to protect them from the wind and rain, the United States alone did not have the strength to confront the Holy Roman Empire.

With Central America as a foothold, even if it is separated by a vast ocean, it cannot hinder the projection of Shinra's power.

Although this power projection cannot be all, not even one-fifth.

However, without fighting, the US military still has no confidence against Shinra's two-tiered military power.

In particular, the enemy is good at calling friends. Even Britain, which is awesome and coaxing, is under siege. If it were the United States, there might be even more countries participating in the siege.

Seeing this scene, President Roosevelt became even more angry. It's just that the military has failed to live up to its expectations, not just for a day or two, and no more scolding will help.

The United States' military fortunes are not prosperous because of historical reasons. The immigrants who came to the United States came to escape the war in Europe and were natural anti-war people.

Especially after the Civil War, the anti-war trend became even more popular. In order to win votes from the people, congressmen have catered to public opinion and turned into anti-war activists.

The military power that rose during the war was quickly suppressed by politicians. Not only has the military establishment been reduced, but the members of Congress are so stingy that they are not even willing to give out the rank of general.

In this context, the military has certainly become a good boy, but good boys are not good at fighting!
Including this war, the public voice against the war is even higher. If it were not for the almost unanimous support of the big domestic capitalists, the United States would not participate at all.

"Doesn't the military have a plan?"

Facing Roosevelt's sharp gaze and knowing that he could not escape this time, Brigadier General Mathias replied bravely: "The enemy has been operating in Central America for a long time, and even sent a prince. The importance of being a governor is evident.

As we all know, the Holy Roman Empire adopted the oldest feudal system in ruling the colonies. Under this system, the feudal nobles had a large number of private armies.

At present, most of these nobles are the first generation. , are all warriors who fought on the battlefield. Although they have retired, they still hold military positions in the reserves..."

(End of this chapter)

Chapter 1139 Countdown to Landing2021-02-02Author : Xin Haiyue 1 Explanation is a cover-up. No matter how good the reasons are, they cannot conceal the fact that the US military's combat effectiveness is insufficient. Repeatedly emphasizing the enemy's strength is nothing more than making excuses for failure.

But if you don't make excuses, you will take the blame. Even if I want to show my courageous side, this is definitely not the time.

No one expected that the situation would develop to this point. Before launching the attack, Roosevelt never dreamed that the seven countries of the Oceanic Alliance would not even be able to take down the enemy's colonies.

If you look through history books, you will know that the vast territory of the United States was seized from the colonial empire.

At that time, each of these countries was more powerful than the United States, but due to geographical factors, the final winner was the United States.

Now there are still British people supporting the front, blocking the connection between the enemy and the colonies. It is the best time to take action. There is no reason for failure when multiple countries join forces.

Unfortunately, the foolproof plan ended in failure. Different from other previous territorial battles, the enemy behaved particularly ferociously this time.

It's okay to hit a snag in Cuba. Anyway, the enemy's troops are insufficient, so as long as they continue to use up the enemy, they can hope to win.

The most important thing is Central America, which is in trouble. The local immigrants are all hedgehogs, and they will get thorns when they touch them.

The intention to invade had just been revealed, but before the coalition forces had finished gathering, they were already attacking.

The two allies, Mexico and Colombia, are now being held underground by the enemy for friction. If the United States does not take action, they will surrender.

As for other allies, only the top three in South America have some fighting capacity. However, in Roosevelt's view, these "three powers" were too watery and had nothing to do with "strength" at all.

How can Argentina and Chile be considered a powerful country when they join forces and can't do anything to Patagonia, which has a population of less than one million.

The most important thing is that unless this nail is pulled out and their rear is stabilized, it will be impossible for the two countries to send troops to reinforce Colombia.

The soy sauce allies should first ignore that just tens of thousands of reinforcements sent by Brazil cannot protect the Republic of Colombia at all.

In this context, the United States will divide its forces into three groups, reinforce Colombia and Mexico at the same time, and also capture Cuba.

The military is obviously overwhelmed with such a heavy task. Unless it is a war of attrition and the advantage of national power is used to slowly wear out the enemy, there is really no chance of victory.

But the reality is cruel. As the war progresses, the international situation becomes increasingly unfavorable to the Ocean Alliance.

Countries that were originally leaning towards HRE are now ready to make a move. If Britain loses again, these countries may be doomed.

You don't have to care whether other countries participate in the war, but the Allied Powers next door must consider it.

Although the British used economic means to tie down the Confederates and keep them neutral, politics could change at any time.

It is difficult to pull out the nails originally, but if another group of enemies is added, the subsequent battle will be even more unwinnable.

It's too late to regret, political slogans have been shouted, the ambitions of the United States have been exposed, and the Vienna government is even less likely to let them go now.

"Americans' America" ​​can also be understood as "Americans' America." If this goal is achieved, Theodore Roosevelt will remain one of the greatest presidents in the history of the United States.

Unfortunately, the opening was not successful and I suffered a blow. But at this point, we can only bite the bullet and fight.

Even if you can't win, you still have to prove your strength on the battlefield so that the enemy doesn't dare to humiliate you.

It does not need to reach the world's top level. As long as the US military shows the combat effectiveness of a second- or third-rate country, the Vienna government will think twice before settling accounts in the future.

...

In the English Channel, with the launch of the "Sea Lion Project", all the main navies of the Continental Alliance gathered here.

There were more than 180 large and small warships, and the scene was huge. Especially the thirty-six super battleships headed by it are even more majestic.

If the British could launch a sneak attack and kill the fleet in front of them, the Continental Alliance would not be able to turn around for at least five years.

But looking at the planes circling in the sky, you know that it is impossible to launch a sneak attack without first solving the eyes in the sky.

Just think about it, the air force is Britain's shortcoming. Whether it is flight altitude, flight speed, or flexibility, Britain's fighter planes are lagging behind an era.

The backwardness of the entire industrial system cannot be caught up in a short while. Even if you increase your investment, it will take time.

On the unobstructed view of the sea, there is no air superiority, only the possibility of being ambushed.

Just look at the Royal Navy. Seeing that the war is about to break out, the Royal Navy has not dared to enter the war.

The English Channel naturally has no shortage of good ports, but the problem is that the ports are within the bombing range of enemy aircraft. If this time passes, it will be like a sheep entering a tiger's mouth.

Originally, after the completion of the navies of the Continental Alliance, the Royal Navy would not have the advantage. If it was bombed by the enemy's air force again, it would be even more impossible to fight.

The Battle of Malacca is a typical case. The enemy first used aircraft to damage the warship, and then the navy pounced on it to finish the damage, easily sealing the victory.

learn from mistakes. The Royal Navy, having learned its lessons, decisively chose to stay away from the HRE Air Force.

You can hide in normal times, but now the enemy is going to land on the British Isles, and your home will be lost if you hide again.

As Lord of the Admiralty, Swinding is now under great pressure, fearing that he may accidentally ruin the Royal Navy and become a sinner of Britain.

Of course, he is not the only one feeling the pressure. Every high-level member of the British government is now experiencing "high pressure."

Just like before a storm, the air is filled with an oppressive and suffocating atmosphere.

...

"Judging from the intelligence collected, the enemy has completed its assembly and will launch an attack on us in the near future. The time has come to test the British Empire. Although we have failed in previous wars, we will never give in. We will Fight to the end.

Unlike any previous battle, now we have unprecedented strength, and the 40 million British people are our most solid backing. The enemy chose to attack the British Isles, which was definitely a mistake. Here we have..."

——Prime Minister Campbell's "Declaration for the Defense of Britain" on April 27, 1905.

To judge whether a country or a nation is great, you can know by looking at their performance in critical moments.

Being able to stand out from many competitors and dominate the world, Britain naturally has its own merits.

As the situation continues to worsen, perhaps because everyone is aware of the danger, the internal struggles within the British government have gradually eased.

Although the opposition parties are still criticizing the government, they are only talking about it now. In fact, they have given up holding back in action.

After constant publicity by the media, everyone from the princes and nobles to the ordinary British people knew what this war meant.

Under the high pressure of the Continental Alliance, the war machine of the British Empire finally started operating at full speed.

There was finally internal unity, but Prime Minister Campbell was not happy at all. If possible, he would rather not have this domestic unity achieved under the threat of enemies.

"With one heart and one mind, we can fight against all odds." It's just a political slogan. What can really determine the outcome of a war is strength.

For the British Empire, the situation had deteriorated beyond control. Even if they win the Battle of England, they can only temporarily avoid the danger of national subjugation. Winning the war is still far away.

War Secretary Marcus: "In order to intercept the enemy's landing, we have deployed one million troops along the English Channel, and there are 500,000 mobile troops in the rear ready for reinforcement. In addition, we have organized one million militia, Responsible for logistics and transportation. If the war situation is urgent, reinforcements can also be sent up.

However, this is only the worst plan. If possible, it is best to keep the enemy out of the British Isles.

Once the war reaches the mainland, even if the enemy is They were all wiped out and we lost."

It can be seen that the Army really tried its best. From the outbreak of the war to the present, the Army has successively sent reinforcements of 500,000, 150,000, and 50,000 troops to India, the Cape of Good Hope, and Indochina.

In order to maintain the stability of Ireland and Scotland, a total of 180,000 troops were stationed in the two places.

With Britain's population of 40 million, mobilizing so many troops was really an effort.

Especially among the 40 million people, there are 3.5 million Scots and 4.4 million Irish.

That's it for the Scots. Although there are conflicts, they generally agree with Britain.

Ireland is different. It has been bullied terribly in the past half century. The local population has dropped from 8.2 million in the mid-19th century to 4.4 million now, and there is a lot of resentment.

Fortunately, the island of Ireland is located far back, otherwise the enemy would land from Ireland and lead the way everywhere.

For safety reasons, the conscripted Irish and Scottish soldiers were basically sent to the colonies.

A large number of young people were taken away, and the place was temporarily stable. But there is no hope of them contributing to this war.

Even though he tried his best, Marcus still felt unsure. The enemy is the entire European continent. It is too difficult for the lobster soldiers to challenge the heroes alone.

"The navy is also ready to fight for the empire at any time. We are confident that we will win. The final victory must belong to the great Britain.

However, the enemy's air superiority cannot be underestimated. Before the decisive battle begins, it is best to first Defeat the enemy's air force, and no matter how hard it is, we must hold them back."

Shouting the loudest slogan and doing the most sincere thing. It's not that Swinding is cowardly, but this war is really difficult to fight.

The navies of the Continental Alliance countries combined are no weaker than the Royal Navy in terms of the number of capital ships and the total tonnage of warships.

If it weren't for the multinational coalition forces on the opposite side and the lack of consistency in command, the Royal Navy wouldn't have much chance of winning.

The few chances of winning were wiped out by the enemy's air superiority. As a result, the Royal Navy was delayed in arriving at the battlefield and had to wait until the last moment to reduce the risk of being attacked by air raids.

The Army and Navy both had good reasons, but the Air Force was embarrassed and couldn't shirk it even if they wanted to. One of the core factors that has worsened the situation to this point is the inability of the air force to do so.

It's worse than the original time and space. At least the British fighter planes during World War II were no worse than the Germans, and there were American wet nurses to replenish blood.

Nowadays, limited by industrial strength, the performance of locally produced aircraft is inferior. The fighter planes produced by the Americans can only be used for daily training. If they are used in a decisive battle, they will lose their lives.

The Air Force wants to work hard, but reality does not allow them to explode. I finally swallowed my anger and accumulated a fortune for several months, but it was just beginning to take shape and faced a tough battle.

Air Force Minister Attilio, who had no confidence in his heart, naturally did not dare to make a guarantee now. After all, while our family is building up strength, our enemies are not idle either.

Comparing the aviation industry strength of the two countries, if Britain builds one fighter plane, Shinra can build four or five. With the Continental Alliance, the gap will be even greater.

As for imitating Japan and recruiting pilot death squads, that's a joke. After finally waiting for more than a dozen people to sign up, they started to retreat one after another before they could go out to compete.

There is no way, Britain does not have a social atmosphere that kills people for mercy, unless it is a moment of heat, and when you calm down, no one will do such a lifeless job.

If you really want to implement it, you still have to wait for a crisis moment before fooling the hot-blooded young man. It is best to mobilize and go to war immediately.

After much hesitation, Attilio said sternly: "After these few months of hard work, the Air Force has accumulated 3,000 fighter jets and 500 bombers...

Once the battle to defend the British Isles begins, we will do our best. Work hard to entangle the enemy's air force and create opportunities for the navy.

Unless our entire army is annihilated, we will never let the enemy's air force interfere in the decisive battle at sea!"

Attilio's heart was bleeding when he was forced to make this decision. But there is no way now. If the air force doesn't attack, the enemy will land on the British Isles.

Regardless of the current strength of the army, it seems that it can defend the British Isles; if there is a war, it will not be possible at all.

Foreign Secretary Adam: "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Japanese government have reached an agreement to introduce 200 pilot suicide squads from Japan, which are expected to arrive in London in twenty days.

At the same time, we have also communicated with the revolutionary parties in various countries. They agreed to mobilize a group of The Air Force can give priority to the enthusiastic young people who join the war.

In addition, we have also funded the national independence movements in France, Poland, Bulgaria, Afghanistan, Finland and other countries. They will launch an uprising in the near future.

Originally, we also found the Hungarian independence organization, but unfortunately they I have lost my fighting spirit and dare not return home to lead the revolution."

I have to admit that John Bull's diplomatic method is to slip away, even if he is in a passive state, he can stir up trouble.

Fortunately, everyone present has experienced strong winds and waves, otherwise they would have thought this was nonsense. They have introduced everything, but this is the first time everyone has heard of the introduction of death squads. I guess this is also the first time since the beginning of the world.

But if you think about it carefully, it's not surprising. Now Japan is eager to show itself and let the Vienna government know that they are not easy to mess with so that they can settle their scores in the future in peace.

The comprehensive national strength cannot be used, and the military's combat effectiveness is mediocre. The only thing that can make everyone afraid is "daring to fight hard."

Only by letting everyone see that the cost of the labor expedition is too high and completely out of proportion to the benefits can the Continental Alliance be able to dispel the idea of ​​settling scores in the future.

To prove this, it is not enough to just play with the Spanish in the Far East. It must be shown in front of European countries. Only when you see it with your own eyes can it be shocking.

It just so happened that at this time, the British were willing to pay a lot of money to introduce "talents", and the two sides hit it off.
